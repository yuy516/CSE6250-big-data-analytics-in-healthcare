fibrillation , and chronic kidney disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 86-year-old woman
with a history of diabetes , chronic kidney disease , congestive
heart failure with ejection fraction of 45% to 50% who presents
from clinic with a chief complaint of fatigue and weakness for
one week. She had had worsening right groin and hip pain , status
post a total hip replacement approximately 13 years ago which had
been worsening for two weeks , and she has also recently completed
a course of Levaquin for urinary tract infection. She presented
to Dr. Parrent office complaining of fatigue and weakness for one
week. She has had some abdominal pain in a band-like
distribution around her right side. She was found to have a
hematocrit of 21 down from 30 eight days ago and was sent to the
emergency department for transfusion and workup of her anemia.

News Irv In She denies tobacco use and drinks alcohol rarely.
ALLERGIES: Codeine and Benadryl.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs were temperature
96.7 , heart rate 60 , blood pressure 153/74 , respirations 22 , and
SaO2 95% on room air. The patient is a frail elderly woman in no
acute distress. She has poor dentition. JVP is difficult to
assess secondary to tricuspid regurgitation. Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam showed bradycardia
with heart rate in the 50s that was irregular , S1 plus S2 with
3/6 systolic murmur heard throughout with mechanical sounding S2.
Abdomen was mildly tender to palpation in the mid epigastrium
with no rebound or guarding. Extremities showed venous stasis
changes in her lower extremities bilaterally. Feet were cool
with diminished DP and PT pulses. On neurological exam , she was
alert and oriented x3 and cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.
STUDIES: EKG showed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular
response with heart rate of 53 , widened QRS , a Q wave in aVL , and
U waves in the lateral leads.
Chest x-ray showed improved pleural effusions and pulmonary edema , stable marked
cardiomegaly.
X-ray of the right hip showed ,
1. Status post right total hip arthroplasty with stable
periprosthetic lucency and cortical remodeling.
2. Severe left hip osteoarthritis.
3. Diffuse atherosclerosis.
EGD on 10/24/06 showed hiatal hernia , fundic polyps with
pathology showing hypoplastic and inflammatory lesions; mild
antral erosions with pathology demonstrating mild regeneration
that was nonspecific and no H. pylori; and duodenitis with
pathology showing normal mucosa but no active bleeding or signs
of recent bleeding.
Capsule endoscopy on 7/5/06 showed a healing gastric ulcer likely in the
antrum , small bowel lymphangiectasia and angioectasia in the distal small
bowel.
Colonoscopy on 9/12/06 demonstrated cecal diverticulum , approximately 3-mm
ascending sessile polyp and several small sessile polyps in the rectosigmoid.
PROCEDURE: Right basilic vein transposition on 9/12/06 by Dr.
Jacinto Goonez .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. GI bleed: In the emergency department , the patient's vital
signs were temperature 95.4 , heart rate 62 , respirations 16 ,
blood pressure 127/66 with SaO2 98% on room air. She was found
to have black guaiac positive stool and GI was consulted. She
was started on IV Nexium 20 mg b.i.d. and was given vitamin K 10
mg subcutaneously and two units of FFP , and she was transfused
three units of packed red blood cells with Lasix 120 mg IV for
each bag. Of note , the patient had a colonoscopy in
Wa on 8/26/05 , which showed bleeding rectal ulcers with
biopsies consistent with ischemic colitis. An EGD on 10/24/06
showed a hiatal hernia; fundic polyps ( path:
hypoplastic/inflammatory ); mild antral erosions ( path: mild
regeneration , nonspecific; no H. pylori ); duodenitis ( path:
normal mucosa ) , but no active bleeding or signs of recent
bleeding. Capsule endoscopy on 7/5/06 showed healing gastric
ulcer likely in the antrum , small bowel lymphangiectasia and
angioectasia in the distal small bowel , which were considered the
likely sources of bleeding. Colonoscopy was performed on
9/12/06 to search for angioectasias for which intervention would
be possible , but demonstrated only a cecal diverticulum and
approximately 3 mm ascending sessile polyp and several small
sessile polyps in the rectosigmoid. The patient was started on
Aranesp but had a 5-point hematocrit drop from 32 to 27 on
9/12/06 for which she required another two units of blood along
with Lasix. The patient's hematocrit remained stable at
approximately 30 to 32 and she will be restarted on
anticoagulation on Thursday , 12/10/06 , one week after her AV
fistula surgery.
2. Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is being
considered for a possible hemodialysis in the future. She was
continued on her Caltrate plus D , multivitamin , and iron
supplementation and she was started on Aranesp 25 mcg weekly and
was given sevelamer 400 mg q.a.c. for elevated phosphate levels.
Vein mapping study was performed on 7/25/06 , and a right basilic
vein transposition was performed on 9/12/06 by Dr. Landrie . The
patient had postoperative right hand coolness , numbness , and
weakness ( always with dopplerable radial pulse ) from steal
versus neurapraxia , which was improved by the time of discharge.
She will follow up with Dr. Chanthasene as an outpatient. The
patient's creatinine was 3.3 on admission , improved to 2.0 by
9/12/06 , which was the day of her surgery and increased again to
3.2 on 1/10/06 .  She was given IV Lasix boluses as she had
evidence of volume overload with over eight-pound weight gain
during her hospitalization , and creatinine improved to 2.7 by the
day of discharge.
3. Cardiovascular:
Pump: The patient's ejection fraction is 45% to 50% and she was
given 120 mg of IV Lasix for each unit of packed red blood cells
she received , along with 120 mg p.o. daily with IV boluses of 180
mg as needed for volume overload as judged by an increase in her
weight. Antihypertensive medications were originally held for
her GI bleed and they were restarted on 10/24/06 with systolic
blood pressures remaining in the 120s to 130s.
Rhythm: The patient has atrial fibrillation with slow
ventricular response with heart rates as low as the upper 30s.
Occasionally , her heart rate appeared regular and was thought to
be junctional escape rhythm. She was asymptomatic throughout her
hospitalization. She was discussed with her cardiologist , Dr.
Fritz , who will consider a pacemaker as an outpatient.
4. Endocrine: She is euthyroid with TSH of 2.422. For her
diabetes , she received nightly Lantus with aspart q.a.c. and
sliding scale when eating and Regular insulin sliding scale q.6h.
when n.p.o. Fingersticks were elevated to 300s early during this
admission but improved to the 100s upon increasing her insulin
dose.
5. Musculoskeletal: The patient is status post right total hip
replacement approximately 13 years ago and complained of right
hip pain upon admission. An x-ray showed stable arthroplasty and
the pain was improved by the morning of 10/24/06 .  She will
follow with physiatrist , Dr. Allan Kofoed .
COMPLICATIONS: Right hand weakness , numbness , and coolness
status post AV fistula surgery , possibly secondary to steal or
neurapraxia , significantly improved by the time of discharge.
CONSULTANTS: Dr. Garfield Kiehne from vascular surgery , Dr. Ambrose Moldrem from gastroenterology.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: Stable vital signs. Lungs
with bibasilar crackles. 3/6 systolic murmur heard throughout
plus a mechanical S2. Abdomen benign. Lower extremities with
chronic venous stasis changes. Right upper extremity AV fistula
with +thrill. Decreased right radial pulse with warm
hand distally , and 4/5 strength in hand grip of the right hand.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Norvasc 5 mg daily , Caltrate plus D one
tablet p.o. b.i.d. , Aranesp 25 mcg subcu weekly , Lovenox 50 mg

ATTENDING: DROEGMILLER , STANTON MD
DATE OF DISCHARGE: Not known at the time of this interim
dictation.
SERVICE: List Medical Center .
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Postpartum cardiomyopathy status post
mitral valve repair , status post tricuspid valve repair , status
post ICD/pacer placement , asthma , and anemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 33-year-old female with a
history of postpartum cardiomyopathy ( EF 15% to 20% ) , status post
pacer/ICD placement , status post mitral valve
replacement/tricuspid valve replacement , who presents with
abdominal pain , decreased appetite , nausea , vomiting , and
occasional chest pain. The patient has had multiple recent
admissions to H/seases Medical Center .  In October 2005 , the
patient presented with chest pain and was found to be in
decompensated heart failure. She ruled out for myocardial
infarction. She was diuresed with torsemide. A MIBI prior to
this admission in October 2005 had showed no evidence of
ischemia. The patient was more recently readmitted in July
2005. During this admission , she underwent mitral valve repair
and tricuspid valve repair given severe mitral regurgitation and
tricuspid regurgitation. She had a catheterization on 6/12/05 ,
which showed normal coronary arteries , no equalization of
diastolic pressures , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19 ,
and 4+ mitral regurgitation. A TTE during this admission showed
an EF of 15% to 20% with wall motion abnormalities. She had mild
right ventricular enlargement and decreased right ventricular
function. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 16 plus right
atrial pressures. She was also found to have a 1.5-cm
pericardial effusion. On this admission , the patient's primary
complaints involve decreased appetite , nausea , vomiting , and
abdominal pain. The patient reports frequent vomiting after
meals. The vomitus is nonbloody and nonbilious. The patient
denies diarrhea , in fact , she has been constipated. Her last
bowel movement was on the day of admission , but she did not have
a bowel movement four to five days prior to this time. She
denies fever or chills. She denies dysuria or hematuria. She
denies melena or bright red blood per rectum. She reports
intermittent shortness of breath , which she believes to be her
baseline. She denies weight gain , orthopnea , or PND. The
patient reports occasional tightness in her left chest , which
occurs a few times each week. There are no associated ischemic
symptoms. The pain is nonexertional and it is pleuritic. In the
emergency room , the patient was afebrile with a pulse of 97 and a
blood pressure of 98/58. Her cardiac enzymes were negative x1.
A PE protocol CT was negative for pulmonary embolus. The patient
was noted on this CAT scan to have a pericardial effusion. The
patient was seen by the Cardiology Service who performed a
bedside echocardiogram , which showed effusion , but no evidence of
right atrial or right ventricular collapse.

shows trace leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 4 to 8 white
blood cells , no red blood cells , and 1+ bacteria. Urine hCG is
negative. Chest x-ray shows stable cardiomegaly without
pulmonary edema or infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia. The patient reported chest pain on admission. The
chest pain was atypical for ischemia and that it was
nonexertional. It was pleuritic and it had no associated
ischemic symptoms. In addition , the patient had normal
coronaries on a recent catheterization in 3/22 as well as a
nonischemic MIBI in October 2005. The patient's enzymes were
negative on this admission. The patient was continued on her
beta-blocker.
b. Pump. The patient has a postpartum cardiomyopathy with an
ejection fraction of 15% to 20%. She also has a pericardial
effusion on this admission. On admission , there was no evidence
of tamponade by exam or by echocardiogram. The patient had a
repeat TTE on 10/18/05 , which showed pericardial effusion , which
was slightly larger than that seen in July 2005. There was
respirophasic variation , but no collapse. The patient's urine
output decreased on 8/26/05 and she underwent right heart
catheterization , which showed extremely elevated right and left
filling pressures ( pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the 40s ,
right atrial pressure 27 ). The patient was initially placed on a
Lasix drip. She was also started on IV dobutamine to maintain
her blood pressure and for perfusion while being diuresed. After
a few days on this regimen , the patient had a repeat right heart
catheterization , which showed improved , but elevated left and
right filling pressures. A Swan catheter was left in place for
closer monitoring of the patient's hemodynamics and to allow for
tailored therapy. At the time of this dictation , the patient
will be tried on various inotropes including dopamine and
dobutamine with close monitoring of her hemodynamics. The
purpose of this is to assess the effect of these inotropes on her
hemodynamics , so there would be a time when she requires inotrope
therapy at home. The patient was also maintained on digoxin.
Her Aldactone was changed to eplerenone given the possibility
that Aldactone could be contributing to the patient's GI
complaints. At the time of this dictation , there is a plan in
place to try to add hydralazine/Isordil to the patient's regimen
for afterload reduction if her blood pressure can tolerate this.
In the past , the patient had suffered severe hypotension when
such medications have been added.
c. Rhythm. The patient is status post pacer/ICD placement. She
was monitored on telemetry. Her telemetry will be followed
closely for any evidence of ectopy while on dobutamine or
dopamine.
2. Pulmonary: The patient has a history of chronic cough. Past
chest CTs have shown ground-glass opacities most likely due to
edema , which have resolved on more recent imaging. Pulmonary
function test in July 2005 showed an FEV1 of 2.06 , FEV1/FVC of
102 , total lung capacity of 3.09 , and a DLCO corrected of 54%
predicted. The patient was continued on Advair and was given
Atrovent p.r.n. As mentioned previously , a PECT on admission was
negative.
3. Renal/FEN: The patient has hypokalemia in the setting of
diuresis. Her electrolytes were monitored b.i.d. and repleted as
needed. The patient's creatinine remained stable less than 1
throughout her admission. The patient was maintained on a
low-salt , food-restricted diet.
4. GI: The patient presented with a number of GI complaints
including abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , and anorexia. It is
not clear what the cause of these symptoms is. The patient had
normal liver function tests. She had a KUB , which showed no
obstruction. Her urine culture showed no evidence of urinary
tract infection. It is possible that abdominal pain was due to
constipation or as a side effect of Aldactone or even to a low
flow state in the setting decompensated heart failure. The
patient was continued on a bowel regimen and a proton pump
inhibitor. At the time of this dictation , the patient's
abdominal complaints have resolved.
5. Heme: The patient has a history of iron-deficiency anemia.
On admission , her hematocrit was 30 with a MCV of 79.4. The
patient takes iron supplementation at home. This was held
temporarily in the setting of constipation. The patient also
takes Coumadin for a low ejection fraction. This is also placed
on hold in the setting of various procedures including her right
heart catheterizations and PA catheter placement. It should be
noted that the patient has a history of HIT positive.
6. ID: On 9/15/05 , the patient had a temperature of 100. This
was status post placement of a PA catheter. There was concern
for a line infection. Blood cultures were drawn and the patient
was started on vancomycin. At the time of this dictation , blood
cultures showed no growths to date , but should continue to be
followed.
7. Psych: The patient has a history of depression. She
appeared dysphoric on admission , but denied any suicidality.
Both Psychiatry and Social Work were contacted who followed the
patient during this admission and who have followed the patient
on previous admission. The Psychiatry Service had recommended
Remeron for sleep , which the patient was given with good effect.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient was given Pneumoboots early on in
her admission and then was out of bed several times each day.
She was also given a proton pump inhibitor.
9. Code: The patient is full code.
The events that occur after the time of this dictation , the
disposition , discharge condition , followup , and discharge
medications will be dictated in an addendum to this discharge
summary.

Discharge Date: 10/8/2005
ATTENDING: SATOW , DARNELL M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
This is a 64-year-old woman with a history of nonischemic
cardiomyopathy who was admitted with increasing volume overload.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Schmittou was doing well until approximately two weeks prior to
admission when in the setting of dietary indiscretion she noticed
some shortness of breath and weight gain. She states that she
started to increase her Demadex from 200 mg in the morning and
150 mg in the afternoon to 200 mg b.i.d. without significant
diuresis. She has continued to participate in cardiac rehab
without significant difficulty. Her weight was stable at 174.
She did , however , noticed worsening of intermittent dyspnea on
exertion and orthopnea , although she denied PND or pedal edema.
She denied abdominal symptoms of bloating , no satiety , nausea or
vomiting. She denied chest pain , discomfort , palpitations ,
lightheadedness or syncope. She does have occasional chest
burning. She also noted burning in her feet bilaterally which
has previously been attributed to neuropathy. On the day of
admission , she presented to the Outpatient Clinic to have an
echocardiogram and repeat exercise stress test with oxygen
uptake. She exercised for 4 minutes and 32 seconds achieving a
peak heart of 90 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 100/64
and stopping secondary to fatigue. Her peak oxygen uptake was
only 9 mL per minute despite on RER of 1.09. This is essentially
unchanged from a prior exercise stress test one year ago.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Includes nonischemic cardiomyopathy diagnosed in 1996 , with clean
coronary catheterization at that point. She has history of
hypertension , hypertriglyceridemia , and left bundle-branch block
status post ICD and pacemaker placement. Her pacer is
biventricular. She also has a history of urine bleeding. She
had a recent hysteroscopy and laparoscopy which were
unremarkable.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Included lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily , Toprol 75 mg p.o. daily ,
Demadex 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Aldactone 25 mg daily , KCl 10 mEq
daily , allopurinol 100 mg daily , colchicine 0.6 mg daily and
Evista 60 mg daily.
ALLERGIES:
Penicillin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She was afebrile with heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 104/66.
Her weight was 174. Her JVP was at approximately 16 cm of water
with hepatojugular reflux to the angle of the jaw. Her carotid
upstrokes were brisk without bruits. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Her cardiac exam was regular in rate
and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and audible S3. She has 2/6
systolic murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation. Her
abdominal exam was benign except for liver edge that is palpable
approximately two fingerbreadths below the costal margin. Her
extremities were noncyanotic with no clubbing or edema. They
were lukewarm.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Unremarkable.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
LABORATORY DATA:
Her most recent labs had showed a sodium of 138 , a potassium 3.9 ,
a BUN of 67 , a creatinine of 1.9 and glucose of 123. Her LFTs
were all normal except for mildly elevated bilirubin of 1.3. Her
last lipids showed a total cholesterol of 128 with 191
triglycerides and HDL of 31 and an LDL of 59. Her last CBC was
unremarkable. Her EKG shows an a-sensed V-paced rhythm at the
rate of 72 beats per minute.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
Cardiovascular: Ms. Helger is a 64-year-old female with
nonischemic cardiomyopathy and class II-III symptoms who
presented with worsening volume overload in the setting of
dietary indiscretion. Given that she is already maximized on her
outpatient diuretic dose and somewhat worsening of her renal
function , she was admitted for further diuresis with IV
torsemide. She was also admitted for the beginning of her
transplant evaluation for potential cardiac transplant. She was
initially started on IV torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. with a goal of 1
to 2 liters of diuresis per day. She was continued on digoxin
and switched over from lisinopril and captopril. Her medications
were adjusted to optimize her diuresis and avoid hypotensive
episodes. She did go for a right heart cath on this
hospitalization that showed increased RA pressure of 14 and a
wedge pressure of 35-44 with V wave. Her cardiac index was
calculated at 1.38. Her SVR was calculated at 1600. Her mixed
venous O2 sat was between 52% and 60% when the readings were
repeated. Given that she appeared quite well and Lasix drip was
started to accelerate her diuresis. She was maintained on
tailored therapy including nitrates for afterload reduction and
the up titration of her captopril. She did have impressive
diuresis on Lasix drip. Her transplant workup at this time
included PFTs that showed an FVC of 2.64 , which his 86% predicted
an FEV1 of 1.82 , which is 75% predicted and FEV1 to FVC ratio of
69%. Her corrected DLCO was 14.6 , which was 56% of predicted.
She did have as well a carotid duplex ultrasound showing no
significant stenosis in either carotid artery. Her ankle
brachial indices were greater than 1 in both lower extremities
and her leg pulse volume recording was all entirely normal. Her
24-hour urine collection showed a value of 920 mg over the total
volume which was in the normal range. She did continued to
respond reasonable well to the diuresis with the exception of a
few episodes of asymptomatic hypotension. Her creatinine did
begin to bump marginally indicating that she had likely been
slightly over diuresed. She subsequently stabilized and was
discharged on a stable dose of diuretics including torsemide 100
mg p.o. b.i.d.
Her other discharge medications include captopril 25 mg t.i.d. ,
Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Claritin , Coumadin 5 mg daily , thiamine and
multivitamin , colchicine , magnesium , Evista , Aldactone 25 mg
daily , digoxin 0.125 mg daily and allopurinol 100 mg daily ,
Toprol-XL 25 mg daily.
She was discharged with plan for regular follow up with her
outpatient cardiologist.

are no splinter hemorrhages. No Osler nodes or red spots. There
is 1+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities. There
are 1+ distal pulses in the upper and lower extremities
bilaterally. Neuro: The patient is alert and oriented x3 and
exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: At the time of admission , sodium 144 , potassium
4.5 , chloride 106 , bicarb 30 , BUN 41 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 83 ,
anion gap is 8. White blood cell count of 8.1 , hematocrit 31.7 ,
platelets 332 , 000. There are 71% neutrophils , 14% lymphocytes
and 12% monocytes. Calcium is 8.7. Urinalysis shows trace
blood , 3+ leukocyte esterase. 40-50 white blood cells , 1-5 red
blood cells , trace bacteria.
STUDIES AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION.
1. Chest x-ray shows status post midline sternotomy and CABG.
There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette , which is
unchanged from prior x-rays. Right lung is clear. There is a
small left posterior pleural effusion , which has been reduced in
size compared to his previous x-ray dated 8/29/07 .
2. EKG revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm with atrial
fibrillation with a rate of 44. There is left axis deviation , a
right bundle-branch block and Q waves in II , III and aVF , which
is unchanged from an EKG in 5/3 .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is an 82-year-old gentleman
with a history of multiple medical problems most significantly
including recent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis , CAD
status post CABG , CHF , atrial fibrillation with a slow
ventricular response who was transferred from rehabilitation with
a fever , positive urinalysis and positive blood cultures with
concerns for endocarditis given his recent AVR. The patient was
initially started on ceftazidime and vancomycin empirically.
Blood cultures were obtained and the patient grew out
two out of two bottles of Gemella morbillorum from his blood.
Urinary cultures were also obtained , which revealed 10 , 000
colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cultures were also taken
from the suprapubic catheter wound site and revealed rare MRSA ,
few coag-negative staph and rare enterococci. Once blood
cultures for Gemella morbillorum returned , the patient's
antibiotics were changed to gentamicin and ceftriaxone on
7/17/07 .  Ceftazidime was discontinued as was vancomycin. The
patient remained afebrile while inhouse and did not exhibit any
significant leukocytosis or stigmata of endocarditis.
Surveillance cultures obtained after starting antibiotics have
remained negative to date. A TTE was obtained and was negative
for any valvular vegetation. However , given the patient's high
risk for endocarditis , a TEE was obtained , which was also
negative for any ring abscess or valvular vegetation. The
patient , however , will be treated for endocarditis given his high
risk.
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient had no chest pain , chest tenderness or
chest discomfort. He does have a history CAD status post CABG
and was continued on his full strength aspirin. He was also
continued on statin.
Pump: The patient was volume overloaded at the time of admission
and was treated with 60 mg of IV Lasix. Following this , he
appeared euvolemic and Lasix was held for several days and then
gradually became volume overload and was again given 60 mg of IV
Lasix and then restarted on his home dose of 80 mg p.o. QAM. At the
time of discharge , the patient is slightly volume overloaded , but
diuresing well with 80 mg daily. The patient's Losartan was held
in the setting of his chronic renal insufficiency and initiation
of gentamicin therapy. At the time of discharge , his weight is
96.6 kg. His I/O goal at time of d/c is 500cc negative daily. He should
continue daily weights. Of note , the patient's dry weight is
approximately 93 kg. Pt's lasix should be titrated as he reaches his dry weight.
Rhythm: The patient is bradycardic at baseline down into the
mid-to-low 30s , is asymptomatic and has in the past refused
permanent pacemaker placement. All nodal agents should be
avoided for this reason. The patient did have several runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia upto 14 beats. Electrolytes
were checked twice daily to keep magnesium above 2 and potassium
above 4. However , no other medical management was initiated
given his bradycardia.
2. Infectious Disease: As noted above , there was high suspicion
for endocarditis in this with a recent AVR. He was found to have
Gemella morbillorum in his blood and was started as noted above
empirically on vancomycin and ceftazidime and then changed to
gentamicin and ceftriaxone on 7/17/07 once gram-positive cocci
were speciated. The patient was initially treated for
pseudomonal UTI with five days of ceftazidime , but given that
only 10000 CFUs grew out , it was decided that ceftazidime
could be discontinued and that there would be some response to
ceftriaxone plus gentamicin. A PICC line was placed on 7/17/07
for continued IV antibiotics and the patient should continue a
full six-week course of ceftriaxone and at least a two-week
course of gentamicin for presumed endocarditis despite
both negative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram
given his high risk for endocarditis.
3. GI: The patient was continued on his home dose of Protonix
and all his stools were guaiaced and were negative in house. The
patient should be continued on p.r.n. Colace.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus. His Lantus was titrated up to 36 units
nightly and at that level required no sliding scale insulin.
5. Renal: The patient was found to have a slightly elevated
creatinine above his baseline on admission ( 1.9 with a baseline
of 1.1 to 1.3 ). This elevated creatinine was thought to likely
be due to his CHF and poor forward flow. As the patient was
diuresed , his creatinine decreased to 1.4 at the time of
discharge. Given his creatinine elevation , however , his Losartan
was held and this should be held while the patient is on gentamicin.
6. GU: The patient has a history of BPH and at the time of
admission had a suprapubic catheter that was inserted in 4/10
due to difficulty to pass Foley catheter. The catheter was
clamped and post-void residuals were checked and were only 50 mL
and the patient was urinating without difficulty with tube clamped ,
so Urology was consulted and suprapubic catheter was pulled
without difficulty. Suprapubic wound was dressed with a sterile
dry dressing to be changed daily.
7. Fluids , Electrolytes and Nutrition: The patient has a
current input and output goal of 0.5 L negative daily. He is on a 2L fluid
restriction.
Electrolytes. The patient has been having twice daily
electrolyte checks to keep his magnesium above 2 and his
potassium above 4 given his arrhythmias while he is on 80 mg of
Lasix daily. This should be continued.
Nutrition. The patient was placed on a cardiac , 2-gm sodium
diet and a 2 L fluid restriction.
8. Pulmonary: The patient is to continue on Flovent and
albuterol.
9. Heme: The patient was continued on Niferex twice daily for
iron deficiency anemia. He was also found to have a very mild
eosinophilia , which should be followed.
10. Derm: The patient was found to have a skin tear on his
right hand. This is being treated with neomycin ointment and
sterile dry dressing changes daily.
11. Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin
5000 units three times daily and continued on his PPI.
CODE: The patient is full code.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
IDENTIFICATION: 73F w/ a h/o recent anterior STEMI ( 9/22 ) c/b apical
aneurysm , apical thrombus , and ischemic cardiomyopathy w/ most recent EF
35% admitted from home w/ increasing DOE and fatigue.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mrs. Chepiga is a lovely 73yo woman who presented in 9/22 with 3 days of
epigastric and chest pain and was found to have a STEMI. She
subsequently underwent DES to ramus and LAD. Flow through the LAD was
only TIMI 2 by the end of the procedure. Course was complicated by
post-MI pericarditis , apical wall thinning , and mural LV thrombus.
She was discharged initially to short-term rehab , then subsequently went
home w/ weekly f/u w/ cardiac rehab. While at short term rehab , she was
treated w/ doses of lasix as high as 120 mg IV. Following discharge from
rehab , she was ultimately taken off of diuresis b/c of ""dizzy spells"" she
was experiencing while on lasix.
She did well off lasix until 2 weeks ago , when she was noted to have
decreased exercise tolerance and increasing fatigue at cardiac rehab.
She says that she is usually able to ambulate for 15 minutes on the
treadmill; she hasn't been able to do this for the past 2 weeks b/c of
dyspnea and fatigue. This has been accompanied by new-onset PND
( occurring as frequently as 3-5 times/night ) , 5 pound weight gain , and
increasing abdominal girth. She does acknowledge dietary indiscretion
this past week ( had a can of mushroom soup 4 days ago ). No orthopnea.
Mrs. Bloxsom cardiac rehab. contacted Dr. Takach ( her primary
cardiologist ) a few days ago to inform her about Mrs. Losey DOE and
increasing fatigue. Starting 2 days ago , she was placed on lasix 40 mg.
Since then , she has taken a total of 5 doses. She came to urgent care
this PM and was noted to desat. to 85% w/ ambulation in the setting of
fluid overload. She was subsequently admitted.

CXR: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
7/5/2006 ECHO: Mildly dilated left ventricle ( systolic diameter: 3.57
cm and diastolic diameter: 5.89 cm ). Overall left ventricular function
moderately reduced w/ EF 35%. Anteroseptal wall is akinetic from
midventricular level to apex , and hypokinetic at the base. Focal basal

11/26 ETT: Duration 3'20'' and stopped d/t fatigue. Attained 4.7 METS.
Maximum heart rate 125 at 85% of predicted. Maximal blood pressure
130/70. ECG ST changes of accentuation of baseline ST , T wave
abnormalities. Apparently , low HR recovery. Imaging w/ large myocardial
scar in the proximal LAD territory. Small and mild myocardial ischemia
in the OM territory ( small defect involving the basal inferolateral

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: 73F w/ a h/o recent anterior STEMI ( 9/22 ) c/b
apical aneurysm , apical thrombus , and ischemic cardiomyopathy w/ most
recent EF 35% admitted from home w/ increasing DOE and new-onset PND.
Appears to be fluid overloaded , improved w/ diuresis over 3 day
hospitalization.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. CARDS PUMP: Volume overloaded w/ ischemic CMP implicated.
Initially received IV diuresis w/ lasix 80 mg IV bid and was ~2.5 liters
negative. SBP down to 80 following overdiuresis on 6/14 held diuresis
on 10/7 .  Resumed oral regimen w/ lasix 40 mg po qdaily on 10/5 .
Discharged on lasix 20 mg po qdaily. Continued spironolactone 25 mg po
qdaily. Increased lisinopril to 30 mg po qdaily to optimize heart
failure regimen at admission; changed to 15 mg po qdaily on 10/7 after
SBP dropped to 10/7 .  Also , she had apparently been taking this
inconsistently as well.
2. CARDS ISCHEMIA: No active issues. Recent ETT w/ small reversible
defect involving the basal inferolateral wall. Continued ASA , plavix ,
lipitor.
3. CARDS RHYTHM: W/ known ischemic cardiac disease and EF~35% ( down
to 31% on post-stress by MIBI ) , inclined for AICD placement ( MADIT ).
Discussed w/ EP and she will see Dr. Pippens as an outpatient. Repeat Echo
4/3/06 w/ estimated EF 40%. Defer decision on EP eval to primary
cardiologist Dr. Dewolf
4. PULM: Hypoxia in the setting of volume overload. Weaned O2 w/
adequate diuresis.
5. HEME: 9/22 course c/b LV thrombus , has been on
anticoagulation. Repeat echo. w/o thrombus , however apex quite akinetic
and contrast study with stagnant flow concerning for high risk of thrombus
recurrence. Therefore , warfarin was continued in addition to ASA and
plavix. The decision to continue these three medications is deferred to
pt's primary cardiologist , Dr. Navejas . Pt has INR drawn locally but is
managed by the CDMC coumadin clinic and will f/u with them.
6. ENDO: Initially on regimen of lantus , lispro , and sliding scale.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Sick sinus syndrome.
4. Delirium.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. Diabetes , newly diagnosed.
2. Chronic anticoagulation.
3. Hypertension.
4. History of GI bleed.
5. Prior CVA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Stonerock is an 89-year-old male with a history of multiple
medication problems , including hypertension , atrial fibrillation ,
sick sinus syndrome , history of colon cancer and prostate cancer ,
status post embolic stroke in 3/22 , and history of congestive
heart failure with an EF of 40-50% , who presented to the
emergency room complaining of two days of increased lethargy. At
that time , he denied cough , chest pain , shortness of breath , PND
or orthopnea. In the emergency room , the patient was found to
have a heart rate in the 120s with a new left bundle-branch
block. Carotid massage was attempted and the patient blocked to
15:1 due to sick sinus syndrome. An echocardiogram was done in
the emergency room , which revealed an EF of 25%. It was felt
that the patient was in acute congestive heart failure
exacerbation secondary to the atrial fibrillation with RVR. It
was deemed at that time too dangerous to pharmacologically
convert the patient. He was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit for placement of a transvenous pacer.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Arthritis.
3. Atrial fibrillation , on anticoagulation.
4. History of prostate cancer , status post prostatectomy.
5. History of colon cancer , status post partial colectomy.
6. History of dementia.
7. History of GI bleed.
8. Status post MRSA wound infection.
9. Status post embolic CVA in 6/17/05 .
10. Sick sinus syndrome.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Colace.
2. Coumadin.

ALLERGIES:
No known allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient denies cigarette , drug or alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY:
The patient had a father who died at the age of 63 of a heart
attack. There is a family history of colon cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Afebrile , pulse irregular , 125; blood pressure 140/100. Pulse
oximetry was 97% on 2 liters. General: This is an elderly male
in no acute distress. Neck: Supple , no lymphadenopathy , no
thyroid enlargement , JVP at 18 cm with flutter waves. Carotids
are 2+ bilaterally. Pulmonary: Bibasilar rales.
Cardiovascular: Irregular rate and rhythm , tachycardic , S1 , S2
normal. No murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen: Soft , nontender
and nondistended. Bowel sounds are present. Extremities: Warm
bilaterally , 2+ pitting lower extremity edema. No clubbing or
cyanosis.
LABORATORY STUDIES UPON ADMISSION:
Notable for mild elevation of the white blood cell count of 11.0 ,
hematocrit of 40.6 , and platelets of 218 , 000. Electrolytes were
within normal limits. The creatinine was mildly elevated at 1.3.
BNP was markedly elevated at 7931. Coagulation showed an INR of
2.9. LFTs were within normal limits. Cardiac enzymes showed a
CK of 129 , CK-MB of 5.9 , and an elevated troponin at 0.27. EKG:
Atrial flutter with RVR , rate in the 120s , and new left
bundle-branch block. Chest x-ray: Cardiomegaly and
cephalization , no acute infiltrate.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN UPON ADMISSION:
This is an 89-year-old male with a history of sick sinus
syndrome , atrial fibrillation , on Coumadin , as well as congestive
heart failure , who was admitted for atrial fibrillation/atrial
flutter with RVR , and decompensated congestive heart failure. At
the time of admission , the patient was felt to be at risk
secondary to his sick sinus syndrome and new left bundle-branch
block. He was felt to be at risk for asystole and symptomatic
bradycardia with any blocking agents. Therefore , transvenous
pacer was scheduled to be placed in the Cath Lab.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Rhythm: Shortly after admission , the patient had a temporary
ventricular pacer placed on 9/13/05 with a heart rate of less
than 50. After the procedure , the patient was admitted to the
CCU with atrial flutter with RVR and a rate in the 20s. The rate
was intermittently controlled with a combination of IV digoxin
and Lopressor. On 6/6/05 , a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker
was implanted with VVI at 50. Throughout the next two days , the
patient's heart rate continued to be difficult to control , but
improved with diltiazem. The patient was initiated on an
amiodarone load on 8/22/05 .  The following day , he converted to
normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. At that time , he continued to
be ventricularly paced , and the pacemaker was changed to DDD on
10/21/05 .  For the remainder of the hospitalization , the patient
remained in normal sinus rhythm and was dual-paced without any
recurrence of arrhythmias. He will be continued on his
amiodarone load , which was 2.9 g upon discharge and we continued
for a total load of 10 g.
b. Pump: Upon admission , an echocardiogram on 5/23/05 showed
an EF of 20-25% with regional wall motion abnormalities noted in
the intraventricular septum , which was akinetic as well as global
hyperkinesis of the left ventricle. On admission , the patient
had indications of heart failure , including increased JVP and
bilateral lower extremity edema , as well as pulmonary effusions.
The patient was diuresed effectively with low-dose IV Lasix. His
admission weight was 91 kg , and upon discharge , it was
approximately 87 kg. The patient was given intermittent Lasix 10
mg IV for diuresis to maintain a negative I&O of 500 mL. Upon
discharge , the patient may require continued diuresis with home
regimen of p.o. Lasix. In addition , the patient was noted to
have marked hypertension throughout his stay. Blood pressure was
occasionally difficulty to control , and at times , required IV
nitro drip. Systolic blood pressures were noted to as high as
180 and as low as 100 with IV nitro drip. The patient's blood
pressure was managed with calcium channel blocker , beta-blocker ,
as well as ACE inhibitor. Upon transfer to the cardiology floor
on 10/21/05 , the p.o. diltiazem was increased. Upon discharge ,
the patient will be continued on a home regimen of lisinopril 10
mg p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and diltiazem
extended release 360 mg p.o. daily. At the time of discharge ,
the patient's blood pressure was well controlled with systolic
blood pressures ranging from 110 to 120s.
c. Ischemia: Upon admission , the patient had cardiac enzyme
elevation with initially 0.27 , which elevated to a max of 1.27 on
10/23/05 .  Initially , the enzyme elevations were thought to be
secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of an elevated heart
rate and volume overload. However , the patient underwent a
cardiac catheterization on 2/25/05 which showed evidence of
coronary artery disease , two-vessel disease , specifically , there
was a LAD proximal 90% lesion as well as diffuse proximal-mid
standing 80% lesion , as well as RTLV-BR mid discrete 80% lesion
beyond the bifurcation of RPDA. On 2/25/05 , the patient had a
successful roto-ablation , angioplasty , and insertion of three
cipher DES to the LAD resulting in TIMI 2 flow. On 1/1/05 , the
patient returned to the cath lab , and at that time , he had a DES
placement at distal RCA. The patient denied a chest pain
throughout his stay. Upon discharge , he was able to ambulate
without significant dyspnea on exertion or chest discomfort.
2. Psychiatry: At the beginning of the hospital stay , the
patient was confused and somewhat agitated. His behavior was
controlled with Haldol as well as p.r.n. Ativan. The patient's
confusion and delirium improved significantly , and the Haldol and
Ativan were tapered off. Prior to discharge , he was reinitiated
on his home regimen of Zyprexa. The patient has a longstanding
history of dementia. Geriatrics consult followed in this case
and advised on titration of a Haldol.
3. Vascular: Following the cardiac catheterization , the patient
was noted to have a right femoral bruit. A vacular ultrasound
was obtained on 7/18/05 and did not show any evidence of an AV
fistula.
4. Heme: The patient is on chronic anticoagulation for atrial
fibrillation. Upon admission , his INR was 2.9 and became
elevated to a supratherapeutic level. Therefore , his Coumadin
was held. The patient will be reinitiated on Coumadin when his
INR is below 2. Goal INR will be between 2 and 3.
5. Endocrine: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and
was continued on his home dose of Synthroid 25 mcg p.o. daily.
Thyroid function tests were checked and were within normal
limits. In addition , the patient was noted to have mildly
elevated fasting blood glucoses during his admission. His blood
sugars ranged from 95 to 182. He was maintained on a regular
sliding scale insulin and required only minimal units of
supplemental insulin. A hemoglobin A1c was ordered , and the
results are still pending at this time.
6. GI: The patient was noted to have significant constipation
throughout his stay and was continued on an aggressive bowel
regimen , which included Colace , senna , lactulose , and Dulcolax.
The patient has a history of GI bleed. He was noted to have a
small amount of blood in the stools secondary to constipation ,
but this was resolved with additional bowel movements. His
hematocrit remained stable , with no signs of anemia. The patient
does have a history of colon cancer for which he underwent a
colectomy. He will be followed as an outpatient.
7. FEN: Due to the patient's heart failure , he was placed on a
2-liter fluid restriction as well as 2 g salt restriction. The
patient was continued on a low-cholesterol , low-salt diet. Due
to his mild sedation with Haldol , the patient was evaluated by
speech and swallow and initially placed on mechanical soft diet
with some honey-thick liquids. As his mental status improved
significantly , the patient was returned to a house diet ,
low-cholesterol , low-fat , with the previous salt and fluid
restrictions. The patient was continued on light scale
throughout his stay.
8. ID: The patient was noted to have a urinary tract infection
based on urinalysis upon admission. His culture remained
negative throughout his stay. He was initially given
ceftriaxone. Initially , he was started on Keflex following on
pacemaker placement for antibiotic coverage , which was
discontinued on 1/12/05 .  The patient remained afebrile , with no
signs of systemic infection throughout his stay.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on a PPI. His INR
remained subtherapeutic throughout his stay.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.

ADDENDUM
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes ,
hypertension , CAD status post MI in 2000 who presented with an ST
elevation MI to the Emergency Room on 8/23/06 .  He was brought
to Cath where he was found to have in-stent thrombosis in his LAD. The clot was
aspirated and bare-metal stent was placed in his LAD
and another stent was placed in his diag-2. He suffered multiple V-Tach
cardiac arrests requiring CPR and cardioversion. In the
Cath Lab , he was given bicarb , placed on the epi drip , given
Lasix and was intubated. He was thought to aspirate at the time
of intubation secondary to vomiting. A bedside echo revealed
global hypokinesis with an EF of 35%. He , at that time , was
placed on a balloon pump , dopamine 16 , amio 1 , propofol 1 , and
Integrilin and brought to the CCU. On the floor , his blood
pressures were difficult to control and his PA catheter readings
indicated a wedge pressure of 47. His MAPs were marginal and max dopamine , max
Levophed , epinephrine and dobutamine were required to maintain a minimal blood
pressure.
His family was aware of his prognosis and was there at the time
of his arrest at 3:30 in the morning. CPR was initiated , and
ACLS was performed until the family decided to terminate the ACLS. At that
time , there were no spontaneous breath sounds , no heart sounds , and nonreactive
pupils. The cause of death was thought to be cardiogenic shock
secondary to ST elevation MI. His time of death was 3:47 a.m. on 8/23/06 .

Hospital Course:
+CV: No evidence of acute coronary event ( ekg , enzymes unremarkable ). Due
to med noncompliance ( pt ran out med ) , pt was hypertensive with sbp >
200. Pt's home medications listed above were restarted and blood pressure
normalized to sbp 120-140's.
During hospitalization , CK's trended up ( peak 872 , at discharge 675 ) but
troponin stayed less than assay. Pt has long history of elevated CK's.
Suspect his elevation may be due to lipitor. Pt denied myalgias or chest
pain. Defer to pcp for consideration of switching to other statins that
may not cause elevation of CK. In interim , will pt will not be continued on
lipitor; we have also discharged pt on labetolol 800 mg BID as recommended
by his outpatient cardiologist at his most recent visit.
Pt also had episode of NSVT ( 12 beats ) during hospitalization. Echo
revealed concentric LVH with EF 45% , slightly decreased from prior; but
essentially unchanged from previous echo. EKG without changes as compared
with ekg 4/3 .  Discussed with cardiology service who felt that given EF and
history of LV dysfunction , no indication for pacemaker. Follow up arranged
with patient's cardiologist ( Dr. Rucki ) and pcp ( Dr. Bendit ).
+ID: ?C. diff. Pt reported several days worth of diarrhea daily. Given
h/o C. diff , started treating empirically. Pt was unable to provide stool
sample as he had no episodes of diarrhea during hospitalization. Given
h/o C. diff , will continue flagyl and lactobacillus as outpatient for 11
additional days.
+Renal: ESRD on HD. Pt dialyzed on admission with some improvement in BP.
+Endo: DM. Ct home regimen of lantus qam.

and not cooperative. Agitation responded well to trazodone and pt was
able to sleep overnight. Pt resides in group home with access to mental
health resources.

dehydration , polyarticular joint soreness and left hip pain. For
his hyperkalemia , the patient was treated with calcium ,
gluconate , insulin , Kayexalate and his potassium level returned
to normal levels by hospital day #2. For his acute renal
failure , the patient was hydrated gently with 60 cc of normal
saline. The renal service was consulted and assisted with
management. The patient was urinating. Renal ultrasound was
normal. Renal function returned to baseline and his creatinine
at discharge was 1.4. His baseline is 1.6. With correction of
his renal function , the patient regained strength. For his joint
symptoms , Rheumatology was consulted who performed arthrocentesis
of the left knee and diagnosed polyarticular gout. No treatment
was initiated in the setting of impaired renal function and a
concern for fluid retention. He has a followup appointment with
Rheumatology in September 2005. For his hip pain , his orthopedist ,
Dr. Schuchmann , evaluated him for possible future hip surgery.
Neurology was consulted regarding atrophy of thenar muscles and
elevated CPK. They did not feel a secure diagnosis could be made
and recommended following daily CPK , which trended down over the
course of hospitalization. Followup appointment in Neurology was
scheduled to discuss essential tremor and further investigate the
muscle wasting with nerve conduction studies and EMG if necessary
based on CPK levels. The patient had an echocardiogram on
hospital day #2 , which showed an ejection fraction of 40 to 45% ,
no pericardial effusion , and hypokinesis of the mid and distal
septum , mid and distal inferior wall and decreased global right
ventricular function. The patent foramen ovale was visualized.
At discharge , the patient was afebrile , hemodynamically stable ,
euvolemic , ambulating , and saturating on room air , and on a
stable medical regimen. He was followed by VNA at home starting
February , 2005 , for INR checks.
Followup appointments for Cardiology , Neurology , and Rheumatology
were put in place. The patient was asked to contact his primary
care physician to schedule a followup appointment.
On admission , the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically
stable.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
76 year old woman with CHF , moderate MR , PAF , HTN , and obesity who
presented with left upper arm pain since 3 pm the day of admission.
Denies any SOB , CP , N/V , diaphroresis. Took 5 baby aspirin at
home without relief of pain. Pain came on at rest. No history of
recent trauma. In ED , MSO4 relieved most of pain. Pain was noted to be
positional , increasing when arm is stretched down. Reports
increasing SOB over last several months , increased leg edema with 10
lb weight gain. No orthopnea or PND. PE: HR 58-61 , BP 141/81 98% RA.
PE: tenderness to palpation over L deltoid with pain with resistance to
abduction ( +supraspinatus involvement ). Full ROM in bilateral
shoulders. Chest: CTA bil. Neck: JVP 7 cm. ECG: 1st degree AVB , no
ischemic changes. CXR: no acute cardiopulmonary changes. Initial
enzymes flat. BNP 120
Hospital course.
The shoulder pain was felt to be secondary to supraspinatus
tendonitis/strain. The patient was advised to take a short course of
ibuprofen and was given shoulder exercises to do by physical therapy.
In addition , patient reports increased leg edema , SOB , and weight
gain. She ruled out for MI by enzymes and ECGs. By exam , much of the
changes in her legs appeared chronic. She did not appear to be in
respiratory CHF by exam or BNP. She does admit to dietary
indiscretions over the past few weeks. She was kept on her current
medications doses , including lasix 80 mg BID and instructed to keep a
daily weight log. A follow-up appointment was made for her with Dr.
Roginson on 6/3/03 .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Daily weights each am. Please record to show Dr. Ciminera .
2. Low salt , fluid-restricted diet
3. Ibuprofen 400 mg three to four times per day until you see Dr.
Pruzansky for shoulder pain. Please take with food.
4. Shoulder exercises as demonstrated by physical therapy.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:

ATTENDING: GOETZE , BURTON M.D.
DATE OF BIRTH: 3/23/1927 .
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Hypovolemia and fatigue.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , hypertension ,
hyperlipidemia , peptic ulcer disease , severe anxiety ,
cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction between 15% and 20% , and 2+
mitral regurgitation.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Weakness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old male with a
history of coronary artery disease status post silent MI and
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction between 15% and 20% , who
has a longstanding history of severe anxiety and presented with
fatigue and shortness of breath. On the day of admission , the
patient took an extra dose of Lasix because he thought that he
might be fluid overloade. In the emergency room , it was thought
that he appeared dry and he was admitted for volume
resuscitation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , silent MI in
1998 , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , peptic ulcer disease with GI
bleed , severe anxiety , cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction
previously reported at 20% in October 2005 , 2+ mitral
regurgitation , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix 20 mg to 40 mg daily , aspirin
325 daily , Lipitor 5 mg daily , Toprol XL 25 daily , Valium 5 mg
t.i.d. p.r.n. , Accupril 5 mg daily and Aleve p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa causes rash and ciprofloxacin causes
hallucinations.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is an Irish descendent. He lives
alone with many cats. Drinks occasional ethanol , no tobacco or
illicit drugs. He is retired.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Temperature 95.6 , heart rate 112 ,
blood pressure 153/90 with orthostasis , respiratory rate 18 , 97%
oxygen on room air. General: No acute distress , alert. Pupils
are equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation
bilaterally. Extraocular motor intact. His oropharynx is clear.
Dry mucous membranes. Neck: Supple , JVP flat. Lungs: Clear
to auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Tachycardic with occasional
premature heartbeats. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen:
Nondistended , soft and nontender. Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities: No edema , clubbing , or cyanosis. Neuro: The
patient was oriented. Cranial nerves III through XII intact.
Strength is 5/5 throughout. The sensation was intact throughout.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Upon admission , the patient appeared dry and
was resuscitated with one liter of IV fluids. The patient's
Lasix was held initially on admission. On hospital day #2 , he
was looking well. His weight was 151 pounds which was suspected
to be close to his dry weight which was reportedly 149 pounds.
By 8/18/05 , he was restarted on 20 mg of Lasix daily so that he would stay
euvolemic. He received intermittent IV Lasix ( 20mg ) throughout the remainder
of his hospitalization and his p.o. Lasix dose was settled on 40 mg p.o.
daily. His captopril was restarted on the 9/19/05 at 6.25 mg t.i.d. He
tolerated that dose and was switched to Accupril 2.5 mg b.i.d. He underwent an
echocardiogram on 11/9/05 which demonstrated possible vegetation
on the tricuspid valve verus a flail leaflet. This question of a
vegetation raised concern for possible endocarditis and blood
culture were sent. The patient's temperature had been low on
admission , since there was some concern that he could be
developing sepsis , however nothing grew from the blood cultures
throughout the remainder of his hospitalization. He was seen by
Cardiology , who did not think that this echo result required
further intervention and suspected that it represented a flail
tricuspid valve leaflet. The patient's troponin
One troponin level was elevated at 0.11 initially and then
another troponin was elevated on 10/27/05 in the setting ARF and
acute hepatitis. He recently had a negative stress echo at the
Laketon Medical Center , so no additional stress testing
was pursued during this admission. He was switched to Lopressor
25 t.i.d. and then switched back to Toprol XL. His statin was
discontinued during the admission because of LFT abnormalities
which will be discussed below. He was monitored on telemetry
which demonstrated frequent PVCs and some NSVT. This
should be readdressed in Cardiology Clinic. Cardiology decided to hold off on
placing an AICD and was to see him as an outpt.
2. GI/renal: On the morning of 10/27/05 , the patient developed new confusion
and delirium. He also developed an oxygen
requirement the night before. His labs on morning were notable
for a transaminitis in the thousands , acute renal failure with
hyperkalemia and acidemia with bicarbonate of 13 , and a new leukocytosis ( WBC 9
to 25 ). He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including coverage for
bartonella as he had many cats. He was empirically started on mucomyst and
acyclovir as per GI in case his LFT abnormalities were due to tylenol
toxicity or HSV. He was initially going to get a liver biopsy but this was
cancelled as his LFTs started to normalize. He had a RUQ with dopplers which
was negative. The etiology of his hepatitis , renal failure and leukocytosis was
never identified throughout the admission. Cardiology did not think that any
of this could be explained by endocarditis and his antibiotics were stopped
once his cultures were negative for multiple days. GI though he could of had
shock liver but he was on telemetry the entire time. His tylenol level was
normal and his hep seriologies were negative. His labs had all normalized by
admission except for his LFTs which were still trending downward.
3. Infectious disease: Due to low temperature and question of
vegetation , there was consideration for endocarditis and sepsis
although that never panned out. He has a history of feeding
stray cats and so bartonella cultures were sent. They take a
long time to come back and should be followed up as outpatient. He had been
placed on antibiotics while awaiting cultures but those were discontinued on
the 8/18/05 as the microbiology data remains negative. He had a CT scan of his
chest and abdomen which did not reveal any infectious source. He had ground
glass opacities on his CT chest which were felt to be due to CHF when reviewed
with the radiologist. He remained afebrile during the admission.
4. Psych: Early on during the patient's admission , he did have
several episodes of tachypnea at rest. They were not positional in nature
and resolved with verbal consolation and redirection and
deep breath. No associated desaturation at that time. The
patient has a history of anxiety and reported that that prompted
him to increase his Lasix dose at home. He refused psychiatric
consultation or social work involvement. His Valium had
initially been initiated but it was held in the setting of
abnormal LFTs. He had no further anxiety attacks after that. It
is likely that he has mild baseline dementia. His delirium
resolved after the acute renal failure and transaminitis resolved.
5. Musculoskeletal: The patient had a little bit of difficulty
ambulating and was seen by Physical Therapy who did think that
further physical therapy would be appropriate. The patient
refused to go to rehabilitation facility , so he was planning to
go home with services including physical therapy at home.
6. Hematology: The patient was set to go home and then it was
noted that his platelets had taken a slow and steady decline
throughout his hospitalization while he was on heparin/Lovenox. There
was concern that this could represent heparin induced
thrombocytopenia and so all heparin products were stopped. He was placed
lepirudin which was chosen instead of Argatroban because
Argatroban was cleared by liver in light of his hepatitis.
His initial PF4 was read as bordeline positive , but the laber later
changed the result to negative. Based on this discrepancy another PF4 was
sent which was borderline positive. As per the hematology consult , they felt
that despite the borderline positive PF4 he did not need prophylactic
anticoagulation and that he should refrain from heparin products in the
future until a repeat PF4 in checked in a few months.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg daily ,
Toprol XL 25 mg daily , Accupril 5 mg daily , omeprazole 20 mg
daily.
DIET: Low sodium.
ACTIVITY: As tolerated with supervision and advised by the
physical therapist.
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: Dr. Dougall is the patient's new PCP at
the GHAM MILL RIDOWN MEDICAL CENTER clinic at the Atl Hospital , he has an
appointment for 3/23/05 at 9:45 a.m. and an appointment with Dr.
Alquisira was made from Cardiology 10/21/05 at 2:45 p.m.
ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Do not take Valium or Lipitor until you
are cleared by your doctor to do so due to liver function. Weigh
yourself daily and keep a record and bring that to follow up
appointment. If you develop light headedness , shortness of
breath , chest pain or any other symptoms you are concerned about ,
call your doctor or return to the Pi Hospital emergency room for evaluation.

RADIOLOGIC DATA: Ultrasound of the abdomen showed no evidence of
portal vein thrombosis. Portable chest x-ray on 10/27/05 showed
the lung volumes considerably decreased from the previous exam on
9/29/05 .  There is hazy opacity in the lower lung sounds
particularly on the right suggesting mild edema. There also
appears to be small right effusion , mild cardiomegaly is again
noted. On 10/27/05 , CAT scan of the abdomen showed no apparent
source of infection , no collection or abscess , limited study
secondary to lack of IV contrast , mild ascites , bilateral pleural
effusions right greater than left with subsegmental atelectasis ,
presacral edema and cardiomegaly with left coronary artery
calcification. CAT scan of the chest on 10/27/05 showed
bilateral small pleural effusion , evidence of pulmonary edema and
small volume ascites associated with cardiomegaly , nodular ground
glass opacities at the right base may be due to atelectasis but
somewhat discrete , cannot exclude septic emboli but would be very
localized. A head CT on 9/29/05 showed no acute intracranial
abnormality.

Discharge Date:
CARDIOLOGY RII TERMROA UNIVERSITY OF SERVICE
ID: The patient is a 53 year old woman with a history of coronary
artery disease , status post myocardial infarction in 1986 ,
congestive heart failure who was admitted for congestive heart
failure exacerbation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has a history of diabetes ,
coronary artery disease , hypertension
not well controlled , congestive heart failure who presented with
increasing swelling , shortness of breath , and some chest pain over
the past week to two weeks and weight gain over the past month.
The patient admits to having injuried her knee while climbing a
mountain in Vocouta Na Hisa almost two months ago and having to be in
a knee immobilizer for that period of time. Was unable to do much
ambulation and was not able to cook with low salt foods as a result
of her immobility. She says the swelling then occurred. She
attempted to increase the level of diuretics that she takes at
home , which has not helped , and now present with some mild chest
pain and congestive heart failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for 20
years , hypertension not well controlled ,
coronary artery disease , status post inferior myocardial infarction
1986 , peripheral neuropathy , retinopathy , nephropathy , mild
congestive heart failure , possible pneumonia in the past , and
mitral insufficiency.
MEDICATIONS: Elavil 50 milligrams , aspirin 325 milligrams ,
Atenolol 50 milligrams b.i.d. , Lasix 40 milligrams
p.o. q.d. , insulin , lactulose 30 milliliters q.i.d. , Prilosec 20
milligrams p.o. q.i.d. , Zocor 20 milligrams p.o. q.h.s. ,
lisinopril , Tiazac 180 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. , Cozaar 50 milligrams
p.o. b.i.d.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted , ruled out for an
myocardial infarction , and began diuresis.
Required 80 milligrams intravenous Lasix , then to twice a day , and
increase that to 100 , and then 200 intravenous Lasix twice a day
and added 500 milligrams of Diuril twice a day. The patient began
to respond to the initial diuresis. Was unable to obtain an MRI to
evaluate her renal arteries , secondary to claustrophobia and
orthopnea. On July required addition of clonidine for not
well controlled blood pressure into the 180s and 190s/100 , .
Changed Captopril to ramipril for better lipophilic absorption. On
July Lasix was increased and Clonidine was also increased
from 2.5 to 5 for better diuresis and blood pressure control. The
patient was noted to have a hyperproliferative normal MCV anemia ,
was begun on erythropoietin; however , her level came back to 15
which is normal limits. An echocardiogram in October 2000 showed an
ejection fraction of 60% , normal size and function , 2-3+ mitral
regurgitation. A repeat echocardiogram done on April
showed 4+ mitral regurgitation with decreased function and an
ejection fraction of 45-50%. The patient had a chest x-ray that
showed continued pleural effusions and pulmonary edema , compared to
admission , somewhat improved. Sputum was done and had a gram stain
showing 4+ polys , gram positive cocci in clusters and chains , and a
culture which had 1+ oral flora. On March the patient
continued to diuresis well. On August creatinine to 2.6 up

Discharge Date: 9/13/1993
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: IDIOPATHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old Hispanic
female with a history of idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy for the past ten years. Patient has been
managed medically , however , recently , the patient's heart failure
has progressed to the point where conventional therapy is unable to
sustain her. The patient was admitted in September 1993 with dyspnea and
chest pain. At that time , the patient ruled out for myocardial
infarction and was discharged home on exogenous oxygen therapy.
Patient returned shortly thereafter with shortness of breath and
was begun on intravenous Dobutamine. She was subsequently
discharged home after her heart failure resolved. Patient ,
however , returned a third time with similar complaints of shortness
of breath and dyspnea and remained in the hospital awaiting a heart
transplant. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of
non-Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as a history of
treated tuberculosis. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Patient has a
history of total abdominal hysterectomy and right
salpingo-oophorectomy. Patient has no known tobacco or ethanol
history. Catheterization on May demonstrated a pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 38 with a pulmonary artery pressure of
80 systolic/50 diastolic. Cardiac index was 1.4 and an echo
demonstrated severely dilated left ventricle with an ejection
fraction of between 25 and 30%. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lasix 120 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Vasotec 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , and
two liters nasal cannula O2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was a sickly appearing female who
was short of breath. HEENT: Unremarkable.
NECK: Remarkable for jugular venous distention to the angle of the
jaw. CARDIAC: III/VI holosystolic murmur appreciated with an S3
gallop. ABDOMEN: Liver was 13 to 14 cm. Otherwise , the abdomen
was soft. EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting edema to the mid shin.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: BUN was 24 , creatinine 1.2 , PT was 16.1 ,
PTT was 34 , white count was 8 , hematocrit
49% , and digoxin was 1.4. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 110
with a left bundle-branch block pattern and first degree AV block.
Chest X-Ray revealed cardiomegaly and liver function tests were
grossly normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient underwent a heart transplant on October
without perioperative difficulty. The patient
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit immediately
post-operatively and remained there for her first several days
post-operatively. The patient's early post-operative course was
complicated by right sided heart dysfunction and elevated PA
pressures. Echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular
function. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction
post-operatively and was managed on Dobutamine and Inocor. As PA
pressures remained elevated , the patient was switched to Milrinone
and her other pressors were weaned off gradually. The patient had
chest tubes left in place for approximately twelve days
post-operatively at which time the chest tubes were discontinued.
Patient's Swan was removed on post-operative day ten and CVP
monitoring was used to estimate right heart function. The
patient's Milrinone was gradually weaned off and the patient's CVP
remained in the 12 to 16 mm range. The patient was subsequently
transferred to the floor where she did well. The patient was
biopsied twice prior to discharge , both times demonstrating no
rejection. Of note , the patient appeared to develop Cyclosporin
toxicity early in her post-operative course with rapidly rising
creatinine levels and elevated liver function tests. The patient
was placed on Trental 800 mg p.o. t.i.d. and subsequently given a
seven day course of OKT3 after which time the patient was restarted
on her Cyclosporin with no ill effect. The patient was noted to
have a left sided pleural effusion that was tapped approximately
two and a half weeks into the patient's post-operative period. 400
cc of pleural fluid was removed which grew no bacteria out. The
patient's effusion was followed by chest X-Ray and was noted again
to reaccumulate. Approximately one and a half weeks later , a chest
tube was placed with the recovery of approximately 700 cc of fluid.
This was done with ultrasound guidance. The chest tube remained in
place approximately five days and was subsequently removed. A
residual small left pneumothorax was noted. This pneumothorax was
unchanged over the ensuing three days after chest tube removal and
the patient was discharged home with a stable small left
pneumothorax.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Patient is discharged home on
Dapsone 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Cyclosporin 225 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Imuran 25 mg p.o. q.d. , Magnesium Gluconate 1 gram q.i.d. ,
Procardia XL 90 mg p.o. q.d. , Trental 800 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,

Discharge Date: 9/21/2005
ATTENDING: VAL YAFAIE M.D.
This discharge summary covers admission 7/30/05 until 9/26/05
PRIMARY ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
OTHER MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS: Familial cardiomyopathy.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old
man with familial cardiomyopathy and a last ejection fraction of
50% well known to the heart failure service secondary to multiple
admissions for decompensated CHF in the setting of poor medical
and dietary compliance presents with gradual fatigue and
increasing abdominal girth , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , and feeling ""fluid overloaded."" He denies any chest
pain , fevers , chills , or other symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Familial cardiomyopathy , history of an
AICD placed in 2001 , last ejection fraction of 50% with a
biventricular pacing , and severe mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 , Isordil 30 t.i.d. ,
spironolactone 25 b.i.d. , torsemide 200 p.o. b.i.d. , K-Dur 20
once a day , and folate 5 once a day.
ALLERGIES: ACE inhibitors cause a cough and rash and lisinopril
causes cough.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient smoked 2 packs per day times
approximately 10 years and drinks occasional ethanol. He denies
any history of other drug use. He is married and is with 2
children. He does not work currently secondary to his
cardiomyopathy. He also has a brother who is status post cardiac
transplant.
EXAMINATON DATA: Temperature 96 , Pulse 97 , blood pressure 90/70 ,
and oxygen saturation 97 on room air. Admission weight 83.8
kilograms. JVP was greater than the angle of the jaw. Cardiac
exam was regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic murmur at the
apex. Respiratory exam showed a few bibasilar rales. Abdomen
was distended with mild shifting dullness. There was trace
bilateral extremity edema.
LABORATORY VALUES: Creatinine 1.5 , sodium 129 , potassium 2.7 ,
magnesium 2.2 , ALT 32 , AST 31 , hematocrit 40.6 , white blood cell
count 7.3 , platelets 281 , INR 1.2 , PTT 35.4 , and BNP 594.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT: This is a 36-year-old man with familial
cardiomyopathy admitted for CHF exacerbation.
Problem#1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted in
decompensated failure. He reports compliance with his
medications; however , likely some component of this
decompensation is secondary to dietary indiscretion with foods
and fluids. The patient was diuresed during his hospital stay
initially with intravenous torsemide; however , this was
unsuccessful and a Lasix drip with BNP drip was started on
hospital day #3. He reached a total weight loss of approximately
2 to 3 kilograms and was converted to oral medicines including
torsemide. Moreover , he failed to maintain a stable weight on
this regimen and ultrafiltration was attempted. That removed
approximately 900 cc of fluids. This failed secondary to
intravenous access clotting and the patient's frustration with
having to lying still. The patient was subsequently converted to
oral torsemide and metolazone , torsemide 200 b.i.d. , metolazone 5
b.i.d. , and spironolactone 25 b.i.d. as an oral regimen. Per the
patient's request and reaching a somewhat adequate goal with this
hospitalization , the patient requested to be discharged. He
reported that he would follow up with the CHF nursing staff and
with Dr. Adamski and although we repeatedly stressed the importance
of free water restriction and fluid restriction , he continued to
be noncompliant with this while inhouse. At the time the patient
was discharged , it was felt that he was not optimal
hemodynamically , but had excellent followup plans and stated that
he would return if his condition worsened.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 once a day , Isordil 10
t.i.d. metolazone 5 b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 b.i.d. , torsemide
200 b.i.d. , and K-Dur 60 b.i.d.
There are no pending studies at the time of discharge. The
patient will follow up with the CHF nurse in approximately 2 days
and see Dr. Weyhrauch in clinic within 1 week.

Discharge Date: 5/10/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. AORTIC STENOSIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 55-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery
disease , congestive heart failure and chronic renal insufficiency
who presented with substernal chest pain on April , 2002 to the
Devill Medical Center .  She was admitted by the
emergency department to the Cardiology Service and work-up revealed
aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , peripheral
vascular disease , bilateral lower extremity
claudication , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
hypercholesterolemia , renal failure after her catheterization in
2001 with her creatinine running in the high 2.0 to 3.0 range ,
congestive heart failure. The patient has had a previous stent to
the LAD and circumflex in 1999. She has also had a myocardial
infarction in 1998 associated with prolonged chest pain and has a
history of class 3 angina and class 3 heart failure.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to intravenous dye. She
developed renal failure to this. She has no other
known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , amlodipine
10 mg p.o. q. day , Isordil 30 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , Lasix 160 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH
insulin 20 units q. PM and 40 units q. AM , Epogen 2 , 000 q. day and
Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is a well-developed ,
well-nourished female in no acute distress.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended. EXTREMITIES: She had
bilateral varicosities and she is status post amputations of two
toes. Her pulses to her lower extremities were intact , but faint.
LABORATORY: Cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% circumflex
lesion , 100% right coronary artery occlusion and the
circumflex was subsequently stented. An echocardiogram performed
showed a 40% ejection fraction with aortic stenosis , a peak
gradient of 35 and a calculated valve area of 1 cm squared.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
August , 2002 for an aortic valve replacement
with a St. Jude #23 mechanical valve and a coronary artery bypass
grafting x 3 to the LAD , obtuse marginal and LVB1. The patient
tolerated this procedure well and was transferred to the intensive
care unit for close monitoring. However , the patient did develop
an uncontrolled left-sided nose bleed in the operating room and ENT
was called to pack the nose. The postoperative course was
remarkable for sluggish urine output for which Renal consult was
called in to follow. The patient was treated with diuretics and
her urine output subsequently improved. The patient was kept on
pressors and mechanical ventilation for several days and was then
extubated on January , 2002 after her volume overload was
controlled. The patient was transferred to the floor on July ,
2002 off her torsemide drip and tolerating intravenous intermittent
doses of torsemide. Otolaryngology removed the packing from the
patient's nose and she just had minor oozing after this not
requiring any treatment. Both Cardiology and Renal continued to
follow throughout the patient's hospital course and by May ,
2002 , the patient was tolerating a regular diet , urinating well
with oral antidiuretics and without subsequent nose bleeds. It was
decided that the patient was ready to be discharged to
rehabilitation at this point.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Tylenol , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day ,
Dulcolax and Colace p.r.n. , Epogen
10 , 000 units subcutaneously q. week , Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH

Coumadin p.o. q. day and she should have her Coumadin adjusted
according to her INR , simvastatin and Nexium.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in good
condition.
FOLLOW UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Dulin in six
weeks. Prior to this , she should follow up with her
primary care physician within one week and her cardiologist within
one to three weeks. Ohacli Hospital Medical Center is aware of
the plans and is helping in arranging follow up appointments.

Discharge Date: 3/18/2007
ATTENDING: ADIL , ERIC MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: COPD exacerbation.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Include pneumonia , acute renal failure and
hyperkalemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly this is a 60-year-old
gentleman with COPD on 3 liters home O2 and a history of multiple
past intubations to his noncompliant with his home oxygen therapy
and chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
approximately 2 , coronary artery disease status post end-stomy ,
diastolic heart failure who presented to the Emergency Department
with shortness of breath , chest tightness and wheezing times
several days. He also complained of a productive cough and was
found to have a room air oxygen saturation of 82% that improved
to the mid 90s on nonrebreather. He was admitted to the ICU
where he was started on BiPAP and given prednisone and nebulizer
treatments. Chest x-ray identified a right middle lobe
infiltrate and the patient was placed on vancomycin , levofloxacin
and ceftazidime. Ceftazidime was later discontinued. He was
quickly weaned to 5 liters nasal cannula. An ABG checked on
admission showed partial CO2 of 60 which is the patient's
baseline. He was also found to be on acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 4.9 that improved with gentle fluids. Potassium
was elevated at 6.4 and the patient did undergo a single run of
hemodialysis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD , coronary artery disease status post
end-stomy , diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency , hyperlipidemia
and gout.
HOME MEDICATIONS: Include aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , Norvasc 10
mg p.o. daily , Toprol 100 mg p.o. daily , Avapro 150 mg p.o.
daily , Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily , Lipitor 40 mg p.o. nightly , TriCor
48 mg p.o. daily , NPH 55 units in the morning , 34 units in the
evening , NovoLog 8 units q.a.c. , allopurinol 300 mg p.o. daily ,
Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily , albuterol 2 puffs p.r.n. , Combivent
p.r.n. , Advair 500/50 b.i.d. , multivitamin once per day , folate 1
mg p.o. daily and loratadine 10 mg p.o. daily.
ALLERGIES: There are no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: A 30-pack-year history of smoking , history of
current alcohol use , five drinks per day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On transfer to the floor temperature is
96 , pulse 82 , blood pressure 150/72 , respiratory rate is 24 ,
oxygen saturation 94% on 5 liters nasal cannula. He is in no
apparent distress. Heart is regular rate and rhythm without
murmurs , rubs or gallops. He has good air movement but
expiratory wheezes and prolonged expiratory phase. There are no
rales. His abdomen is soft , obese , nontender and bowel sounds
are present. There is 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission to the floor , BUN 211 , creatinine
3.5 , potassium 4.4. White count 13.4 , hematocrit 25.8 , platelets
492 and INR 1.3. Microbiology , numerous blood , sputum and urine
cultures are negative. Studies and echocardiogram from 7/21
shows an EF of 55-60% with no regional wall abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: This is a 60-year-old gentleman admitted for a COPD
exacerbation in the setting of likely pneumonia with acute on
chronic renal failure and hyperkalemia that has resolved since
his admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Pulmonary: The patient was kept on prednisone 60 mg p.o.
daily for the first several days of his floor admission and he
was continued on DuoNeb q.6 h. , albuterol labs were added q.6 h.
staggered with DuoNeb such that he was receiving nebulizer
treatments every three hours. He was continued on chest PT. The
patient was started on CPAP overnight for history of obstructive
sleep apnea. He had not been compliant with CPAP as an
outpatient. Advair was continued. The patient did well with
this regimen and his oxygen requirements were titrated from 5
liters to 2.5 liters at the time of discharge. At this level of
oxygen he was satting in the low to mid 90s with ambulatory sat
of approximately 90%. The importance of continuing use of home
oxygen both during the day and at night was discussed at length
with the patient , though he continued to complain that he had
difficulty going about his daily activities wearing his oxygen. Prednisone
was slowly tapered and at the time of discharge the patient was
taking 40 mg of prednisone per day. He will take 20 mg starting
the first day after his discharge and will complete a slow
approximately 2-week taper. His home dose of Lasix was
continued. The patient was not felt to be clinically volume
overloaded. However , he auto-diuresed 1-2 liters the majority
of the days he was admitted to the floor. Followup was arranged
with the patient's primary care provider and his pulmonologist
Dr. Gering . The possibility of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation
was discussed at length with the patient and his wife who were
extremely resistant to any other inpatient care. He is therefore
discharged with home VNA , though the possibility of inpatient vs outpatient
pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered at his followup.
2. Renal: The patient's creatinine trended down throughout his
time on the floor. This happened in the setting of continued
auto-diuresis , suggesting that his initial renal failure was due
to a low flow state as result of heart failure rather than
hypovolemia. At the time of discharge his creatinine was 1.3.
He was followed by the Renal Team during his admission. His ARB
was initially held but then restarted upon improvement of his
creatinine. Per renal , his elevated BUN in the range of 200 was
felt to be secondary to steroid use. This had normalized by the
time of discharge. The patient was worked up for a possible AV
fistula or graft placement in the left upper extremity in the
near future. He will follow up with vascular surgery as an
outpatient for vein mapping as an outpatient. He should not receive blood
draws in the left upper extremity of avoidable.
3. Infectious disease: The patient was continued on vancomycin
and Levaquin for a seven-day course. He completed this course
during this hospitalization and he discharged off antibiotics.
All cultures were no growth at the time of discharge.
4. Cardiovascular: He was continued on aspirin and
anti-lipidemics. His Lopressor was titrated for hypertension and
he is discharged on 300 mg of Toprol per day the rest of his
antihypertensive medicines have not changed. He was kept on tele
during his admission and did have occasional episodes of NSVT
usually triplets or couplets. These were asymptomatic.
5. Endocrine: Mr. Vitro insulin requirements increased
dramatically during his ICU admission , likely as a result of
steroid use and stress. His insulin requirements fell to their
preadmission levels during his admission on the floor.
6. Prophylaxis: He was maintained on heparin and proton pump
inhibitor.
CODE STATUS: The patient is full code.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: He is in no apparent distress.
Heart , regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs or gallops.
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes ,
rales or rhonchi. Abdomen is soft , obese , nontender , bowel
sounds are present. He has trace peripheral edema bilaterally.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Please see remainder of discharge
paperwork.
DISPOSITION: To home with VNA. He should follow up with both
his primary care doctor and pulmonologist. These appointments
have been arranged for him.

Discharge Date: 3/10/1997
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: MITRAL STENOSIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Grief is a 74 year old black
female with a history of rheumatic
heart disease and history of atrial fibrillation who was
transferred from an outside hospital for treatment of her
symptomatic mitral valve stenosis. For the past two years , Ms.
Va had experienced a steady very gradual decline in her
exercise tolerance with a decreased ability to make her bed or
vacuum. However , she noticed this only in retrospect. On
6/4/97 , she presented to an outside hospital complaining of the
abrupt onset over one day of weakness , shortness of breath , 1/10
chest pain radiating to bilateral elbows , and dizziness. Symptoms
occurred at rest and were not positional and there were no
relieving or aggravating signs. They lasted approximately nine
hours resolving in the Emergency Department at the outside hospital
before therapy was initiated. Chest x-ray at this time showed mild
congestive heart failure which responded to Lasix 20 mg intravenous
push in the Emergency Department. She was admitted , ruled out for
a myocardial infarction with CK of 31 , 67 , 64 , and 59 , and sent to
catheterization on 3/8/97 which showed a left ostia at 30% , 25 mm
mitral valve gradient , pulmonary artery pressure of 8 , wedge of 18 ,
and cardiac output of 5.3. Echo revealed right and left atrial
enlargement , mild mitral regurgitation , mild tricuspid
regurgitation , ejection fraction was 60% to 65% , and mitral
stenosis with a mitral valve area of 0.9 cm squared down from 1.2
cm squared in 6/10 .  Ms. Sakovitch remained at this outside hospital
for one week essentially symptom free on bedrest and medical
management while awaiting transfer for definitive treatment at the
Ni Rise University Hospitals Of .  She was transferred to the Theay Hospital on the evening of 6/25/97 in good condition
and remained symptom free on bedrest. She complained of no
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , hemoptysis , fever , chills ,
nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or change in bowel or bladder habits.
Her cardiac risk factors included hypercholesterolemia ,
hypertension , she was not diabetic , did not smoke , and had a plus
or minus family history with a sister who died at 68 of a cardiac
arrest.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for rheumatic heart disease
without a history of rheumatic fever that
was diagnosed in 1994 , she had atrial fibrillation , she ruled out
for myocardial infarction in 6/10 and again prior to admission at
the outside hospital , she had a normal exercise tolerance test in
4/16 , submaximal full without anginal symptoms at baseline , she
had a history of peptic ulcer disease , a hiatal hernia , peripheral
vascular disease , and chronic bronchitis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for a left saphenous ligation.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Zocor 10
mg p.o. q.d. , isosorbide 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Coumadin 5 mg q.d. and 2.5 mg Thursday , and Lanoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
ALLERGIES: She was allergic to penicillin which gave her a rash
and to Darvocet which gave her dysphoria.
FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: Essentially noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a moderately obese white female
comfortable in bed with a heart rate of 56
and 94 , respiratory rate of 18 , blood pressure of 110-130/70-80 ,
and temperature 98.1. HEENT: Examination was essentially
unremarkable , carotids were 2+ with good upstrokes and no bruits ,
jugular venous pressure was 7 cm , pupils equally round and reactive
to light , extraocular movements intact , cranial nerves intact
bilaterally , supple neck with no lymphadenopathy , and notable for

1. Ventral hernia containing nonobstructive transverse colon.
2. Nonspecific low-attenuation segment VII hepatic lesion
3. Oral contrast remains in the stomach.
KUB postcontrast: Oral contrast from the CT abdomen and pelvis
remains in the stomach suggesting possibility of gastric atony
versus outlet obstruction.
EGD: Hypomotility of the stomach , no ulcerations , biopsies
taken. Normal pylorus and normal duodenum.
KUB post-EGD: No free air or obstruction.
Gastric emptying study: Mildly delayed emptying , no reflux.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 80 , normal axis and intervals , right
bundle-branch block , no ST or T-wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: Following several studies in the
emergency department as well as consultations from the
gastroenterologist and the general surgeons , the patient was
thought to have abdominal pain secondary to gastroparesis given
the findings on the EGD and CT as well as the negative ultrasound
and KUB. The gastroparesis was thought to be secondary to his
diabetes. He was admitted to the medical service and his diet
was slowly increased. On the floor , his pain continued , and
within two to three days , he began spiking fevers to 101 to 102.
He had a repeat abdominal CT , which showed a distended
gallbladder with circumferential wall thickening and extensive
stranding of the pericholecystic fat , which represented acute
acalculous cholecystitis. Surgery was reconsulted , and the
patient was taken to the operating room where he had an
exploratory laparoscopy , which was then converted to an open
cholecystectomy for gangrenous cholecystitis. The patient
received perioperative vancomycin , Levaquin , and Flagyl and
continued to do well post surgery with advancement of his diet
and decrease in his pain medication requirement. Vancomycin was
discontinued on 4/14/2006 after six days of vancomycin. He was
continued on the Levaquin and Flagyl. He had a drain that was
left in following surgery , and this was pulled on 4/14/2006 .
Following the pulling of the drain , he developed leakage of
green-tinged serous fluid from his abdominal wound. An abdominal
CT was done which showed a small fluid collection and no abscess.
An ERCP was done which showed a cystic duct stump bile leak.
They did a biliary sphincterotomy and stenting with no further
leak. The patient was continued on empiric Levaquin and Flagyl
following the procedure. His diet was advanced and he tolerated
this well. He had no further pain. He is being discharged on a
total of seven days of Levaquin and Flagyl following the bile
leak.
Endocrine: The patient was continued on lower-dose insulin while
he was n.p.o. and this was titrated up as his diet increased.
Cardiovascular: The patient was followed by the cardiac
transplant team. He was initially switched to IV cyclosporine
and his CellCept was held. These were transitioned to p.o. and
restarted following his improvement. Postoperatively , he got
stress-dose hydrocortisone instead of his prednisone and this was
then tapered to Solu-Medrol and then back to prednisone at his
home dose. He was fluid overloaded following the surgery. He
got 100 of IV Lasix times several doses , and then restarted on
his torsemide to maintain euvolemia. His Cartia was initially
discontinued for a question of contribution to gastroparesis , but
this was then restarted. He was discharged on all his home
medications with the torsemide at a dose of 40 mg q.a.m.
Rheumatology: Following his surgery , he developed bilateral
elbow pain , which was thought to be likely secondary to gout.
The rheumatology service was consulted. A left elbow tap was
attempted , but this did not return any fluid. He was given
several doses of colchicine p.r.n. with improvement. The steroid
taper was slowed and his gout improved. He was discharged
without any elbow pain.
Phlebitis: He developed left arm phlebitis secondary to an
infiltrating IV. This was covered by his antibiotics that were
started for his cholecystitis and his arm improved.
FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The patient will follow up with the cardiac transplant
service. This will be arranged by them.
2. The patient will need to follow up with Dr. Magdefrau from
general surgery ( 800-336-8213 ) to have his staples removed in two
weeks.
3. The patient will need to follow up with Dr. Vinion from
gastroenterology to schedule an appointment to have his stents
removed in six weeks.
4. The patient will continue to take his cardiac medications as
before. His torsemide is dosed now at 40 mg q.a.m.
5. The patient will continue on Levaquin and Flagyl as
prescribed for five days following discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg daily.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HEART FAILURE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY.
2. VALVULAR CARDIOMYOPATHY.
3. MITRAL REGURGITATION.
4. TRICUSPID REGURGITATION.
5. HYPERTENSION.
6. HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA.
7. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50-year-old man with
valvular cardiomyopathy , status post
three aortic valve replacements , who presents with no acute
complaints but a progressive decline in daily function.
Mr. Kozub history begins in 9/13 when he presented with
shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea in the
setting of medications ( Lasix and/or Procardia for hypertension )
noncompliance. He was found by echo to have severe aortic
insufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation , left ventricular
hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 45%. He subsequently
underwent aortic valve replacement along with a mitral valve
repair. Aortic valve pathology showed myxomatous degeneration.
One month post-surgery , he required repeat aortic valve replacement
with dehiscence and was documented to have an annular abscess with
cultures positive for yeast , for which he was treated with
amphotericin-B , vancomycin and gentamicin. At this time , he also
required coronary artery reimplantation and annular repair. This
hospital course was additionally complicated by development of
third degree heart block necessitating the implantation of a
permanent pacemaker. After discharge , Mr. Buzo did generally
well for the following years until 9/4 , when he again presented
with increasing shortness of breath. Echo then revealed moderate
to severe aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac catheterization showed clear coronary arteries. At this
time , his aortic valve was again replaced with a St. Jude's valve.
Again , following discharge , Mr. Kock did generally well until
4/19 when again he presented with shortness of breath. At that
time , echo showed at least mild perivalvular aortic regurgitation
with left ventricular dilatation ( The systolic diameter of 6.1 cm ) ,
along with 1+ mitral regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , and
an ejection fraction of 15-20%. Stress testing at this time showed
a physical work capacity of 15.1. It is not documented what was
done at this time , but apparently his Lasix was increased from
40 mg b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d. with good effect. Regarding this
admission , Mr. Bessemer reports that he has been feeling fine and is
here in the hospital because his doctors want to replace his valve ,
or if that doesn't work as it hasn't the last three times , to give
him a new heart all together. He reports no increasing dyspnea ,
fatigue , ankle edema or abdominal girth. He sleeps on three
pillows at night and has not recently been short of breath when
lying flat. He is able to do chores around the house without
getting short of breath , but usually does get short of breath after
one flight of stairs. He doesn't complain of significant
disability or quality of life impairment as a result of his heart
condition. He notes that he has not been able to participate in
the marching band over the last year , but that he can play sitting
down. Mr. Lonn attributes his disease to having been
noncompliant with his Procardia following the cerebrovascular
accident in 1993. He says that , ""He brought on his heart problems
himself.""
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Otherwise , notable for an embolism to his
left foot in 1998 as a result of having
stopped Coumadin therapy , chronic renal insufficiency with
creatinine ranging from 1.4-2.2 in 2/12 , and he is status post
exploratory laparotomy in 1960 from a gunshot wound.
ALLERGIES: He is allergic to Zestril , which gives him perioral
angioedema.
MEDICATIONS: Lasix 80 mg b.i.d , atenolol 50 mg q.d. , Avapro
150 mg q.d. , Coumadin 5 mg q.d. , Zantac 150 mg
b.i.d. , Niferex 150 mg q.d.
FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is negative for heart disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 35 pack-year smoking history , but quit
one year ago. He has occasional alcohol use.
Mr. Allegrini is on permanent disability leave from his job at
Des Jack Oxall , which involved a lot of heavy lifting. He lives at home
with his wife and 19-year-old son , and spends most of his day
there. He is active in Naomin Me Yonkers , where he likes to play the base
drum.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: He is a thin , healthy-appearing
black man in no apparent distress. VITAL
SIGNS: Heart rate 65 , blood pressure 120/70 , oxygen saturation 98%
on room air. NECK: His carotid pulses variance and normal in
volume. Jugular venous pressure 7 cm. LUNGS: Clear. His PMI is
vibratory in quality and prominent , lateral to the anterior
axillary line. He has a normal S1 , an ejection sound , and a loud
prosthetic S2 , a III/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal
border , and a III/IV holodiastolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border radiating to the right upper sternal border. ABDOMEN:
Non-distended , with no organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: Warm with faint
pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Remarkable for a creatinine of 2.3 , hematocrit
33.5 , with a MCV of 83.5 , RDW of 28.8 ,
reticulocyte count of 6.6 and LDH of 1077. Mr. Shadler had an echo
here that showed severe aortic insufficiency with a severely
dilated left ventricle ( and diastolic diameter of 7.0 and systolic
diameter of 6.3 ) , as well as mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 20-25%. Exercise testing
showed an oxygen uptake of 12.7. On cath , his pulmonary artery
pressure , wedge pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance was
47/16 , 13 and 379 , which fell to 26/4 , 5 , and 137 , respectively
with Nipride. His systemic vascular resistance was markedly
elevated at 2400 and a thick cardiac output and cardiac index were
3.62 and 2.31. Amlodipine was then started and Lasix was increased
in an effort to reduce his systemic vascular resistance and
pulmonary wedge pressure. The remainder of the transplant workup
results were unremarkable except for a significantly reduced
diffusing capacity of 59% corrected , a creatinine clearance of 48.4
and a prostate specific antigen of 18.1. Prostate biopsy and bone
scan were both negative. His admission was otherwise notable for
an elevated creatinine to 3.0 in the setting of perioperative
levofloxacin and gentamicin , as well as aggressive vasodilator
therapy. He was allowed to drift back down to his baseline of low
2's before discharge.
Mr. Krough was discharged home in stable condition on the following
medications:
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Lasix 120 mg b.i.d. ,
Coumadin 5 mg q.d. , amlodipine 2.5 mg q.d. ,
Avapro 150 mg q.d. , Niferex 150 mg q.d. , ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: He will follow-up with Dr. Lon Poat in
two weeks.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 53 year old , white male
with insulin dependent , adult onset
diabetes mellitus , past alcohol abuse , cardiomyopathy , congestive
heart failure , and seizure disorder , who has been relatively
disabled due to shortness of breath , since 1992. The patient was
at home on the day of admission when he noted difficulty lighting a
cigarette with his right hand , as well as keeping it in his mouth.
The patient had difficulty speaking and his arm became
progressively weaker over the next several hours. The patient was
able to eat and drink with some difficulty. He noted word finding
difficulty , dysarthria , and arm weakness. The patient denied
headache , visual problems , loss of sensation , loss of
consciousness , urinary symptoms , diplopia , vertigo , nausea ,
vomiting , or difficulty ambulating. The patient was brought to the
Emergency Room by his son when his symptoms continued to worsen.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is significant for
alcoholism , cardiomyopathy , congestive heart
failure , coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction ,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by focal motor
seizures with hyperglycemia , deep venous thrombosis , venostasis
ulcers , cellulitis , diabetic retinopathy , idiopathic eosinophilia ,
asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , gout ,
hepatosplenomegaly , and ascites.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Medications on admission include
hydroxyurea 500 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q day , insulin
NPH 30 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. , Indocin 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
p.r.n. gout , and Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day.
ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to Penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: His social history is notable for occasional
alcohol use. Of note , his last use of alcohol was
one week prior to admission. The patient had previously used
alcohol quite seriously , with one case of beer q day times 33
years , quitting heavy alcohol use after his myocardial infarction.
The patient smokes tobacco one pack per day. He used cocaine for
three years but quit cocaine use three years prior to admission.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Review of systems is notable for very poor
exercise tolerance with a one block maximum
limit. The patient stops due to shortness of breath and
claudication. He also has two pillow orthopnea.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a pleasant , obese , middle aged ,
53 year old , white male with a right facial
droop and in no acute distress. Temperature is 97 , pulse 84 , blood
pressure 126/70 , and O2 saturation is 99 percent on room air. His
heent examination was notable for no nystagmus and no diplopia.
His tongue was deviated to the right. His neck was supple with a
full range of motion. He had no bruits or lymphadenopathy. His
cardiac examination revealed tachycardia , regular rate and rhythm ,
S1 and S2 , and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard loudest at the
axilla. His lung examination showed fine crackles at the left base
with diffuse wheezes. His abdomen was obese , soft , distended , and
non-tender. He had normoactive bowel sounds and liver span of 15
cm. His extremity examination was notable for chronic venostasis
changes , right greater than left , with 1+ peripheral pulses. His
neurological examination was notable for his being alert and
oriented times three. His ability to name was intact but he had
word finding difficulty. He had no right and left confusion. He
had downward droop of his right nasolabial fold , as well as a right
oral droop and a central seventh deficit. His tongue showed right
deviation. His sensory ability was intact overall. He had
decreased motor tone in his right upper extremity with 4/5 strength
in his right arm. His right arm lacked coordination and he had
difficulty initiating movement with his right arm but his strength
was still 4/5. His left upper extremity was 5/5 strength with good
coordination. His lower extremities were both 5/5.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium was 140 , potassium 4.8 , chloride 104 ,
bicarbonate 19 , BUN 44 , creatinine 1.6 , and
glucose was 164. White count was 11 , 000 , hematocrit 43.3 , and
platelet count was 163 , 000. PT was 14.1 , INR 1.4 , PTT 29.1.
Urinalysis showed 20 to 25 hyaline casts with 3-5 red blood cells.
There were no white blood cells.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Service
with a presumptive diagnosis of a left sided
stroke. A head CT was performed on hospital day number one but was
negative with no evidence of cerebral infarct or bleeding.
However , a follow up head CT on hospital day number three
demonstrated acute infarct in the left insular capsule and left
corona radiata. A carotid ultrasound was obtained on hospital day
number five which demonstrated bilateral carotid plaques with less
than 50 percent stenosis of both carotid arteries. Because of the
patient's history of diabetes and his cardiac history , especially
given his prior myocardial infarction , the patient was placed on a
ROMI protocol. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction
and he was given a cardiac echocardiogram on hospital day number
two. The echocardiogram demonstrated increased left ventricular
size with preserved systolic function and an ejection fraction of
65 percent. He had dilated left and right atria and he had
thickened mitral valve leaflets with 4+ mitral regurgitation , with
flow reversible into his pulmonary veins. He also had 3 to 4+
tricuspid regurgitation with slow reversal into the vena cava. He
had a trileaflet aortic valve with mild sclerosis but no
insufficiency or stenosis. He also had increased right heart size
with right heart pressures of 55 to 60 mm of mercury. He was noted
to have a trivial pericardial effusion. Of note , there was no
evidence of any thrombus in the heart. However , because of the
nature of his stroke , which was felt to be embolic by neurology , as
well as his enlarged atria. The patient was placed on IV Heparin
and he was then started on oral Coumadin for long-term
anticoagulation. The patient did very well after his stroke and
his original slurred speech improved markedly over the course of
his admission. He also regained full strength in his right arm ,
although he continued to have some decreased coordination in that
arm. The patient also demonstrated inability to swallow without
difficulty and an esophagogram with video analysis was performed on
hospital day number six , prior to his discharge. The video study
of his swallowing demonstrated that he had essentially normal
swallowing and he was cleared to go home on a regular diet. Of
note , his blood pressure tended to be low , around 100 to 110
systolic , while in the hospital , so his Lisinopril was discontinued
and he was given instructions that Lisinopril would be restarted by
his CMC attending after his discharge. His hydroxyurea was
increased from 500 mg to 1 gram q day. The patient did quite well
after his stroke and he was discharged home with services on
April , 1995.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: His discharge medications were
Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 40
mg p.o. q day , insulin NPH 30 units subcutaneous q.a.m. and 20
units subcutaneous q.p.m. , Atrovent inhaler two puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.
wheezing , multivitamins one capsule p.o. q day , Coumadin 4 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , and Indocin 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. gout pain.
DISPOSITION: DIET: The patient is on an ADA 1800 calorie diet.
ACTIVITY: He has no activity restrictions.

5. Endocrine
6. Pain
7. Psychiatric
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of multiple
myeloma , and worsening BPH ( benign prostatic hypertrophy ) ,
requiring a Foley. The patient was seen in Randuke Hospital on the day of admission and was noted to have a
hematocrit drop from the 37 range to 28.5 along with hypotension
and an increasing creatinine rising from 1.2-2.3 in one week's
time.
The patient was noted to have recently significantly increasing
lower extremity edema. He reports that over a 3-4 day period , he
went from having almost no edema to having very large legs , which
he describes ""tree trunks."" The patient reports that these were
painful at first , but are no longer painful. He reports that
they were always symmetric. The patient reports no prior history
of CHF ( congestive heart failure ) , or any severe cardiac
problems , which he is aware , but does report having heart attack
at 27 years old. The patient did not know the details of these
cardiac events at 27 years old , and has received minimal followup
for this issue. He does report that he was intermittently seen
by a cardiologist , and had a normal catheterization four years
ago. He reports he has never had an echocardiogram.
The patient also reports an episode of 30-minute chest tightness
the day prior to admission while he was having a Foley catheter
placed. The patient did not tell anyone about this at that time ,
and this pain desisted on its own. The pain was described as
substernal burning pain , with no left arm pain , no jaw pain , no
shortness of breath or diaphoresis , and no nausea or vomiting.
The patient has had no orthopnea or PND.
The patient has had a recent history increasingly worsening BPH.
The patient has a 15-year history of BPH , and is followed by Dr.
Tod Cutshall at Kernmilf Nadrock Hospital And Health Center .  The patient was
recently admitted to SHHC for anuria , had a cystoscopy , clot
evacuation and was discharged on 7/24/05 with a Foley in place.
The patient followed up with Dr. Queen on 10/21/05 , had his
Foley removed , but failed this trial and he represented to an
outside hospital with clots and anuria. The patient's bladder
was irrigated and the Foley was replaced. He reports that he has
been passing clots but that he has been passing urine. The
patient also reports that his urine while having clots at times ,
is mostly clear and yellow , and that he continually makes urine
and has to replace the Foley bag.

BRIEF PHYSICAL EXAM:
Vital signs: Temperature 96.5 , pulse 70 , blood pressure 100/62 ,
respiratory rate 20 and the patient is satting 95% on room air.
General: The patient is alert , oriented , in no acute distress ,
and is not ill appearing. HEENT: Normocephalic , atraumatic ,
oropharynx is clear. No lesions or ulcers. No lymphadenopathy.
Anicteric sclerae. Cardiovascular , has JVP elevated to the angle
of the jaw. Regular rate and rhythm , with frequent premature
beat. No S3 or S4 appreciated. Pulmonary: A few crackles at
the left base otherwise clear to auscultation. Abdomen: Soft ,
nontender , bowel sounds present and normoactive. No
hepatosplenomegaly , no frank dullness. Extremities: 2-3+
pitting edema to the knees , symmetric bilaterally , shins
lukewarm. Strength 5/5 throughout in upper and lower
extremities. Neurological: The patient is alert and oriented
x3 , has normal affect. Reflexes in the biceps , patellar , and
Achilles tendons are equal bilaterally. Sensation grossly intact
on upper and lower extremities.
PERTINENT LABORATORY RESULTS:
On admission , the patient's white blood cell count was 7.2 , his
hematocrit was 28.5 , down from 37 one week previously. The
patient's platelet count was 238 , 000. The patient's chem-7 was
unremarkable with the exception of a creatinine of 2.3 , up from a
baseline of 1.2-1.4 over one week's time. The patient had a BNP
checked , which turned out to be 312 , elevated. The patient has
also had several recent imaging studies including renal
ultrasound on 2/6/05 , which showed multiple bilateral renal
cysts but no obstruction. An abdominal MRI was obtained on
2/20/05 , which showed small amount of ascites , an enlarged
prostate , multiple renal cysts , no other pathologies was noted.
The patient also had a CT to evaluate his ureters on 10/8/05 ,
which showed no stones in the kidneys or ureters , but an enlarged
prostate.
A cystoscopy report from 9/23/05 from a recent admission to
Ma Faulkmark Hospital showed oozing from tortuous veins in
the prostate.
The patient had an EKG , which showed first-degree block with a
left bundle branch block , and frequent PVCs. This was noted to
be present on an old examination , after consultation with an
outpatient cardiologist at Perlaw Memorial Hospital .  The patient
had a troponin I of 0.11 , slightly elevated. The patient's CK
was 136 , MB fraction 4.3 , both within normal limits. On
admission , the patient coagulation parameters showed an INR of
1.2. Other pertinent data includes an orally reported cardiac
catheterization at Beckry Hospital in 2001 , which showed no
obstructive coronary disease , but diffuse coronary artery
disease , with an ejection fraction of 50%. An adenosine MIBI
obtained in 2002 at Peacepe Planthugh Memorial Medical Center showed possible old
inferior infarct , global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of
35-40%. An echocardiogram obtained during this admission
demonstrated the patient's EF at this point to be 25% , rather
with global hypokinesis.
OPERATIONS OR PROCEDURES:
There were no operations or procedures performed during this
admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
Cardiovascular - the patient was determined initially to be
likely in congestive heart failure , with elevated neck veins , and
increased leg edema and a low blood pressure. Because the
patient was determined to be in CHF , he was diuresed with IV
Lasix , and later with p.o. Lasix , the patient was diuresed
approximately 2 liters per day over a 4-5 period. The patient's
blood pressure subsequently rose. After consultation with
Cardiology , it was determined that a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor should be added to the patient's medication regimen as
his blood pressure would allow , for demonstrated benefit and
congestive heart failure.
Because the patient was initially determined to have some risk of
myocardial infarction , had reported chest pain the day prior to
admission , and had slightly elevated troponins. The patient's
troponin and CK-MB were followed until they began decreasing. It
is likely that these very small elevations were due to small
amount of ischemia from demand , due to the patient's fluid
overload and anemia. The patient was continued on his statin
medication.
The patient on admission had frequent PVCs , and some short runs
of ventricular tachycardia lasting less than 5 beats. After
diuresis , the patient had no further runs of VT , and had only
minimal ectopy. The patient's electrolytes including potassium
and magnesium were checked daily and repleted as necessary.
Aspirin was withheld from the patient for now , despite having a
benefit in cardiac disease of this kind. This is because the
patient's hematocrit was low and he had recently had bleeding
likely from his bladder. Urology Department was consulted
regarding this decision.
Renal/genitourinary: The patient has a long known history of BPH
and is followed closely at Cotson Tionlo Hospital by Dr.
Josue Grefe . The patient was recently admitted for these
problems due to obstruction , and instrumentation. On admission ,
the patient's urine did not have any red blood cells , and he had
no obvious clots at any point. After consultation with Urology ,
and after the patient had been diuresing well with Lasix , the
patient's Foley catheter was removed and after this point he had
no problem with urinating. The patient was maintained on Proscar
in addition to Flomax.
Heme: The patient's hematocrit drop was likely due to two
factors. First of all , the patient is known to have been losing
blood in the form of clots from his bladder. This is likely due
to bleeding from the surface of his prostate where a recent
cystoscopy had demonstrated tortuous veins. In addition , the
reading of hematocrit of 24.5 on admission was likely secondary
to dilution , the patient was massively fluid overloaded. The
patient's hematocrit rose after diuresis , and was maintained in
the 31-32 range without transfusion during admission. He was ,
however , typed and screened , and the plan was to transfuse him
should his hematocrit decrease below 30 , given his cardiac
history.
Oncologic: The patient is followed closely by Dr. Zecchini at
Hool Norhunt General Hospital .  His most recent treatment was on
8/4/05 and his multiple myeloma seems to be responding well to
therapy. During this admission , multiple myeloma was not an
active issue. See Reb Memorial Hospital notes for more information.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes , he
takes Lantus and Novolog at home. He was continued on these
medications while as an inpatient.
Pain: The patient was offered oxycodone p.r.n. for pain. He did
not complain of any pain during admission.
Psychiatric: The patient , though pleasant and cooperative on
admission , became increasingly combative. On the night of
1/5/05 , he became very combative , and attempted to hit one of
the cross covering physicians. The patient was initially tried
on several medications to control this agitation including Ativan
and Zyprexa. These apparently were not effective at first. The
patient continued to have difficulty sleeping and was very
agitated. At one point , he would not take his medications.
Psychiatry was involved , and after much discussion with the
patient and involvement of social work , the patient did calm down
and agreed to medical care. At one point when he became
agitated , he was given Haldol intravenously , in addition to
Ativan , after being given these medications , the patient slept
very well through the night. When he awoke the next morning , his
mood was much improved , and he apologized for his behavior ,
reporting he did not know what happened. Because of the change
in mental status , several studies were obtained to investigate
this , a head CT showed no acute disease , only some bony changes
likely chronic due to multiple myeloma. In addition , the
patient's electrolytes were checked which were normal , the
patient's fingerstick blood glucose was checked which was normal.
In addition , an RPR was sent , in addition to folate and B12.
These labs were pending at the time of discharge and will be
followed up by his outpatient physicians.

KEY FEATURES OF PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE:
At the time of discharge , the patient was mentating very well ,
thinking clearly , and was pleasant and cooperative. The
remainder of the patient's exam was much improved from his
admission and his lower extremity edema had decreased to 1+ , and

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1 ) HYPOTHYROIDISM.
2 ) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
3 ) HYPERTENSION.
4 ) HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year-old woman
with a history of myocardial
infarction , atrial fibrillation , hypertension and congestive heart
failure who presents with shortness of breath.
The patient is status post inferior posterior myocardial infarction
on March , 1998. Thrombolysis was deferred secondary to severe
hypertension ( systolic blood pressure was greater than 200 ).
Catheterization revealed 80% RCA stenosis with thrombus. She
underwent PTCA and stenting and ReoPro under the Lakeni Ralton Rooson Hospital study.
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 45% , inferior
posterior lateral hypokinesis , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , 2+
mitral regurgitation , moderate aortic insufficiency. She was
treated with Ticlid for 30 days , aspirin , Lopressor , Verapamil and
Captopril. That hospital course was complicated by asymptomatic
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the setting of pneumonia and new
diagnosis of hyperthyroidism ( TSH less than assay , T4 16.1 , T3 133 ,
THBR 1.24 ). She was started on Procainamide and subsequently as an
outpatient on PTU without recurrence of atrial fibrillation. She
has been treated with Coumadin. On April , 1998 , she was admitted
for left upper extremity weakness with a question of transient
ischemic attack in the setting of subtherapeutic INR. Head CT scan
was negative and brain MRI/MRA was also negative. On September ,
1998 , she was admitted to Hillh Hospital for flash pulmonary
edema requiring intubation. She was in normal sinus rhythm , but
hypertensive. She ruled out for myocardial infarction and repeat
catheterization showed patent stent , otherwise unchanged. She was
subsequently started on Lasix and was well until the night prior to
admission when she developed gradually worsening shortness of
breath , wheezing and chest pain. Also , she had an increase in
orthopnea from one to two pillows , diaphoresis and worsening of her
baseline right shoulder pain with no edema. She had a cough
productive of scant white sputum for three days prior to admission ,
no fever or chills. In the emergency room , her blood pressure was
found to be 230/100 with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air
increasing to 95% on two liters. She had crackles one-third of the
way up her lung fields bilaterally. EKG was in normal sinus
rhythm. Chest x-ray showed edema and effusion. She improved
quickly with oxygen , nitrates and Lasix.

SOCIAL HISTORY: She immigrated from the Pa Drive , Meroesun Geworth in
1981. She lives with her daughter and has a two
pack per day smoking history times 40 years. She has no alcohol
use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , she was breathing
comfortably , supine at 30 degrees. Vital
signs: Temperature 98.4 degrees , heart rate 61 and regular , blood
pressure 153/75 , respiratory rate 18 , with an oxygen saturation 93%
on three liters. HEENT examination revealed that the sclerae were
anicteric. Pupils were equal , round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements were intact. Oropharynx was benign. Neck
revealed that the jugular venous pressure was elevated to her ear.
Carotids were 1+ on the right , 2+ on the left. There was a
question of a right carotid bruit. There was no thyromegaly.
Lungs revealed crackles half way up bilaterally , no wheezing.
Cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm with an S4 ,
intermittent S3 , no murmurs. Abdomen revealed normal active bowel
sounds , soft and non-tender , mildly distended with a pulsatile
liver. Extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. There
were 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. There was no calf
tenderness. Skin was warm and dry. Neurological examination
revealed that cranial nerves III-XII were intact. Motor was five
out of five throughout. Sensory was intact to light touch
throughout. Reflexes were 2+ bilaterally with downgoing toes.
Rectal examination was guaiac negative in the emergency room.
LABORATORY: Admission laboratory studies revealed a sodium of 140 ,
potassium 4.4 , chloride 105 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 19 ,
creatinine 0.6 , glucose 149. White blood cell count was 12.3 ,
hematocrit 38.8 , platelet count was normal. CK was 44. Troponin
was 0.03. INR was 1.8. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 90 with
old inferior Qs , left ventricular hypertrophy with strain in I and
L which were old , T-wave inversion in III and V6 as well as
pseudonormalized T-waves in V1 through V4 which are new compared
with October , 1998. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , pulmonary
vascular redistribution , Kerley B lines , but no infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Congestive heart failure: The assessment was
that the patient presented in acute congestive
heart failure , most likely due to diastolic dysfunction in the
setting of hypertension. Other contributing factors possibly
playing a role in the patient's heart failure could have included
medication non-compliance and dietary indiscretion. Another
possibility entertained was that the patient could have had
transient atrial fibrillation triggering heart failure , however all
of her EKGs showed her to be normal sinus rhythm , questioning this
possibility. The patient was diuresed with intravenous Lasix and
stabilized on p.o. Lasix during her hospital course.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction by CKs , Troponin and EKG.
2 ) Hyperthyroidism: The patient's TSA was measured to be at less
than assay on May , 1998 raising the possibility that uncontrolled
hyperthyroidism could also be contributing to her cardiac
dysfunction. An Endocrine consult was obtained with the
recommendation that her PTU be increased to 100 mg t.i.d. Her T4
and THBR were measured and found to be 8.1 and 0.91 which were
within normal limits after the increased dose of PTU. The patient
is to receive follow-up in the Thyroid Clinic for definitive
therapy , possibly iodine ablation of known thyroid nodules in her
left lobe.
3 ) Elevated white blood cell count on admission , but with a normal
differential: The patient remained afebrile throughout her
hospital course. Urinalysis was negative for infection and repeat
chest x-ray showed no infiltrate.
4 ) Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remained in the
range of 110-155/50-70s during her hospital course on Atenolol ,
Isordil and Lisinopril.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )
Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Lasix
80 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. 5 ) Lisinopril
40 mg p.o. q. day. 6 ) Procainamide SR 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. 7 ) PTU
100 mg p.o. t.i.d. 8 ) Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q. day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with VNA services
to check weights and assistance with medication.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Pastor on February ,
1998 and Dr. Rais in the Thyroid Clinic on August ,
1998.

Unit at 1:00 p.m. on the 2/17/2004 .
DISPOSITION:
The patient is to be discharged to Ant University Hospital today.
ADMISSION DATE:
The patient was admitted to Trote Hospital on
2/4/2004 and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care unit on
6/29/2004 .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
The patient was admitted to Biand Valley General Hospital with the
diagnosis of changes in mental status secondary to hypercarbia.
The patient was admitted to Medical Intensive Care Unit with
hypercarbic respiratory failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for COPD , CHF , CAD , non-insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus , renal insufficiency , chronic venostasis , cellulitis ,
obesity , gout , sleep apnea , asthma , hypertension , urinary
retention , degenerative joint disease of the right knee. The
patient is status post CABG 1999 three vessels. The patient has
an 80-pack-year smoking history. The patient is on two liters of
nasal cannula at home. The patient is full code.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a long history of
COPD who is on 2 liters of nasal cannula at home with
80-pack-year of smoking history.
Briefly , the patient is an 80-year-old gentleman who was admitted
to Astine Emount Wallca Medical Center on 2/4/2004 with drowsiness and
slurred speech. Initial ABG showed pH of 7.25 , PCO2 of 82 , PO2
of 56 , sating 87%. He quickly awakened after Narcan was
administered. Recently , he had been taking an increased amount
of opiates for pain and he was admitted with a diagnosis of
hypercarbia secondary to increased opiate intake and COPD flare.
The patient had a long history of COPD. He has an 80-pack-year
of smoking history and is normally on 2 liters of nasal cannula
at home. He was initially treated for COPD on the floor and
given gentle hydration as he also suffers chronic renal
insufficiency. He was given Percocet for pain control. The
patient appears to be improving by serial arterial blood gasses.
Had decrease in creatinine and improved mental status. At 11:00
a.m. on the 6/29/2004 the patient was found breathless and
pulseless. At that time , his ABG showed a pH of 7.04 , PCO2 of
95 , PO2 of 47 , he was sating 54%. An ACLS code was 1. The
patient received 1 mg atropine and 0.04 of Narcan. He appeared
to be aspirating when intubated. He was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit where he was until 2/17/2004 , when he was
discharged.
ALLERGIES: The patient has questionable penicillin allergies
with unknown reaction.
PERTINENT PHYSICAL EXAM:
In general , the patient is an obese Hispanic male who is sedated
and intubated. He responds to commands and is oriented to voice
on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. His skin showed
his lower extremities with changes of chronic venostasis. He had
erythema to the knees , nonpitting edema bilateral to the knees
and induration of skin on legs , medial thigh , and bilateral
popliteal fossae. His feet had onychomycosis bilaterally with no
clearcut abrasions or cuts. The rest of his skin exam was
remarkable for multiple ecchymoses , one weeping plaque on the
abdomen at heparin injection site. His right subclavian line was
nontender and nonerythematous with one leaking port. Head and
neck exam: His pupils were equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodations. His extraocular movements were intact. His
oropharynx was clear. His endotracheal tube and OG tube were in
place. His chest sounds were clear anteriorly. He had decreased
breath sounds laterally. He had isolated wheezing at the left
midclavicular line. His heart sounds , S1 and S2 were heard. His
abdomen was obese. He had a large panus , no appreciable
organomegaly , tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds.
Extremities: He was moving all four extremities spontaneously.
They were warm and perfused. Neurologically , his cranial nerves
were grossly intact. There were no focal anomalies.
On addition , the patient had a sodium of 140 , a potassium of 5.4 ,
chloride of 104 , carbon dioxide of 24 , BUN of 72 , creatinine of
2.1 , glucose of 153. She had an ionized calcium of 1.04 and
magnesium of 2.1.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Pulmonary. The patient was admitted to the MICU with
hypercarbic respiratory arrest and aspiration pneumonia per
symptoms , signs and chest x-ray. Given the history and timing of
the arrest , the patient likely was hypercarbic secondary to COPD
exacerbation , as hypercarbic arrest occurred several days in
house where opiates were not administered. It is highly
improbable that the arrest happened secondary to opiate ingestion
rather patient likely had COPD exacerbation. Also , the patient
has significant cardiac history of CHF and CAD , which may have
contributed. Subsequent chest CT on the floor demonstrated that
in addition the patient had very significant pleural effusions.
The patient was treated for aspiration pneumonia with
levofloxacin and Flagyl and aztreonam. He was also treated with
albuterol Atrovent nebulizers. Aggressive physical therapy was
also provided for the patient. The patient after completing his
antibiotic treatments for aspiration pneumonia was noted to have
MRSA growing in his sputum. He was given a 14-day course of
vancomycin as well to treat MRSA pneumonia. To help the
patient's pulmonary status , significant diuresis was attempted.
The patient was typically diuresed at 1-2 liters per day. The
aggressive diuresis was estimated to have taken in the
neighborhood of 15-20 liters of the patient and this likely
remarkably helped the patient's breathing status and his ability
to get off the ventilator. The patient had a tracheostomy and
peg placed on 8/27/04 and began breathing on trache collar on
the 6/11/04 and has been breathing until the present time
successfully on trache collar.
2. ID. The patient was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. He
was also colonized with MRSA and VSE by the end of his course.
During his initial MICU admission he was diagnosed with
vancomycin sensitive enterococcal UTI. He was treated with
antibiotics for all of these. His aspiration pneumonia was
treated with levofloxacin , aztreonam and Flagyl. Subsequent MRSA
pneumonia was treated with vancomycin. The patient has not had ,
at the time of admission , white count or a significant fever and
his cultures two days prior to discharge have been negative.
3. Cardiovascular. The patient has a significant cardiac
history for CHF and CAD. His heart rhythm has been mostly stable
during the course of his hospitalization. Hypertension has been
treated with Lopressor.
4. Renal. The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency. However , renal function had improved during the
patient's hospital course. At the time of discharge , the patient
had a creatinine of 0.9 , a BUN of 38 , a potassium of 3.9 and a
creatinine of 0.9. Presumably , the aggressive diuresis that was
conducted did not affect the patient's renal function adversely.
5. Endocrine. The patient has a history of
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. He was put on Lantus
and insulin sliding scale , by the end of his day he was on 80
units of Lantus plus requiring additional insulin on the sliding
scale.

CONSULTANTS:
Hematology of BH , Dr. Bradley Ebanks .
ASSESSMENT:
This is an 88-year-old Co Louis Awestinsde male with a history of
hypertension , diabetes , CHF who presented with increasing
shortness of breath likely secondary to CHF and also presented
with a fever concerning for pneumonia for which he was treated
with antibiotics. The patient also had a new diagnosis of
amyloid during this admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: The patient has no known diagnosis of CAD;
however , he has many risk factors. The patient had a troponin of
0.7 on admit which subsequently trended down. This troponin leak
was thought to be due to demand. The patient remained chest
pain-free during his entire hospital course , and had no acute
ischemic issues. The patient was continued on his aspirin ,
beta-blocker and statin medications.
B. Pump: The patient has a history of CHF with an EF of 40-45%.
In the past , this congestive heart failure had been presumably
attributed to ischemic for hypertensive etiology. However ,
during this admission , the patient had a cardiac biopsy that was
positive for amyloid suggesting that amyloid is the cause
underlying his CHF. The patient appeared mildly fluid overloaded
on admission. He was successfully diuresed with 100 IV Lasix for
several days. The patient has been switched to his home dose of
Lasix of 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and was euvolemic for several days
prior to his discharge. His euvolemic weight on 8/10/07 was
64.5 kilograms. His discharge weight will be reported in an
addendum. During this admission , he was continued on his
beta-blocker. His calcium channel blocker and diltiazem was
discontinued during this admission given his likely restrictive
heart physiology with his new diagnosis of amyloid. The patient
was started on a nitrate during this admission in order to reduce
preload. As mentioned above , the patient had a catheterization
with an endomyocardial biopsy that was positive for amyloid. A
panel of other amyloid-related tests were also sent out. Of
note , serum genetic amyloid testing was pending at the time of
discharge. Of note , the patient had a serum immunofixation test
that was within normal limits. The patient had a urine
immunofixation test with a positive monoclonal spike with Lambda
light chain. The patient also had a serum-free light chain assay
that was equivocal/positive. The patient also had positive
proteinuria on a spot urine. The patient also had a bone marrow
biopsy done by Dr. Jarred Canner of MOMH in order to further
define this subtype of amyloid that this patient has and in order
to facilitate a screening of his family members for amyloid. He
also had a bone marrow biopsy given the monoclonal spike on his
urine immunofixation test.
C. Rhythm: The patient has a pacemaker originally put in for
sick sinus syndrome. He is V-paced. The patient was discovered
to be in atrial fibrillation on this admission. On 7/9/07 , the
EP Service changed the pacemaker setting to VVI given that the
patient was in atrial fibrillation and decreased the heart rate
to the 60s-70s. The patient remained on telemetry throughout his
stay which was uneventful. The patient was also started on
Coumadin for anticoagulation given his atrial fibrillation and
the diagnosis of amyloid. The patient remained subtherapeutic
and on 7/11/07 , his INR was still subtherapeutic at 1.5 , and he
will most likely be discharged on Coumadin 3.5 mg every evening
which will be adjusted as necessary at the Rehabilitation
Facility.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient presented with a mild cough.
The patient had a fever on admit but was afebrile after one to
two days on antibiotics. The patient had no leukocytosis.
Again , there was a question of pneumonia on the chest x-ray and
his clinical findings were suspicious for pneumonia. The patient
received a five-day course of levofloxacin at 750 mg daily. The
course of antibiotics ended on 1/27/07 .  The patient had blood ,
urine and sputum cultures which were negative.
3. Heme: The patient has baseline anemia between hematocrit of
31 and 32 which remained stable during his hospitalization. The
patient also has a baseline thrombocytopenia with platelets at
approximately 170 which remained stable throughout his
hospitalization and again the patient as stated above was started
on Coumadin during this admission for atrial fibrillation and for
amyloid. The Coumadin was slowly increased up to 3.5 mg given
subtherapeutic INR. The patient had a bone marrow biopsy done on
5/10/07 as mentioned above in order to further define the
amyloid ??_?? and because of the monoclonal spike on the urine
immunofixation. The final results of the bone marrow biopsy are
pending.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. At first ,
he was on his home dose of NPH insulin which was 20 units
subcutaneous daily as well as an insulin sliding scale. Because
of persistent hypoglycemia , the patient's NPH was reduced to 10
units of NPH insulin subcutaneous daily.
5. FEN: The patient had a low-salt diet and a 2-liter fluid
restriction and was seen by Nutrition inhouse.
6. Renal: The patient had a creatinine of approximately 1.0
which stayed stable throughout his hospitalization.
7. GI: The patient has chronic LFT abnormalities likely
secondary to CHF; however , the etiology is uncertain.
8. Question restless leg syndrome: On 2/19/07 , the patient was
complaining of myoclonic jerks of his right leg which is an old
problem. His general exam was within normal limits. He was
given a trial of magnesium supplementation inhouse for this.
9. Low back , sacral pain: His low back pain appears to be
chronic and it was treated with oxycodone successfully. The
patient also was noted to have a skin tear on his right buttock
which showed no signs of infection and a DuoDERM was placed over
it for wound care. The patient also had a stage I sacral
decubitus ulcer and a DuoDERM was placed on it for wound care and
for protection.
10. Prophylaxis: The patient was on DVT dose Lovenox inhouse
and was also on Coumadin.
11. Physical Therapy: Of note , the patient has a left BKA. The
patient's family brought in his prosthetic leg as well as his
walker. Physical Therapy inhouse worked with the patient , and it
was determined that the patient was unsafe to go home and it was
recommended that he go to a rehabilitation facility to which the
patient finally agreed.

Discharge Date: 10/12/2006
ATTENDING: KRAUS , RALEIGH LOUIS MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67-year-old female
who is transferred from an outside hospital for further
management of her CHF. The patient is a 67-year-old female with
history of coronary artery disease who was first evaluated back
in 2002 when she had a stent placed at THC for symptomatic
coronary artery disease. She reports feeling well until 10/14
when she developed substernal chest burning and pressure and was
admitted to Trowestpot Allch Memorial Hospital , where a dobutamine echo was
positive for ischemia , details unclear and she was transferred to
IIAH for further care. At Deran Medical Center ,
angiography was performed on 8/7/06 with placement of a Cypher
stent in her LAD. The evening following discharge , the patient
reported severe substernal chest pressure and activated her local
EMS. On the way to the hospital , she suffered a Vfib arrhythmia
requiring CPR and 9 defibrillations. At Geft.o Ton Memorial Hospital ,
she was acutely intervened upon with PTCA and found to have a
thrombosed LAD stent. At this point , she was transferred to
R. Medical Center Of on an intraaortic balloon pump for
support. Repeat angiography was performed revealing suboptimal
deployment of the initial stent , which was subsequently outsized
to a diameter of 3.5 mm and additional stenting was performed
distal to the original stent with good anterograde flow noted
postprocedure. The patient was managed in the CCU , where she
remained intubated on the intraaortic balloon pump. Hospital
course was notable for distributive and cardiogenic shock as well
as aspiration pneumonia and HSV , treated with acyclovir. She
improved after two weeks and was discharged on 5/14/06 with an
EF of 40% at the time of discharge. The patient was readmitted
to Tacan Hospital And on 6/16/06 with a CHF exacerbation , was
subsequently diuresed and discharged on 1/27/06 .
Echocardiography at that time demonstrated an EF of 55% with 2 to
3+ MR and RVSP of 45 mmHg. The patient represented to Harl Hospital on 9/23/06 reporting progressive dyspnea , weight
gain , PND , orthopnea and cough. At that time , she underwent
repeat angiography demonstrating RA 14 , RV 55/13 , PA 61/25/42 ,
PCWP 35 with V 246 , LHC with AO 86/57. Angiography revealed a
right dominant circulation and LMCA , which was patent , LAD 20%
mid , D1 40% , ostial left circumflex 20% mid , RCA 60% prox , LV
gram with an EF of 25% associated with global hypokinesis and
severe MR. The patient was subsequently transferred to Palm Health Systems for further management of her advanced heart failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant in addition to above for
hypertension , type 2 diabetes on insulin , obesity , COPD ,
hyperlipidemia , GERD , hypothyroidism , depression , status post
appendectomy and status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Include aspirin 325 daily , Lasix 80 mg
IV b.i.d. , Diovan 160 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , levothyroxine
88 mcg daily , Lipitor 20 mg daily , Zetia 10 mg daily , Aldactone
25 mg daily , Protonix 20 mg daily , Advair 500/50 one puff daily
and insulin 70/30 , 30 units subq b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Include erythromycin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband and works in
a clothing company. She smokes 1-2 packs per day x46 years until
nine years ago. No alcohol use. No illicits.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient reports coronary artery disease in
one sibling. No premature cardiac catheterization. Mother died
of cervical cancer. Father died of alcoholism.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denies fever , chills , nausea ,
vomiting , abdominal pain , hemoptysis , bright red blood per
rectum , hematochezia , or melena , no chest pain or palpitations.
Positive for cough and shortness of breath. No changes in mental
status or loss of consciousness , no dysuria , no exposures. No
recent travel. No presyncope or dizziness.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for creatinine of 1 from
baseline of 0.7 to 0.8. Hematocrit of 34 , baseline 37. ALT 68 ,
AST 33 and alkaline phosphatase 384 down from 616 on last
admission. INR 1. EKG , sinus rhythm at 90 , normal axis
intervals with old anterior septal MI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for afebrile , heart rate in the
90s , blood pressure 98/60 , respiratory rate 18-20 , satting 98% on
3 liters. The patient was in no acute distress , pleasant ,
resting comfortably. Oropharynx clear. JVP 10 cm with 2+
carotids without bruits. No thyromegaly , no lymphadenopathy.
Decreased breath sounds with bibasilar crackles with prolonged
expiratory phase and intermittent expiratory wheezing. Regular
rate and rhythm , S1 and S2. Notable S3 , no MR appreciated.
Abdomen was obese , distended , soft , nontender , no
hepatosplenomegaly. Positive bowel sounds. Extremities , 1+
lower extremity edema to the shins with 1+ DP and PT pulses
bilaterally. Pretibial erythema , right greater than left. No
other rashes. Right groin minimally tender without bruit. Cath
site clean , dry , intact. Neurologic exam is nonfocal.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: In summary , this is a 67-year-old female
with multiple cardiac risk factors including hypertension ,
hyperlipidemia , diabetes , coronary artery disease status post LAD
stent complicated by a subacute thrombosis with marked left
ventricular dysfunction with a reportedly revascularized right
coronary territory and severe MR on repeat echo. Despite
diuresis at the outside hospital , the patient remained volume
overloaded with biventricular failure on exam. The patient was
admitted to medically optimized heart failure regimen to further
clarify component of mitral regurgitation. Repeat TTE and right
and left heart catheterization to further evaluate and optimize
medical management. The patient was maintained on aspirin ,
Plavix , ARB , statin and Zetia. Beta-blocker was continued at low
dose given decompensated state. Adenosine MIBI was completed ,
which was notable for recovery 1 mm ST depressions in leads II ,
III and aVF , which resolved. There is no further evidence of
ischemia. EF was notable to be severely depressed; however ,
moderate MR on outside hospital echo was not reproducible here.
Cardiovascular surgery was initially consulted to further
evaluate for benefit of mitral valve replacement surgery;
however , this will likely not be of benefit given mild MR on
repeat echo. In addition a contrast echo was performed to
further evaluate for evidence of clot given the severe right
ventricle malfunction , and anticoagulation was started; however ,
there was no evidence of clot on echo. In addition , on echo ,
reevaluated for dyssynchrony , which was negative. The patient
was diuresed with IV Lasix until near euvolemic and then
transitioned to p.o. regimen. The patient was maintained on
Aldactone. The EP service evaluated for possible placement of
AICD versus biventricular pacemaker; however , given the patient
is not yet outside of three-month window and was noninducible on
EP study , she will need close monitoring as an outpatient with
repeat echo in 2 months and a further EP study to readdress. The
patient will be anticoagulated in the meantime. Respiratory:
The patient has history of COPD with no evidence of acute
exacerbation. Inhalers were continued. PFTs and VO2 study may
be considered as an outpatient. Renal: Creatinine was mildly
elevated compared with baseline , likely secondary to mild dye
nephropathy and overaggressive diuresis. Creatinine stabilized ,
will need to be followed closely as an outpatient as well as
electrolytes. GI. The patient was maintained on a bowel
regimen. LFTs were elevated on admission consistent with right
heart failure versus statin. LFTs trended down on admission.
Hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable at baseline. The
patient will remain on heparin to Coumadin bridge with Lovenox
bridge as an outpatient if needed. Endocrine: The patient has a
history of poorly controlled diabetes and was maintained on
insulin as an inpatient with sliding scale coverage. History of
hypothyroidism , on Levoxyl. TSH within normal limits. ID: No
acute issues. The patient was treated for asymptomatic
bacteriuria secondary to possible permanent pacemaker placement.
She developed itchiness , which is likely secondary to the
Bactrim. Provided supportive care , the patient should avoid
Bactrim in the future secondary to intolerance. No serious
reactions were observed. Psychiatric: The patient has a history
of depression. She was continued on home medications. FEN: The
patient was maintained on a cardiac diet with sodium and volume
restriction , K mag scales. Nutrition was consulted.
Dermatologic: The patient has a history of HSV , status post
acyclovir treatment. No evidence of further infection. The
patient had pretibial erythema , which derm was consulted for ,
which they felt was consistent with venous stasis. She improved
with steroid cream and compression. The patient was prophylaxed
with Protonix and heparin. The patient was instructed to follow
up with cardiology , weigh herself daily with careful notice to
weight gain reporting to the physician and to returne to the ED
with worsening shortness of breath or chest pain. The patient
was instructed to follow a fluid restricted , low-fat ,
low-cholesterol diet as well as a restricted sodium diet. She
will follow up with her PCP Dr. Kuhnke at 786-179-5001 on
1/4/06 at 2:45. Dr. Yatsko at 051-469-9935 on 3/12/06 at 3:45.
INR will be drawn on 1/1/06 with followup INRs to be drawn
every five days. INRs will be followed by PCP.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
86 yo man w/ acute renal failure , gross hematuria , bladder mass.
RENAL:
*ARF* Original ddx included prerenal ( decreased PO intake , glucosuria )
vs. renal ( URI --> glomerulonephritis ) vs. postrenal ( mass , clots -->
B obstruction ... but no hydronephrosis ). Cr came down from 5.3 to near
nl w/ hydration suggesting prerenal etiology. Urine examined under
microscope was without red blood cell casts. On presentation , pt. had no
acute indication for dialysis. He was not uremic , had no rub , had good
urine output , had mild acedemia , and had normal K.As noted , his Cr came
down to near normal with hydration.
*bladder mass* A bladder mass surrounded by blood clots was identified on
the patient's admission CT. Due to conern for bladder cancer , urine
cytology was sent. Results are pending. On 8/19 , the urology team
performed a cystoscopy which revealed a large bladder stone surrounded by
hemorrhage. The clot was evacuated and the stone was broken up by
electrohydraulic lithotripsy. Biopsy samples were
taken from the inflamed bladder wall. Pathology results are pending. A
3-way foley catheter was placed and continuous bladder irrigation was
initiated. The patient received peri-procedure antibiosis with ancef and
gent. The large size of the bladder stone suggests urinary retension ,
perhaps due to persistent BPH ( despite 2000 TURP ). The patient was started
on flomax and proscar , as recommended by the urology team. The patient was
discharged with a foley catheter in place. He will return to NC urology
clinics on 10/22 for a voiding trial.
CV:
pump
*HTN* In house , pt. was treated with norvasc and lopressor. He was
discharged on norvasc and toprol XL. Ace inhibition was not initiated due
to the patient's renal insufficiency.
*murmur* On exam , pt. had a systolic ejection murmur heard best at the
R and L upper sternal border and radiating to the carotids. An ECHO
revealed a preserved ejection fraction of 65% , no RWMA , nl
diastolic function , normal RV size and function , nl LA and RA size ,
and mild AS with a valve area of 1.4. The patient is not
symptomatic from his AS , by history. He denies syncope , chest pain ,
orthopnea , PND , or LE edema.
rhythm: NSR
ischemia:
*CAD*
Pt. reported no chest pain. His admission EKG showed new inferior/lateral
ST-T changes. Cardiac markers revealed CK 330 , CKMB 7.5 , and Tn I<assay.
His EKG changes could represent old infarct ( although ECHO showed no
RWMA ) or could represent demand ischemia in the setting of
hypertension and anemia. Pt. was treated with a bblocker , as above. Pt was
not treated with ASA given his hematuria , but such
therapy may be started on an outpatient basis. Pt. was not treated with an
acei due to his creatinine , but such therapy , too , may be started on an
outpatient basis. Pt. may also benefit from outpt. stress testing. Lipids
profile showed cholesterol 156 , triglycerides 119 , HDL 39 , LDL 93.
GI: *reflux* Pt. was treated with nexium and mylanta PRN.
He was maintained on a cardiac , diabetic diet.
ENDO: *new DM , most likely type II* On admission pt. had a small anion
gap , mild elevation of +B-hydroxybutyrate , and +ketones in his urine.
With hydration , his gap closed. The ketoacidosis was likely from
starvation. Pt's HGa1c was 10. ( He had not seen a physician in years ). He
will be d/c'ed on glipizide 5. ( Metoformin was not started out of concern
for rising creatinine. He may benefit from the addition of a second oral
agent as an oupatient ). Pt. will be given a glucometer and asked to check
his blood sugar mornings.
HEME: *anemia* Pt. had a normocytic anemia , likely related to hematuria ,
gu+ stool. Iron studies revealed a Fe 49 , TIBC 294 , Ferr 73. He
was started on a multivitamin with iron. He would benefit from outpatient
colonoscopy. Prior to discharge , hematocrit was stable in the mid 30s.
ID: Pt. was afebrile. Admission u/a was suggestive of UTI. Ucx , however ,
was negative. CXR was clear. Pt. received abx peri-cystoscopy.
PROPH: pneumoboots ( pt. was not treated with lovenox given his
hematuria )
CODE: full
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Pt. will require VNA for nursing and home PT.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
45 yo M with multiple cardiac risk factors ,
including known CAD s/p MI ( 10/12 with PCI to LAD , complicated by
instent thrombosis 1 week post-cath->successfully restented ) ,
HTN , dyslipidemia , obesity , and positive FHx
presents with acute onset of chest pain. The patient
has had several episodes/admissions for recurrent
c/p since then with caths consistently
demonstrating non-significant disease. Last cath in 3/8
showed R dominant system with 30% proximal LAD lesion.
ETT-MIBI in 1/23 ( 9:30 , 5.2 METS , HR 153 , BP 130/80 , was non-ischemic
but terminated 2/2 fatigue ) showed large fixed defect in
anterior , anteroseptal , anterolateral , inferior , LV
apex with EF of 35%. Seen 9/7 at GH for
syncope , dx with VT and had AICD
placed.
On this occasion
he noted sudden onset of 8/10 chest pain while
at rest at 6:30 pm on the evening of admission.
The pain was sharp/stabbing and was bilateral
with radiation to the L arm. He also had
diaphoresis , SOB , and nausea but denies vomitting , F/C ,
LH , dizziness. He took 1 TNG SL with some relief.
EMS transported to Greena Hospital where his vitals were 98.2 , 73 , 92/62 ,
15. Rec'd IV TNG , heparin , MSO4 , ASA with pain down to 4/10.
Transfered to ITH .  A: 45 yo M with known CAD s/p MI in 10/12 ,
s/p recent ICD placement for syncope/VT at BMC ,
now with his angina at rest. Given non-oclusive
CAD on multiple recent caths ( including 2 mos ago
at EHC per patient ) , likelihood of ischemia now
is low.
P: CV: Ischemia-r/o MI , asa , toprol , heparin , plavix , zocor. Ruled out
by ensymes , ETT was non-ischemic. Pump-euvolemic , no h/o CHF
Rhythm-has AICD , on tele , replete lytes
GI: has lost 40 lbs on liquid diet , consider nutrition consult as
outpatient
CODE: FULL CODE
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please be sure to contact Dr. Klussmann ( 485-738-3098 ) to set up an
appointment to be seen in about 1 week. Also , be sure to set up an
appointment to see Dr. Helfgott ( 717-968-0482 ) in about 4 weeks.
You should contact your doctor or return to the emergency room if you
experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain , chest pressure ,
shortness of breath , dizziness , lightheadedness , nausea , vomitting , or
any other concerning symptoms.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Consider increasing CCB as patient seems to feel it helps his
symptoms.
2. Consider adjusting HTN meds as patient was relatively hypotensive
( SBP 90-110 ) in hospital ( althought asymptomatic ).
3. Consider outpatient cardiac rehabillitation.
4. Consider nutrition consult as outpatient to ensure adequate
nutrition status on ""liquid diet""

Discharge Date: 5/26/2005
ATTENDING: QUINCY BRIDENBAUGH MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypoglycemia.
2. Altered mental status.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. Volume overload likely secondary to CHF.
2. Possible pneumonia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for:
1. Bilateral occipital CVAs.
2. Diabetes , on insulin.
3. Hypertension.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. Coronary artery disease.
6. Visual impair with tunnel vision.
7. Monoclonal gammopathy.
8. Bilateral occipital CVAs.
9. History of left upper extremity thrombophlebitis.
10. Microcytic anemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman who was found at home with
altered mental status by home services and home nursing with
confusion. Her fingerstick was 37 , which increased to 42 with
orange juice with improvement of her mental status. Her insulin
regimen has been stable for quite some time. She had taken her
regular dose of Novolin 40 units on the morning of admission.
She was sent to the emergency department. She has noted
increasing bilateral lower extremity edema over one or two
months , increased dyspnea on exertion , nocturia. In the ED , her
ambulatory sat was 91% on room air. Glucose was still low and on
chest x-ray there was evidence of a right pleural effusion and
right lower lobe consolidation versus atelectasis. She was given
Lasix , glucose , Levaquin , and blood cultures were drawn. She was
admitted for treatment of pneumonia.
She has an allergy to propoxyphene.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 80 mg p.o q.d. in the morning , 40 mg p.o. q.d. in the
evening.
2. Atenolol 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Amitriptyline 25 to 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
5. Multivitamins.
6. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Folate 100 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Iron gluconate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d.
10. Novolin 34 to 40 units subcu. q.d.
11. Epogen 5000 units subcu. q. week.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Father died of an MI in his 70s , mother died of leukemia. No
history of hematologic disorders in her family. No history of
thalassemia that the patient knows of.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She lives in an assisted living facility and has extensive home
care services and lives alone. She was previously a nurse. She
has children who live nearby.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Vital signs: Temperature was 95.2 , blood pressure 111/69 , heart
rate 73 , sating 97% on room air. She was alert and oriented x3.
Speech and mentation were normal. No lymphadenopathy. 2/6
systolic murmur at the base radiating to across her precordium.
Distant heart sounds. Right lower lobe with decreased breath
sounds and decreased phrenitis , wheezing throughout her right
lung. Abdomen: Obese , soft , nondistended , nontender , benign.
Extremities: 2 to 3+ pitting edema bilateral and symmetric.
Neurologic: She was moving all extremities well. Left eye with
slight lateral deviation. Extraocular movements intact. Pupils
equally round and reactive to light. Evidence of an old
cataract.
ADMISSION DATA:
BNP of 1111 , creatinine was 2.4 which was below her baseline of
2.6 to 2.8 , white count was 6.6 with no left shift , hematocrit
was 35.7 which is up from her baseline of 27 to 33. MCV was 67.4
which is stable and it has been in this range and she was found
to have in 5/25 a monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP. EKG showed
an inferoseptal Q wave , poor R wave progression , low voltage left
axis deviation. Echo in 5/25 showed an EF of 50 to 55% with
moderate-to-severe MR and TR , septal hypokinesis and a MIBI at
that time showed no reversible ischemia. Chest x-ray as
describes above. UA negative for UTI.
IMPRESSION:
The patient was evaluated to be low likelihood for having
pneumonia. She was thought to more likely have volume overload
secondary to CHF. Because of her visual problems and declining
physical condition and deconditioning , patient's current living
situation and arrangements are possibly insufficient for her
increasing needs and error in self administration of medications
or increasing renal insufficiency or poor p.o. intake may have
precipitated her hypoglycemic episode and altered mental status.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
ID/Pulmonary: Right lower lobe pneumonia versus CHF , pleural
effusion. This was treated initially with levofloxacin although
it is unlikely consolidated lobar pneumonia because of the
patient's good clinical status , lack of fever and white count and
lack of toxicity. Sputum culture and gram stein were
unremarkable. Pleural effusion on the right decreased only
minimally with diuresis of 1 to 2 liters overnight and for
diagnostic and therapeutic purposes , the patient underwent a
thoracentesis on 3/1/05 and had withdraw 800 cc of clear yellow
fluid whose chemistries and cell count were consistent with a
sterile transudative effusion. Gram stein was negative.
Cultures are pending at this time and a chest x-ray may be
repeated to rule out underlying pneumonia revealed by draining of
the effusion. Urine legionella was negative.
Renal: Chronic renal insufficiency. Creatinine is at a baseline
of 2.6 and it decreased significantly on this admission possibly
because of improved forward flow from discontinuation of her ACE
inhibitor.
Endocrinology: The patient was admitted with hypoglycemic
diabetes possibly secondary to infection or logistical and social
barriers. Her NPH dose was cut to 20 units subcu. q.d. with
lispro sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s. which she needed only
minimally about 5 units a day and her sugars were well controlled
on this regimen which supports the hypothesis that her NPH dose
of 34 units a day was too high beyond a certain point.
Cardiac:
A. Pump: The patient with CHF , known valvular dysfunction ,
exhibiting pulmonary edema , lower extremity edema and orthopnea.
She was initially diuresed with IV Lasix and it was noted that
her weight was up 10 pounds from her prior admission. She was
transitioned to p.o. Lasix after diuresing very well on this
regimen. She continued her Lipitor and aspirin , atenolol was
changed metoprolol given her renal insufficiency. Lisinopril was
switched to captopril , then discontinued given her bumping
creatinine while diuresing on the ACE inhibitor. She was
slightly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 90s to
100s at one point and responded to a bolus of fluid , decrease in
the captopril and holding the Lasix , unclear etiology , looks
otherwise low. Lasix was decreased to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and the
patient should have daily weights and electrolytes checked and
repleted to ensure that her diuresis is only moderate everyday no
more than one liter a day but is consistent such that she is able
to maintain her electrolytes and loose fluid overtime.
Heme: The patient has a monoclonal gammopathy and a microcytosis
which might suggest thalassemia. She is on iron and Epogen with
an improved hematocrit from the prior admission but no change in
her MCV , which suggests that she has more than renal disease
causing her microcytosis. Further workup of her monoclonal
gammopathy will be deferred to her primary care physician.
Diabetic diet: Low sodium , low fat , low cholesterol.
Prophylaxis: Heparin and H2 blocker.
DISPOSITION:
The patient has been screened for admission to Jack Nor Medical Center Of where
she will go today. Her goal is intense physical therapy and
learning greater independence in her daily functioning. Her
pelvic films were negative for fracture. She should be ambulated
t.i.d.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Amitriptyline 25 to 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
5. Multivitamins.
6. Aspirin325 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8. Lisinopril should be held for the moment.
9. Iron gluconate 325 mg p.o. q.i.d.
10. NPH 20 units subcu. q.h.s.
11. Lispro sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s.
12. Epogen 5000 units subcu. q. week.
Ms Mengel should follow up with Dr. Rufener when she is able to
within the next week or two. Ellington is her primary care
physician , Jarrett Sandlan her PCP number is 653-609-3621. She
should b switched to Toprol as her blood pressure tolerates and
to lisinopril as her creatinine tolerates after low-level
diuresis of about 50 cc to one liter a day. Studies pending
include cytology and culture of pleural fluid and follow-up chest
x-ray on the day of her discharge. Lasix dose can be increased as
needed for better diuresis.

prostatectomy presents w/ 2 d hx SOB , confusion , shoulder pain. Pt
was in USOH out w/ wife to lunch Friday ( 3 d PTA ) before admission ,
ate onion soup and club sandwich , then on Sat felt nauseated , SOB ,
confused. Wife noted that pt could not lie down to sleep Sat night
( usually 3 pillow orthopnea ). Sx cont through Sun , wife brought to ED
on Mon , day of admission. Pt recently in LRMC ED , rx for UTI 1/7 .  In
ED pt afebrile , HR 59 , BP 152/61 , Sa 97% on 4L NC. On exam found to
have JVP elevated 12-14 cm H2O , bibasilar rales , dec breath sounds at
bases , RRR , no murmurs , no gallops , 1+ pitting edema bilat LE. Labs
significant for Na 144 Cl 113 , Hco3 19 , BUN 30 , Cr 1.9 , platelets 97.
UA showed 15-20 WBC , 2-5 RBC. EKG was unchanged , CXR showed worsening
bilat pleural effusions.
Hospital Course:
1. CV- Pt was not r/o secondary to low probability of ischemia. CHF
exacerbation likely secondary to Na overload from pt's meal the Friday
before admission. Pt was diuresed gently with 20 lasix IV x 2 on the
first day of admission and then received 20 po lasix on the day of
discharge. The pt's pulmonary status and mental status improved with
diuresis and his JVD decreased to approx 8 cm H2O on exam.
2. ID: pt w/ presumed UTI , rx w/ bactrim
3. Disposition: Pt was eval by PT , who made recs for home PT for the
pt. This arrangement was satisfactory for the pt and his wife. He
will follow up with all of his physicians with his regular scheduled

Discharge Date: 4/1/2006
ATTENDING: JESCHON , SHANE M.D.
SERVICE: GMS PACE team.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CHF exacerbation.
LIST OF DIAGNOSIS DURING ADMISSION:
1. CHF/dilated cardiomyopathy
2. Chronic headache.
3. Chronic abdominal pain.
4. Iron deficiency anemia.
5. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old female with a
past medical history significant for CHF exacerbations , dilated
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 25-30% , history of depression ,
bipolar disorder , and history of polysubstance abuse who
presented to Ami Ge County Hospital on 10/2/2006 ,
complaining of worsening shortness of breath and abdominal pain.
The patient had noted that she had increasing lower extremity
edema , decreased appetite and nausea; however , she had no weight
loss. Of note , the patient was recently admitted overnight on
3/3/2006 , with similar complaints. In the ED , the patient
complained of abdominal pain , which reportedly is chronic. Pain
is thought to be related to keloids at the sites of her open
cholecystectomy scar and hysterectomy scar. The patient had a
CAT scan of her abdomen done on her last admission on 6/2/06 ,
which showed diffuse micronodular opacities with wide ranging
differential diagnosis including infectious colitis , lymphoma , or
mastocytosis. A colonoscopy is recommended for further
evaluation. The patient was admitted to the hospital for control
of her shortness of breath , which was related to CHF exacerbation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for dilated cardiomyopathy ,
history of depression , bipolar disorder , polysubstance abuse , and
hepatitis C.
PREADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , Elavil 100 mg
q.h.s. , Klonopin 0.5 mg b.i.d. , iron 325 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg

20 mg q.h.s. , Toprol-XL 50 mg daily , Imdur 60 mg daily , Cozaar 25
mg daily , Aricept 5 mg daily , Seroquel 300 mg q.h.s. , Prilosec 20
mg daily , and potassium chloride 40 mEq daily
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to penicillin and
erythromycin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient currently resides at home alone.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for chronic headache and chronic
abdominal pain , as well as worsening shortness of breath as noted
above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile.
Heart rate 92 , blood pressure 154/91 , and respiratory rate 18.
O2 saturation was 100% on 2 liters and 96% on room air. The
patient was comfortable in no apparent distress. She is awake ,
alert , and oriented x3. The patient had an elevated JVD. Her
heart was regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2. Chest
was positive for bibasilar crackles and wheezing throughout.
Abdomen was obese , soft , and nondistended. Diffuse tenderness ,
especially at cheloid site. Extremities , 2+ pitting edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , creatinine 0.9 , BUN 21 and
hematocrit 36.1. BNP was greater than assay. EKG with normal
sinus rhythm with a rate of 80 , which showed biatrial
enlargement , LVH and a prolonged QT. This was unchanged from
prior EKGs. Chest x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly with no acute
cardiopulmonary process.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient's shortness of breath was
attributed to her CHF , and the patient was treated with Lasix 80
mg IV b.i.d. with a goal of greater than 1 liter negative per
day. The patient's weight was monitored daily. On admission , it
was 180.4 pounds and on discharge , it was 167 pounds. The
patient's creatinine was also closely monitored and it did bump
to 1.3 on 4/18/2006 , but then on discharge , it went back down to
1.1. The patient was discharged home on her usual home dose of
Lasix , which is 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient's ambulating O2
saturation was 99% on room air. The patient did have some
intermittent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
She remained asymptomatic. Her electrolytes were repleted
aggressively and the patient's metoprolol was increased from 12.5
mg to 25 mg t.i.d. As a result , the patient was sent home on
Toprol 75 mg daily instead of her prior home dose of 50 mg daily.
The patient had cardiac enzymes checked because of her
intermittent episodes of NSVT. The patient's troponin was less
than assay. She was continued on aspirin , spironolactone ,
lisinopril , Imdur , Zocor , and Cozaar. The patient also has
outpatient appointments with cardiology in the CHF clinic.
2. GI: The patient has a history of chronic abdominal pain and
a history of ischemic colitis. Pain during this admission was
similar to previous pain. On exam , the patient was diffusely
tender; however , it seemed to mostly be at the site of her
keloids. The patient was referred to have an outpatient
colonoscopy. The patient's primary care physician was notified
to arrange this procedure.
3. Neurology: The patient has a history of chronic daily
headaches and migraines , and she had a persistent headache during
this admit. She was treated with Tylenol , Reglan and warm
compresses p.r.n. , which did control her pain. The patient also
was continued on Elavil. A followup appointment in the headache
clinic was made with Dr. Fabello on 1/7/2000 .
4. Psychiatry: The patient has a history of drug seeking
behavior. No narcotics were prescribed for headaches during this
admission. She was continued on Klonopin 0.5 mg q.12h. and
Aricept 5 mg daily. New psychiatry followup appointment was
arranged prior to discharge.
5. Hematology: The patient had both microcytosis and
hypochromia by RBC indices , which were suggestive of iron
deficiency anemia. She was continued on her iron
supplementation.
6. Dermatology: The patient did complain of some right deltoid
pain. On exam , right deltoid was tender and erythematous;
however , it did improve without any treatment and on day of
discharge , it was only mildly tender with no erythema.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was continued on Nexium and was
given Lovenox 40 mg daily for DVT prophylaxis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On discharge , the patient's vital signs
were stable. Her JVP was flat. Lungs were clear , and the
patient only had trace edema in her lower extremities. Weight on
discharge was 167 pounds. Oxygen saturation while ambulating
with 99% on room air.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was given a prescription for
her new increased dose of Toprol 75 mg p.o. daily. The patient
had physician home care set up for her where she will have CHF
monitoring and daily weights. The patient was instructed on a
1.5 liter fluid restriction at home and low-sodium diet. The
patient is to follow up with her primary care physician , Dr.
Cary Genco on 6/1/2006 , at 11:00 a.m , follow up with
Dr. Tillotson , psychiatry on 7/14/2006 , at 1:00 p.m. , Dr. Booker G Fracassa from cardiology on 1/26/2006 , at 9:00 a.m. and Dudley D Crout in CHF Clinic on 5/25/2006 , at 3:30 p.m. Lastly , the
patient is to follow up in the headache clinic with Dr. Durant
on 11/21/2006 .  The patient was notified that she should have an

orthopnea , PND , and LE swelling , BNP=870. Was admitted for treatment of
CHF.
---
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV:
*Pump: Cont'd ACE ( Lisinopril 40daily ) , utilized Lasix ( max Lasix dose
40IV bid ) to initiate diuresis. Orthopnea resolved after 3days of
diuresis. ECHO obtained on HD#4=nl LV size w/mild conc hypertrophy , and
severely reduced function ( EF15-20% ) and global hypokinesis. Mod RVE
and hypertrophy , and globally reduced function. Mild LAE , mod RAE.
Trace to mild MR , mod to severe TR , trace PR , and sm pericardial
effusion. The CHF service consult ( Dr. Busler ) obtained hx of 20oz
port wine consumption 3+days/wk. CHF team is attributing non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy to idiopathic vs ETOH. Rec'd goal SBP<120 ,
agreed w/diuresis , ACE , +/-adding ARB , and changing b-blocker back to
Atenolol.
CHF team advised there is was clear indication for anti-coagulation. F/u
appts made Houston Jackson Hugo K. Torain . Pt will have VNA-CHF
home services.
Admit wt=197.6lbs , d/c wt=185.5lbs.
*Isch: Hx of NSTEMI , pos MIBI , neg cardiac cath 11/3 .  Has a baseline
abnormal EKG that is concerning for inf/lat ischemia. Had a troponin
leak this admit in setting of CHF. Repeat CAD workup not pursued. Cont'd
Aspirin , and B-blocker ( was initially on Metoprolol 25tid , then
transitioned back to Atenolol 50daily per CHF service recs ).
Tchol=119 , HDL=26 , LDL=77. Pt is DM , but no statin was started b/c of
elevated LFTs.
*Rhythm: Episode of NSVT 10/23 ( R-on-T VT in setting of QT prolongation
QTc=526 ). No additional ventricular arrhythmias were recorded on
via continuous telemetry monitoring. CHF service advised deferring AICD
placement unless pt fails 6mos of optimal medical CHF managment. Repeat
EKG's 10/13 QTc=495 , 5/9 QTc=478. Decision was made to cont Fluoxetine ,
given the minute risk that this med would contribute to QT prolongation.
2. GI:
*Team suspects hepatocongestion/GI venous congestion and/or gut ischemia
from poor arterial perfusion as cause of recent GI c/o's and LFTs. Low
grade abd pain and N/V resolved as team treated CHF , transaminases
remained ess unchanged.
PRN Reglan was continued. If GI symptoms return , pt may need additional
outpt workup ( HIDA scan , gastric emptying study ). Pt has an existing GI
appt to see Dr. Skwara in 11/13 .
*Cont'd PPI for gastritis , duodenitis seen on EGD 10/25 .  It is unclear if
this can completely explain pt's Fe def anemia. She will need an outpt
colonoscopy to further eval.
*Celiac sprue studies were sent=pending at time of discharge.
3. ENDO: hx of DM-2 , HgA1c=8.8. Pt advised team that she prefer to
discontinue Glucophage in favor of starting insulin. During this admit DM
was managed w/bid NPH , pre-meal novolog , and AC/HS novolog scales. On
10/13 pt's total insulin requirement was 44units. FSBS 6/12 8am ) ,
271( 12pm ). Pt to transition to Lantus 35units qam to begin 7/25 .  VNA
arranged for insulin teaching and to assist PCP w/dose titration. Syringe
education was provided.
4. HEME:
*RBC: microcytic hypochromic fe deficient anemia. RI=2.19. Pt did not
save stool to perform stool guaiac testing. Cont'd Ferrous Sulfate this
admit , added Colace and Senna for constipation prophy. Will likely need
outpt colonoscopy , team deferring this to PCP and Dr. Daso ( outpt GI ).
Hg-electrophoresis was sent=pending at time of discharge.
*Coags: mildly elevated PTT/INR this admit. Suspect nutritional
depletion of vit K +/- ?liver dysfunction from CHF/liver congestion
leading to mild auto-anticoagulation. INR improved as pt able to
tolerate POs. She was not treated w/Vit K.
5. MISC:
*Nutrition consulted for heart failure and DM diet teaching.
TH social worker was consulted to assist pt w/maintaining abstinence
upon discharge. Pt given instructions to f/u w/her outpt Jerrod J Whitehill at Insonmahunt , New York 40955
*Full code during this admission.

ATTENDING: BRICE ARMSON M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS ON ADMISSION: This is a 73-year-old
female with known coronary artery disease , status post CABG , now
with CHF of 30% and a long history of second hand smoke
inhalation , who presented with shortness of breath. One week
prior to admission , she had had upper respiratory infection
symptoms and with some sick contacts. One day prior to
admission , the patient began with increased shortness of breath
over a 3 to 4-hour period while lying down. She came to the
emergency room where she was found to be wheezing. She did not
have any chest pressure or pain , but she did have some shortness
of breath and a cough productive of white sputum. She had no
wheezing , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and no change in her eating
habits. No missed medications. She denied any PND , DOE or
orthopnea , and she had not noticed increased leg edema. In the
emergency department , she was given Atrovent , prednisone , Lasix ,
albuterol nebulizers and Solu-Medrol as it was unknown at the
time whether or not this was a CHF exacerbation or a COPD
exacerbation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile at 97.5 with a pulse of
71 , blood pressure of 111/63 , and respiratory rate of 18 ,
saturating 98% on 2 liters. Physical examination was more
significant for a DVD at 10 cm. Heart exam was significant for
gallops being absent. No S3 or S4. Respiratory exam was
significant for some wheezes , but no rales however.
ADMISSION LABORATORY: A Chem 7 was significant for hyponitremia
at 132 and a hyperkalemia at 5.4. Her digoxin level was
therapeutic at 1.8. Total bilirubin was 1.8. A BNP was mildly
elevated at 189. First set of enzymes were cardiac enzymes to
rule out MI were negative.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: The patient's admission medications were
digoxin 0.25 mg daily , Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d. , Lipitor 80 mg daily ,
Coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d. , spironolactone 12.5 mg daily , aspirin 81 mg
daily , nitroglycerin p.r.n. , and Lasix.
ALLERGIES: Included Captopril , which gave her a cough.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lived with family. Denied any drinking and
smoking , but however did have significant second hand smoke
inhalation history by her husband having been a heavy smoker
during their many years of marriage.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease in
which she had an acute myocardial infarction in 1995 for which a
stent was placed in the LAD. She then had an instant V stenosis
and had then a two-vessel CABG , which was the SVG to the LAD , and
the SVG to the RCA. In 1997 , she had a SVG , LAD stent to
stenosis to then to VStent. In 1988 she had a third SVG LAD
stent placed and an ICD was placed for a low VF and presumably
arrhythmias. The cardiac risk factors include hypertension ,
hyperlipidemia , and smoke inhalation history.
She was admitted for shortness of breath , presumes likely
secondary to a CHF or reactive airway disease precipitated by an
upper respiratory tract infection.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. The patient was cycled through
three sets of enzymes , which were all negative. The patient did
not have chest pressure or pain at any moment of her
hospitalization and did not need any nitroglycerin. There were
no EKG changes. She was continued on her statin , beta blocker ,
and ACE inhibitor , and aspirin. Cardiovascular pump. The
patient oscillated between the mildly fluid overloaded to
euvolemic. She was maintained on Lasix , and did well that way.
The patient received an echo on May , 2004 , which showed
normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with
overall systolic function being moderately in pair with ejection
fraction of 35%. There was severe hypokinesis and akinesis
involving the mid distal septum apex and distal inferior and
lateral walls , and there was also abnormal septal motion
consistent with intraventricular conduction delay. An ICP was
seen to be in place and the aortic valve was mildly calcified.
The left atrium was mildly enlarged. There was also moderate
tricuspid regurgitation with velocity of 2.9 m/second detecting
pulmonary artery systolic pressures of 33mmHg. It was determined
that since 7/26 there had been no significant interval change.
Rhythm: The patient was in normal sinus rhythm with an ICD
placed. There were no issues.
2. Pulmonary: Initially when the patient was admitted with her
significant coronary history , she was being treated like a CHF
exacerbation. However , despite her being relatively refractory
treatment it was decided to increase the treatments for a
possible COPD exacerbation. In this way , she was receiving
Duonebs and albuterol nebulizers 2-2 hours alternating and it was
decided to change her from p.o. prednisone to 60 mg p.o. q.a.m.
In addition , Tessalon Perles and guaifenesin was added. Finally ,
azithromycin was added so as to possibly treat any atypical
pneumonia as the patient had only some interstitial pattern on
her chest x-ray , and did not have any focal area of
consolidation.
3. Endocrine: When the patient was admitted , she was maintained
on her home dose regimen for diabetes mellitus. However , when
being admitted she was given p.o. prednisone for COPD
exacerbation , and therefore , had uncontrolled blood sugars.
Because a finger stick blood glucose and insulin sliding scale
did not fully control her blood glucose. She at one point began
to have an non-gap metabolic acidosis. Anticipating possible
decay , she was started on regular lab draws and insulin drips.
Her gap promptly closed and the patient was , otherwise ,
asymptomatic. She did not have any potassium , fluid or other
complications. Throughout she was also receiving NPH insulin in
the a.m. and p.m.
The patient was discharged to follow with her primary care
physician , and the patient received at home VNA services.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her discharge medications included
1. NPH insulin10 units in the a.m. and 4 units in the p.m.
2. Flovent , Tessalon Perles and guaifenesin.
3. Zocor 40 mg daily.
4. Coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d.
5. Digoxin 0.125 daily.
6. Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d.
7. Azithromycin 25 mg daily.
8. Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily.
9. Combivent inhaler.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: DEANGELO MACK PEED MD
Ms. Mulready is a 90+-year-old woman with a history of coronary
artery disease including a non ST elevation MI in 4/13
medically managed , congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 25% and severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of
1.0 who was transferred from the Ime Tesion Hospital with shortness
of breath several days after discharge from that hospital where
she was treated for , a multilevel pneumonia and CHF exacerbation.
She had been hospitalized at Ham11 Eghe Torsa Health where she was treated for
pneumonia and after treatment had returned to her rehabilitation
facility/skilled nursing facility where she was not eating and
was found to be very tachypneic and diaphoretic and tachycardiac
for the three days prior to admission here. The night prior to
admission , she had been readmitted to Nordi Medical Center where she
was found to have a worsening CHF exacerbation with symptomatic
bradycardia with heart rate in the 20s. The patient received
diuresis , had a chest MRA to rule out pulmonary embolism , which
was negative and was transferred to Redd Hospital
for telemetry. The bradycardia was thought to have been from a
recent increase in the patient's Toprol XL dose. On admission ,
the patient was afebrile. Temperature 96.5 , pulse in the 70s and
80s , pressure 140/80 , breathing a 100% on four liters. Exam
significant for an awake , alert , pleasant older women , very hard
of hearing , decreased breath sounds with rhonchi right greater
than left and decreased breath sounds in the right middle lobe ,
poor inspiratory effort. Exam also significant for a hard
systolic ejection murmur , crescendo decrescendo heard best at the
right upper sternal border radiating to the carotids , also
audible at the apex. Her JVP was at 12 cm. She had no lower
extremity edema. Her labs were significant for a creatinine of
2.7 , a slightly elevated dedimer at Hen Mekend Medical Center , a chest x-ray that
showed a right middle lobe pneumonia that was resolving ,
cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: There was no evidence of acute ischemia. She
had a small elevation of her troponins in the morning after
admission thought secondary perhaps to CHF exacerbation or
chronic renal insufficiency. She was restarted on a very low
dose of Lopressor keeping atropine at her bedside in case of
symptomatic bradycardia. She did have a heart rate occasionally
in the 40s during this hospitalization , but was asymptomatic
throughout. In terms of her rhythm , in addition to the
asymptomatic bradycardia , she did have several runs of
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. These diminished with
repletion of magnesium and again were asymptomatic. The
electrophysiology was consulted and they did not feel that any
intervention was indicated given the asymptomatic nature of her
arrhythmias. In terms of her congestive heart failure
exacerbation was thought to be the primary reason for her
tachypnea and dyspnea. She was diuresed gently given her aortic
stenosis and tolerated well a net fluid loss of 500 to a 1000 cc
per day with great increase in her comfort breathing. Notably
she never had an increased oxygen requirement even when
tachypneic. We will do a dry weight before her discharge and
send her out on a dose of Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. with a dry
weight to be followed at the skilled nursing facility. She will
also have a follow up appointment with Dr. Erin Bahadue at
Oer Healthcare .
2. Infectious disease: On chest x-ray , the patient has a
persistent right middle lobe process an on the second day of her
hospitalization had increasing tachypnea , was found to be fluid
overloaded and was gently diuresed as mentioned earlier. Because
a recurrence of her pneumonia cannot be ruled out , we will
complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl , which was
added for the concern of aspiration to add anaerobic coverage.
3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency. The
patient's creatinine has improved during her hospitalization and
is currently 2.0. We have replaced her magnesium and put her on
a small dose of daily K-Dur 10 mEq per day to compensate for her
Lasix diuresis.
4. Neuro: The patient was seen by the speech and swallow
service. Their recommendations were mechanical , soft , solid diet
with thin liquids , out of bed at all meals.
The patient will be discharged on Flagyl to finish a 14-day
course , levofloxacin to finish a 14-day course. The patient's
levofloxacin should be taken until 1/29/03 and the patient's
Flagyl should be taken until 8/30/03 .  The patient will also be
discharged on the salicylic acid 81 mg , Phoslo 667 mg t.i.d. ,
Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , heparin was given for prophylaxis as an
inpatient , but she should be treated according to MVCMC policies ,
lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
multivitamin , simvastatin 20 mg q.h.s. , K-Dur 10 mEq x1 p.o.
q.d. , and Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d.
She will be discharged to the EH in good condition.
Thank you for the opportunity to care for this lovely patient.

Discharge Date: 8/8/2005
ATTENDING: BOENISCH , RAUL MD
DEATH SUMMARY: The patient was a 69-year-old female with a
history of coronary disease status post prior myocardial
infarction and surgery in 2002 who presented to R.healt Medical Center Emergency Department on 5/10/05 with three days
of chest pain and shortness of breath. Of note she had been
noncompliant with prior regimens and treatments and despite
diuretics started three days by her primary care physician she
reported new shortness of breath and chest pain at rest. An EKG
in the emergency department revealed widespread ST depressions.
She was treated for pulmonary edema with IV nitroglycerin , Lasix ,
aspirin , heparin , beta-blockers , and then she was taken urgently
to the cath lab where coronary angiography revealed a left main
coronary artery thrombosis with proximal and distal stenoses of
about 70% , 50% of her LAD , and 60% of her first diagonal. The
patient was transferred to the coronary care unit after placement
of an intraaortic balloon pump for further management and
evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
CHF , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , CAD , prior myocardial
infarction , restrictive lung disease , diabetes mellitus , chronic
renal insufficiency , morbid obesity , and iron deficiency anemia.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
Aspirin , hydralazine , nitroglycerin , quinine , Norvasc , Lasix ,
Toprol , lisinopril , albuterol , and famotidine.
ALLERGIES:
She was allergic to erythromycin , Bactrim , and IV contrast.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Noted no fever , chills , sweats , coughs , abdominal pain , nausea ,
or vomiting.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She was morbidly obese with moderate respiratory distress lying
at about 30-degree angle. Her O2 saturation was 97% on 3L nasal
cannula. Temperature was 99 degrees , pulse was 80 and regular ,
BP was 140/50 , and respirations about 20. Mucous membranes were
moist and intact. Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to
light. Her sclerae were anicteric. Her conjunctivae were pale.
She had a 15-cm of JVD with 2+ carotids without bruits. Coarse
breath sounds bilaterally with crackles two-thirds of the way up
the bases. Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm with 2/6
holosystolic murmur. Her abdomen was obese , soft , nontender , and
nondistended. She had no clubbing , cyanosis , or palpable edema.
She has 1+ distal pulses noted.
Her EKG was normal sinus rhythm with ST depressions in the
inferolateral leads and a right bundle-branch block was present.
Her chest x-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
consistent with edema. So the patient was admitted to the
coronary care unit and a consult with Cardiovascular Surgery and
serial crits were performed. The patient's condition continued
to deteriorate. She developed respiratory distress. Anesthesia
was called and her airway was secured via an emergent intubation.
The patient subsequently developed signs of abdominal pain and
presumed sepsis and ischemic bowel. She was brought to the
operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. Status post an
exploratory laparotomy the patient had a complex course in the
surgical ICU where she underwent multi-organ system dysfunction.
Her prognosis was very dire. This was explained to the family
and on 7/12/05 at 2:20 a.m. the family decided to withdraw care ,
which will be consistent with both the patient and family's
wishes and desires , and the patient was pronounced dead at 2:24
a.m. on 7/12/05 .

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Hello Mr. Lockner , it was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in
the hospital. As you know , you were diagnosed with heart failure and
atrial fibrillation. We helped you by getting rid of some excess fluid
from your lungs , and slowed your heart rate down. We also started you on
an antiarrhythmic ( amiodarone ) to try to convert you into sinus rhythm.
After discharge please continue taking your amiodarone. Also please
following these instructions: 1. ) Weigh yourself daily ( your current
weight is 200 pounds ). If you gain significant weight , especially within
one or two days ( e.g. >3-5 pounds ) this may be fluid building up in your
lungs. Please call your doctor. 2. ) Please taking measures to stop
smoking. 3. ) Please check your blood sugar everyday in the morning before
breakfast and record these values for your doctor. 4. ) Please see an
opthalmologist within 1-2 months for a check-up. 5. ) Please take Lasix 80
mg twice a day. 6. ) Please continue taking ezetimibe and pravastatin for
your cholesterol control. 7. ) Please see your primary care doctor , your
renal doctor , and your heart doctor soon. 8. ) Please take 6 mg Coumadin a
night and get your INR checked at the Free Medical Center Coumadin clinic on 7/11/06 .
They will then instruct you to change your dose accordingly. Your goal
INR is 2-3.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
1. ) Cardiology -- consider electric cardioversion in 4-6 weeks if still
not in sinus rhythm on amiodarone. Please check LFTs , PFTs , TFTs ( last
value 10/15/06 nl )
2. ) Primary care -- titrate hypoglycemics -- consider switching from
glyburide to glipizide given renal dyxfxn?
3. ) Coumadin -- goal INR 2-3 to be managed at SBMH coumadin clinic.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 63 year old woman
with ischemic cardiomyopathy who now
presents with fever , malaise , and rigors. In April of 1991 the
patient suffered an anterolateral myocardial infarction and was
treated with TPA. She had recurrent chest pain five days later and
was retreated with TPA without improvement and then underwent PTCA
of her left anterior descending artery. The left ventriculogram at
that time revealed an ejection fraction of 20%. This myocardial
infarction was complicated by pericardial tamponade and hypotension
treated with pericardiocentesis. She also subsequent to this had
suffered recurrent episodes of congestive heart failure and
ventricular tachycardia. An echocardiogram at this time revealed a
significantly decreased ejection fraction with a new left
ventricular aneurysm and moderate mitral regurgitation. She was
evaluated for cardiac transplant but opted for Amiodarone and
aneurysmectomy/AICD implantation. In February of 1991 a cardiac
catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 18%. The patient
was seen in cardiomyopathy clinic on 1/18/95 and complained of
chills and weakness and subsequent urinalysis was consistent with
urinary tract infection. She was started on Bactrim p.o. Since
then she has had increased nausea and vomiting with three episodes
of falling and imbalance. She denies dizziness , lightheadedness ,
palpitations , or chest pain. She denies fever or chills although
she had rigors in the emergency room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Ischemic cardiomyopathy. Hypertension.
Increased cholesterol. Diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease status post anterior myocardial infarction
complicated by ventricular tachycardia and congestive heart
failure. Left ventricular aneurysmectomy. AICD placement. Status
post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy. Status post cholecystectomy and
appendectomy.
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin , Cardene , Digoxin , Synthroid , Zocor ,
Captopril , Lasix , K-Dur , vitamin C , insulin , and
magnesium.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for brother who suffered a myocardial
infarction at the age of 50. She does not smoke
and does not drink alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a well appearing woman in no apparent
distress. Temperature 101.2 , pulse 77 ,
blood pressure 102/52 , oxygen saturation 91% on room air. The
examination was notable for lungs that had faint bibasilar rales.
The heart examination showed a regular rate and rhythm with S1 and
S2 and 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border
radiating to the left lower sternal border. Abdomen: Soft and
nontender. No hepatosplenomegaly. Back: No costovertebral angle
tenderness. Rectal: Guaiac negative. Extremities: No clubbing ,
cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Admission laboratory data was unremarkable.
Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure
and no infiltrates. The ECG was unchanged compared with previous
ECGs. The urinalysis was notable for too numerous to count WBCs.
The urine culture showed Escherichia coli.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and started on IV
antibiotics , specifically Ampicillin and
Gentamycin. She was gently hydrated. Over the next several days
she continued to improve although she still felt moderately weak.
Her urine cultures grew an organism which was sensitive to
Ampicillin and she was discharged on p.o. Ampicillin to follow-up
with her primary cardiologist , Dr. Clement Wittig , to document
resolution of her symptoms and to return to normal state of health.

Discharge Date: 4/18/1999
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 70 year old female with a
history of coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus , and peripheral vascular
disease who is status post a PTCA/stent of obtuse marginal 1 in
July of 1990 which restenosed and required rotablation and
restenting in January of 1998 who presents now with unstable angina.
The patient had increasing chest pain over the past month
progressing to pain at rest. The patient presented with substernal
chest pain to the emergency room department with a blood pressure
of 230/90. The patient's blood pressure was controlled with IV
Lopressor and the patient was admitted for rule out myocardial
infarction. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on
5/18/99 which revealed the following: A stent restenosis of left
circumflex artery , a 60 percent left anterior descending artery
stenosis , a 70 percent diagonal ostial stenosis , a 40 percent
ostial right coronary artery stenosis , and 95 percent ostial
posterior descending artery stenosis. No myocardial infarction was
noted and ejection fraction was approximately 50 percent
calculated. The patient was subsequently scheduled for coronary
artery bypass graft.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease. Hypertension.
Congestive heart failure. Type II diabetes
mellitus requiring insulin. Peripheral vascular disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE: On 8/17/99 the patient was brought to the
operating room and underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft times three with a left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
After surgery the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit in stable condition. On postoperative day #1 the patient was
extubated without incident.
On postoperative day #2 the patient experienced a period of atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and rates in the
150s. The patient was treated with IV Lopressor and Diltiazem drip
at 10 mg/hr. The patient subsequently converted spontaneously to
normal sinus rhythm. Postoperatively the patient continued to
experience hypertension with systolic blood pressures ranging from
160s to 190s. The patient was started back on Lopressor and
Captopril and gradually increased to preoperative doses. The
patient was also started back on Amlodipine for further blood
pressure control. The patient continued to experience brief
episodes of atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion to
normal sinus rhythm. The patient was followed by her cardiologist
postoperatively , Dr. Grunow . The patient was started on
anticoagulation with Coumadin. The patient's atrial fibrillation
continued to decrease in frequency and duration and , at the time of
discharge , the patient had been in normal sinus rhythm for greater
than 24 hours. The patient was seen by physical therapy service
and it was felt that the patient would benefit from rehabilitation.

ATTENDING: BOYD ENOCH GROTELUESCHEN M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Dizziness , blurred vision.
LIST OF OTHER DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure , coronary
artery disease , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and glaucoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 56-year-old man
with known coronary disease , congestive heart failure , and
diabetes mellitus , presenting with an episode of weakness and
blurry vision. The patient had a recent admission at Doyle Health Care Services 7/20/04 through 10/17/04 with malignant
hypertension and CHF. At that time , he had 3+ lower extremity
edema , a BNP of 1374 , and an ejection fraction of 20%. On echo ,
he was diuresed and lost 10 kg of fluid and was discharged to
follow up with the CHF Service. Since that time , he has been
maintained on 60 mg p.o. of Lasix , recently increased to 60 mg
b.i.d. , also with some recent increases in his Toprol XL and
amlodipine. The patient presented to the emergency department on
the day of admission with an episode of weakness and blurred
vision. He states that he was at work helping set up for a party
and he became somewhat week. His vision blurred and this
resolved when he sat down to rest. He reports having had one
similar episode approximately one month ago , for which he did not
seek medical care. He had no chest pain , no palpitations , no
shortness of breath , no fever or chills at home and in the days
prior to the episode had had good appetite and no complaints of
dysuria.
In the emergency department , his vitals were temperature 97.1 ,
pulse 70 , and blood pressure 147/68. The patient was
comfortable. An EKG revealed a question of ST changes and it was
noted that his creatinine was increased to 2.1 from his baseline
of 1.4 and then his blood glucose was 307. He was admitted in
order to rule out myocardial infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , coronary artery disease ,
congestive heart failure , hypertension , cognitive deficits , and
glaucoma.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION: Amlodipine 7.5 mg ,
Timoptic 0.5 one drop OU q.d. , aspirin 81 mg q.d. , Imdur 120 mg
q.d. , Zestril 50 mg q.d. , Toprol XL 150 mg q.d. , Lasix 60 mg
b.i.d. , glipizide XL 10 mg q.d. , and atorvastatin 40 mg q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for the fact that the patient lives with
his mother and works at Ondo Carmi Medical Center Cafeteria.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for vitals as above.
The patient's jugular venous pulsations were visible at less than
10 cm. His heart was regular with S1 , S2 , S4 , and no murmurs.
His lungs had bibasilar crackles , right greater than left. His
abdomen was soft , nontender. No hepatosplenomegaly. His
extremities were notable for no edema. Scattered excoriations
with quite long nails.
LABS AT ADMISSION: Notable for a potassium of 5.3 , blood glucose
of 307 , creatinine of 2.1 , white blood count of 7 , and hematocrit
of 42. BNP was 118. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 62 , left
atrial enlargement , left ventricular hypertrophy , and T-wave
inversions with ST changes in I , II , and V1 through V5. Chest
x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient ruled out for MI. He had no
complaints of chest pain at any time during his admission.
Initially , his Lasix and lisinopril were held in the context of
concern over possible hypotension as an etiology of his episode
of weakness. However , these were restarted on the second
hospital day at slightly diminished doses compared to his
baseline.
2. Renal: The patient's creatinine improved and at the time of
discharge , it was back to his baseline of 1.5.
3. Endocrine: The patient's diabetes mellitus is very poorly
controlled. At present , his hemoglobin A1c measured at admission
was 11.4 indicating an average blood glucose level of greater
than 300. While in-house , he continued to receive his baseline
dose of glipizide XL , however , he was also covered with regular
insulin on a sliding scale. The patient has no prior history of
insulin use at home. After consideration of the risks and
benefits of other oral agents including the high nature of his
hemoglobin A1c , it was decided that insulin therapy would be
necessary for adequate control of his diabetes. Various concern
over the patient's ability to successfully manage insulin therapy
at home and so , a simply regimen was selected. To begin with , he
was discharged on standing dose of 6 units of NPH in the morning
and 6 units at bedtime to be given via a prefilled disposable
insulin pen that will involve no need to draw up the medication
himself , but simply to select the correct dose and give the
injection.
4. Neuro: The patient's episode of blurred vision did not
recur. It is possible that his hyperglycemia accounted for this.
He did have an ophthalmologic exam one week prior to admission
that revealed no problems. He had no other neurologic or visual
symptoms during his stay in the hospital.
5. Fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient was somewhat
hyperkalemic at admission with a potassium of 5.3. This resolved
with a single dose of Kayexalate and his potassium returned to
normal levels. The patient was discharged in stable condition on
6/19/04 .  To receive close followup , he will have visiting
nurses' visits including two visits the day after discharge in
order to assist with insulin management and he has an appointment
with his primary care physician , Dr. Clifford Evanko , the day after
discharge on 5/6/04 .

Discharge Date: 9/13/2006
ATTENDING: SPIOTTA , GERMAN M.D.
SERVICE: General Medical Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Aspiration pneumonia.
PROBLEMS: Diabetes , atrial fibrillation , CHF , acute renal
failure , thrombocytopenia , elevated LFTs , agitation , aspiration
and rheumatoid arthritis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Vinzant is a 71-year-old woman
with severe obesity who was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory
failure from a rehabilitation facility for rapid shallow
breathing. On arrival in the emergency department , she was hypoxic and
hypoglycemic , responding to fluids , intubation , and transfer to the MICU. She
was subsequently transferred
out of the medical ICU to the general medical floor. Of note , she had a recent
admission to Th Medical Center for sepsis secondary to
cellulitis and pneumonia , enjoying that admission she developed
ATN secondary to antibiotic use. ROS on arrival to the medicine floor is not
possible , as the patient is disoriented
( at baseline ). She does report low back pain ( chronic ) , is moaning at baseline
( secondary to stroke/aphasia ) , but appears in NAD.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD , for which she uses BiPAP at home and no oxygen.
2. CHF , secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Ejection fraction
is 55% with no wall motion abnormalities. She does have a
history of elevated pulmonary artery pressures of 57 above rate
reduction.
3. Obstructive sleep apnea with Pickwickian syndrome.
4. Hypertension.
5. Sick sinus syndrome , status post pacemaker implantation in
2000.
6. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
7. Angina , status post septal MI.
8. Hyperlipidemia.
9. Diabetes type 2 , recently increased to insulin while on
stress dose steroids at her last hospitalization.
10. Osteoporosis.
11. Rheumatoid arthritis.
12. GERD.
13. Cellulitis , with a recent pneumonia.
14. Thrombocytopenia.
15. Iron deficiency.
16. CVA in 1998 with expressive aphasia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Fluconazole , prednisone 20 mg p.o.
daily , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily , aspirin , atorvastatin , Imdur ,
Lasix , Norvasc , lisinopril , atenolol , Advair , DuoNebs ,
multivitamin , folate , calcium , Lispro sliding scale , NPH insulin ,
senna , Colace and oxycodone.
ALLERGIES: None.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband who is her
Healthcare Proxy.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature 99.1 , heart rate
69 , blood pressure 149/77 with an oxygen saturation of 99% on
100% nonrebreather. Morbidly obese. HEENT examination is significant for fixed
left pupil secondary to surgery , with a pinpoint right pupil.
JVP cannot be assessed secondary to obesity. Pulmonary exam is
significant for diffuse rhonchi with wheezing. Cardiovascular
examination significant for a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left
lower sternal border. Extremities reveal 2+ pitting edema with
2+ pulses.
LABORATORY STUDIES: On admission were significant for sodium of
149 , BUN of 49 , creatinine of 2.3 , glucose of 21 , white count of 13 , hematocrit
of 34 , platelets of 63 , 000 , an alkaline phosphatase of 284 , ALT
of 82 , total bilirubin of 4.0 , direct bilirubin of 2.0 , albumin
of 2.5 and an INR of 2.1. CXR reveals a RLL pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Aspiration pneumonia. The patient was admitted with a right
lower lobe pneumonia. She grew MRSA in her sputum and was
treated with vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl. She did well
and was extubated on her first hospital day after arriving in the
MICU. However , she continued to aspirate and failed a bedside
swallow study in the MICU. She was stabilized and transported to
the medicine floor on overnight BiPAP. She again failed bedside
swallow evaluation with thin liquids , and was therefore started
on a very conservative pudding thick puree diet. She did
subsequently aspirate on secretions ( she was not eating at that
time ) and became acutely hypoxic with an ABG that showed a pH of
7.45 , pCO2 of 48 and a PO2 of 36. Her family was brought in and
it was explained that the patient was recurrently aspirating and
was critically ill. A family meeting was held , where it was
decided that the patient would be DNR/DNI , and every attempt
would be made to bring the patient home with hospice. She
actually stabilized from her acute event and was able to wean
from BiPAP to 3 L oxygen nasal cannula. Nevertheless , the
patient's family understood that her respiratory status remained
tenuous and that she would likely re-aspirate. She was
discharged home with hospice services per family request.
2. CHF. The patient diuresed greater than 26 liters during this
admission. Much of this diuresis was without pharmacological
intervention , although she did receive minimal Lasix support. At
the time of discharge , she was tending towards euvolemic or dry and was
not on any Lasix. She was felt to be in the polyuric phase of
ATN , which was resolving.
3. Diabetes. The patient was discharged on insulin NPH and a
sliding scale regular insulin. Her doses have been decreased
because she was found to be hypoglycemic on admission.
4. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. Given the patient's history
of bleeding ( she had a GI bleeding while in the MICU in the
setting of an INR of 2.0 ) , Coumadin was held. On review with the
medical team , it was felt that the risk of stroke was far
outweighed by the risk of a significant bleed. Therefore , the
patient is not discharged on Coumadin.
5. Acute renal failure. The patient was treated with
antibiotics prior to this admission , and developed ATN secondary
to that medication. Of note , her urine was positive for
eosinophils on admission. At the time of discharge , the
patient's creatinine was 2.1 , which in part was due to ATN and
also due to significant diuresis. Her baseline creatinine is 1.7
and she is currently trending downwards.
6. Thrombocytopenia. The patient is noted to have a chronic
thrombocytopenia. This was exacerbated with heparin products ,
which were discontinued. She did require platelet transfusions
for a platelet count of 34 in the setting of acute bright red
blood per rectum. However , her platelet count was stable at
greater than 125 on discharge.
7. LFT abnormalities. A right upper quadrant ultrasound was
within normal limits , although was of poor quality given the
patient's obese body habitus. She does have a possible
cholestatic picture , but the patient had no other symptoms.
Given her DNR/DNI status with hospice services pending , no
further workup was performed.
8. Agitation. The patient is , at baseline , mourning and
disoriented , but responsive. She did require Haldol and Ativan
p.r.n. , but also did well with 1 to 1 interaction. Morphine was
adequate for pain control.
9. Speech and swallow evaluation. The patient failed several
speech and swallow evaluations. She is put on a pudding thick
puree diet , but this is palliative , as she will very likely
aspirate even on this diet.
10. Rheumatoid arthritis. The patient was continued on
prednisone 20 mg q.a.m.
DISCHARGE EXAMINATION: Temperature 96 , respiratory rate 22 ,
pulse 68 , blood pressure 130/60 , oxygen saturation 99% on 3
liters. Exam is notable for morbid obesity , coarse breath
sounds , right greater than left , large ecchymosis of varying
stages particularly at subcutaneous injection sites , and baseline
disorientation , which is not different from the patient's usual
mental status.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON DISCHARGE: White count 11 , hematocrit 33 ,
platelets 214 , 000 , glucose 134 , sodium 148 , chloride 111 , BUN 40
and creatinine 2.1.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg q.2 h. p.r.n. ,

Discharge Date: 1/10/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HYPEROSMOLAR STATE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Rule in myocardial infarction , diabetes ,
hypertension , congestive heart failure , and
urinary tract infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Sal Sult is a 65 year-old
woman with a history of hypertension ,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , with a history of urinary
tract infections who noted cloudy urine five days previous to
admission with increased frequency but no dysuria. In clinic three
days prior to admission , the patient had greater than 10 to the 5th
colonies of E. coli in her urine culture. Since that time , she
developed left back pain , temperature to 100.0 , chills , nausea , and
vomiting x24 hours.
The patient presented to her primary medical doctor on the day of
admission with a temperature of 98.2 , a blood pressure of 128/54 ,
pulse to 112 , and finger stick equal to 521 with a white blood cell
count equal to 30 , and an anion gap equal to 15. Her sodium
was 128 , CO2 was equal to 20. The patient received one gram of IV
ceftriaxone and 5 units of regular insulin x2.

syncope , or palpitations. She also denied previous history of an
MI. The patient had had urinary tract infections previously
including an episode of pyelonephritis at age 7 , she denies a
history of kidney stones , she does take high doses of vitamin C.
Risk for coronary artery disease included age , family history ,
postmenopausal state , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and question
hypercholesterolemia. The patient had a positive stress test in
1997 , and was managed medically. She denied recent shortness of
breath or palpitations. Her last episode of chest pain was
reputedly one year previously , associated with stress of work and
for which she took nitroglycerin. She denied exertion related
chest pain but did admit to calf and ""hip"" pain with walking. She
denied buttock pain while walking. She denied previous history of

Sodium 135 , potassium 4 , chloride 97 , CO2 21 , BUN 29 , creatinine
1.6 , glucose 459. Acetest positive. White blood cell count 26.48 ,
hematocrit 41.3 , MCV 89.9 , platelets 278. White blood cell
differential with 81 polys , 13 bands , 4 lymphs , 2 monos. EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at 113 , axis equal to negative to 37 ,
intervals equal to 152/90/450 , as well as old Qs in V1 and V2 , left
anterior hemiblock , left ventricular hypertrophy. Chest x-ray
showed no infiltrate , no effusions , cardiomegaly , or pulmonary
edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's glucose came down quickly with IV
insulin and aggressive hydration. She
unfortunately ruled in for myocardial infarction with peak CK on
4/13/99 of 285 , and peak troponin of 6.15 for which she was
treated with beta blockers , aspirin , and heparin , as well as
Zestril and Zocor. She had some recurrent episodes of chest pain
during her admission following her non-Q wave myocardial
infarction.
She also had an echocardiogram on 4/13/99 which showed an ejection
fraction of 45% , and hypokinesis in the middle and distal
intraventricular septum. She had 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and
preserved right heart function.
On 1/12/99 , she underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a
40% osteo left main lesion and a 40% tapered distal lesion. Her
left anterior descending artery was diffusely diseased up to 50% in
its mid portion. The first diagonal had a discrete 70% stenosis ,
and the second diagonal had a discrete 90% stenosis. The right
coronary artery had a 40% discrete proximal stenosis , the posterior
descending artery had a osteo 90% stenosis. The right circumflex
had an 80% proximal stenosis.
The patient had an exercise stress test on 10/4/99 which was a
modified Bruce. The patient completed a 9 minute test with a
maximum heart rate of 100 , which was 65% of predicted. Her maximum
blood pressure was 156/60. She was asymptomatic with no ST changes
and remained in sinus rhythm. The test was therefore interpreted
as negative for ischemia.
It was thought that the patient would probably benefit from CABG
procedure but it was deferred secondary to patient preference , as
well as her infection. With regard to her infectious disease
issues , the patient was treated with levofloxacin. Her white blood
cell count was persistently elevated. She had one urine culture
which appeared contaminated and her blood cultures were negative
for this admission. She had a pelvic and abdominal CT on 2/1/99
which demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions , no evidence of
abscess , and punctate renal stones without evidence of obstructive
uropathy. Her fever resolved.
First it was thought that the patient did have a urinary tract
infection. She maintained relatively benign urinalysis , which was
collected only hours after she received ceftriaxone , it was
difficult to believe that she had ever had pyelonephritis. Because
of her persistently elevated white blood cell count was also
unclear although it did finally decline. In short , the series of
events that led up to her admission appeared likely to be urinary
tract infection leads to tachycardia and demand related myocardial
infarction , and then combination of infection and myocardial
infarction leads to nonhepatic hyperosmolar state. Nonetheless , a
different sequence of pathologies is also possible.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition.

Admitted , but never went upstairs as she was discharged from the
observation unit on 6/2/06 in the AM. She diuresed well to 120mg iv
lasix x1. Evaluated by Dr. Steinhouse , her outpatient cardiologist.
Likely gradual CHF exacerbation due to increased salt in diet and change
in medications. She was not taking maxzide-25 and remained on lasix 80mg
po bid lasix. She will now need to increase her lasix to 120mg po bix x2
days , then take 120mg po QAM + 80mg po QPM from now on. Strict daily
weights and low salt <2gm diet.
2 ) RUE DVT: She was still receiving lovenox injections 100 daily , but
apparently was supposed to complete a 2 week total course in February
according to the medical records available. Dr. Lotthammer believed it was okay
for her to stop as she has been on lovenox for approximately 4-5 weeks.
3 ) CODE: FULL. HCP: daughter Clair Mims 843-193-5920 , cell:
077-692-1935
4 ) DISPO: D/C to Morework Medical Center rehab facility. May need long-term nursing
home care in the near future. Dr. Hai Wisch is following her closely.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1 ) Please do strict daily weights. Call Dr. Renato Kushiner ( cardiologist )
for any reason including increases in weight. Also call him for updates a
few times a week.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath and failure to thrive.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 73-year-old gentleman with
end-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis , with ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% who was treated for C. difficile
colitis and worsening CHF. The patient has a long history of
ESRD secondary to hypertension and diabetes. He began
hemodialysis in January 2005. He also has a long history of
peripheral vascular disease status post right carotid
endarterectomy and bilateral external iliac angioplasty as well
as atrial fibrillation and a history of CVA diagnosed by MRI with
the timing unknown , thought to be secondary to thrombi from his
atrial fibrillation. This gentleman presented with worsening
shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion as well as worsening
dysphagia and anorexia on January , 2005. Apparently , he was in
good health or at least his usual state of health until April ,
2005 , when he was admitted to Aton Norran Rehabilitation Hospital Of for GU
symptoms which are unclear and a loss of appetite. He stayed
there for 30 days and then transferred to a rehabilitation
center. After being discharged there for 1 week , he developed
worsening shortness of breath and was unable to answer the door
when his neighbor knocked. The neighbor brought him into the ED
on January , 2005 , for acute shortness of breath , which the
patient described , has worsened over the past 3 to 4 days. He
has gone from being able to walk across his apartment to now only
being able to take 3 to 4 steps before becoming progressively
short of breath , and he now sleeps on three pillows. In fact , he
currently cannot even get through his HPI without 3- to 5-word
dyspnea. He denies any PND. Concerning for his dysphagia , he
feels like he first lost weight when he was trying to control his
volume status prior to hemodialysis initiation in early January
2005. His goal was to be 114 pounds and he limited his intake in
order to maintain that weight instead of limiting his volume.
About 2 months ago , he began losing his appetite. He states that
this was because of the ""his renal diet."" It was unclear if the
diet caused this loss of appetite or his loss of appetite was
prior to the diet. Over the past 3 weeks , he has noted
progressive difficulty in swallowing solid foods. He is able to
swallow liquids. Since discharge from rehabilitation a week
prior to admission , he is only able to take liquids. He quotes
he cannot even take noodles and soup. He has no nausea or
vomiting unless attempting to swallow solids and no abdominal
pain. His throat is sore and dry. He constantly wants water and
ice. Also concerning is the report , it is unclear , about a 20-
to 40-pound weight loss over the past 2 to 3 months. In the ED ,
he was afebrile; heart rate 105; blood pressure 136/70;
respirations 18; and 97% on room air. He was given Lopressor for
rate control for his atrial fibrillation. His EKG showed new T
wave inversions in the inferolateral leads and Q waves , which
were new for his baseline in the inferior leads. There was also
an S1 , Q3 , T3 , which was new but absent once his rate was
controlled.
The patient was admitted to the floor and briefly transferred to
the unit for refractory hypertension , though he was found to have
right subclavian stenosis and blood pressure was checked in the
left arm. His blood pressure was fine at 100 to 110 systolic.
He was then transferred back to the floor. An abdominal CT was
done on September , 2005 , which showed marked edematous colonic
wall beginning on the ascending colon all the way through to the
rectum. The differential diagnosis at this time was
pseudomembranous colitis versus ischemic bowel. His lactate
level was normal. He had a benign examination , and because of
the distribution and the past antibiotic use , it was felt that he
most likely had C. difficile , which was found to be culture
positive on August , 2005. He had an echocardiogram , which
revealed an EF of 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis and akinesis
as compared to an echocardiogram done at the outside hospital in
January 2005 with an EF of 30% to 35%. He had severe TR. On July , 2005 , while on hemodialysis , he had an episode of substernal
chest pain. Enzymes were sent and troponin peaked at 18. An EKG
showed ST depressions in V2 through V6 , which resolved with rate
control. He received aspirin and heparin and continued his
Lopressor and statin. The decision was made not to catheterize ,
as he was a poor candidate likely to have three-vessel disease
and not a surgical candidate. The patient made the decision with
the cardiologist , family , and the team. The patient was
scheduled for an EGD and colonscopy to evaluate his dysphagia and
colitis , but this was deferred secondary to the incident of the
non-ST-elevation MI on January , 2005. Subsequently , the patient
was managed medically for his worsening CHF and shortness of
breath with fluid removal at hemodialysis on Tuesdays , Thursdays ,
and Saturdays. The patient began Flagyl p.o. 500 mg t.i.d. on
January , 2005 , which should be continued through August ,
2005 , for a full 14-day course.
IMPRESSION: This is a 73-year-old man with acute worsening
shortness of breath in the setting of a 20-plus-pound weight
loss , increasing dysphagia , and progressive fatigue for the past
2 months. He was found to have Clostridium difficile colitis and
ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. His
course was complicated by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction
on January , 2005 , with a troponin peak of 18 , which was likely
demand ischemia from tachycardia in the congestive heart failure
setting. His EGD and colonscopy was postponed secondary to the
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The patient was managed
medically with fluid removal with hemodialysis for congestive
heart failure. He continues Flagyl p.o. for Clostridium
difficile treatment. He was transferred on July , 2005 , to a
rehabilitation facility.
PROBLEMS BY SYSTEMS:
1. Gastrointestinal: We are treating his C. difficile colitis
with p.o. Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. from January , 2005 , through
July , 2005. His stool did grow out Staphylococcus aureus ,
but this was likely from colonization from his mouth flora , and
therefore , we are not treating. Per ID consult , we are holding
all other antibiotics and treating only when cultures are
positive. He had a planned EGD and colonscopy , which was
postponed due to the NSTEMI on January , 2005. He should have a
scope done , both upper and lower , 2 to 3 months down the road
once the patient is stable. His LFTs were noted to bump on
July , 2005 , but now are trending down; that is likely
secondary to either shock liver or just his NSTEMI. Continue to
monitor them at rehabilitation. The patient is unable to swallow
solids and is currently on a full liquid diet. After EGD ,
consider barium swallow if nondiagnostic. The patient refuses NG
tube , so encourage p.o. intake. He will take Nepro if asked. He
should have at least 100 cc of Nepro a day.
2. Cardiovascular: CHF with an EF of 10% to 15% with global
hypokinesis compared to January 2005 EF of 30% to 35%. He has
severe MR and TR. He is on Lopressor 12.5 t.i.d. and captopril
12.5 t.i.d. with blood pressure tolerating well. He was started
on digoxin 0.25 three days a week on Sunday , Wednesday , and
Friday , and his current digoxin level is 0.9 on July , 2005.
He was wet on examination routinely and so it was taken off
between 1 to 3 liters at hemodialysis regularly. He had an
NSTEMI on January , 2005 , with troponin peak of 18 , likely demand
ischemia from CHF. Continue aspirin , beta-blocker , and statin.
We discontinued the heparin after 24 hours. A decision was made
not to catheterize , as he is a poor candidate likely to have
three-vessel disease. EKG currently shows Q waves inferiorly
with ST depressions in V3 through V4 and T wave inversions in V3
through V6. The depressions improved with rate control. He does
have a low blood pressure in the right upper extremity , which is
false due to a right subclavian stenosis; always check blood
pressures in the left arm. He has atrial fibrillation and he
used to be on diltiazem for rate control. He was on Lopressor
with good effect. He was restarted on his Coumadin dose at 4 mg
q.h.s. on July , 2005 , for anticoagulation. He is on
telemetry. He should be monitored of his INR for a goal INR of 2
to 3 for his atrial fibrillation and change of Coumadin as
accordingly.
3. Endocrine: Now on half-strength NovoLog sliding scale. He
has had trouble with hyperglycemia for the past several days.
His fingersticks can go up to 250. We think this is okay not to
cover , as when we choose to cover him , he dips down into the 40s.
4. Pulmonary: On admission , he had acute shortness of breath
and tachycardia. An EKG showed S1 , Q3 , T3. PE CT was negative.
There was no parenchymal disease. Some hilar lymph nodes were
noted. His repeated chest x-rays were every other day , which
only showed changes in the CHF status. There was routinely no
consolidation or interstitial disease seen. His last chest x-ray
showed bilateral pulmonary edema and that was on July , 2005.
5. Infectious Disease: We are only doing Flagyl p.o. for C.
difficile treatment. He should continue 500 mg t.i.d. p.o.
through August , 2005 , holding all other antibiotics. We
questioned if he is septic when his temperatures drop to 95 to
96 , but all blood , sputum , and urine cultures have been no growth
to date. You could consider a third generation cephalosporin if
a pneumonia develops.
6. Renal: Hemodialysis on Saturday , Tuesday , and Thursday.
7. Hematology: He has anemia. Panel workup with mixed picture
of iron and chronic anemia. We are repleting his iron with
vitamin C. He received 1 unit on October , 2005 , at
hemodialysis. His current hematocrit is 31. Guaiac stools have
been negative.
8. He has a malignancy workup , which has been negative so far.
He has a normal TSH , PSA , and free PSA. No mass is seen on
abdominal CT or chest CT.
9. Prophylaxis: He is on heparin subcutaneously and Nexium.
10. Disposition: He is going to rehabilitation today on February , 2005.
11. Code status: DNR/DNI.
12. Health care proxy: His brother , Son Gonzaliz ,
167-227-0450.
PLAN TO DO:
1. Hemodialysis on Tuesdays , Thursdays , and Saturdays.
2. Continue Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. from January , 2005 , to
August , 2005.
3. Follow INR for goal of 2 to 3 for atrial fibrillation , on
Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.h.s. currently.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.
headache; aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.; captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
t.i.d.; Peridex Mouthwash 0.12% b.i.d.; digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
every Sunday , Wednesday , and Friday; Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
t.i.d.; Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.; nystatin swish and swallow;
Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.p.m.; Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.; and Nexium 20
mg p.o. q.d. NovoLog sliding scale: If blood sugars are less
than 125 , give 0. Actually , give 0 until blood sugars are 251 to
300 , then give 2 units; 301 to 350 , give 4; and 351 to 400 , give
6. Also , ??___??.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: The patient was discharged , condition
stable.

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 57-yeare-old man with history of end-stage renal
disease , status post kidney transplant in 5/13 , aortic valve
replacement , coronary artery bypass graft , LIMA to LAD , in
7/7/005 , who is presenting here to the Otea Healthcare with worsening
lower extremity edema , shortness of breath , and decreased urine
output , and an increased creatinine from 3.3 the baseline to 5.3.
On admission , the patient did not report that the lower

baseline , however , he had developed some left upper extremity
edema as well as his lower extremity edema. He also described a
new shortness of breath on admission , a cough with whitish
sputum , no blood in his cough. He denied dyspnea on exertion ,
but did report being short of breath while lying flat , or
orthopnea. He did not describe any PND. He also reported a

before being presented to the emergency department. He also
described a decrease in his urine output one day prior to
admission and dysuria x2 days. The patient denied any nausea ,
vomiting , diarrhea , chest pain or pressure. No palpitations , and
no dyspnea on exertion.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

in 6/24 , left buttock ulcer , also followed by Plastic Surgery ,
hypertension , diabetes mellitus type II , congestive heart
failure , and hypercholesterolemia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Included CellCept 1000 mg b.i.d. , prednisone 20 mg daily ,
valacyclovir 400 mg daily , calcitriol 0.25 mcg daily , metoprolol
25 mg b.i.d. , Bactrim single strength daily , NPH 16 units q.a.m. ,

Nexium 20 mg daily , Colace 100 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily ,
multivitamin , and tramadol 50 mg q.i.d.
ALLERGIES:
He reports no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
His temperature was 97.7 , his heart rate was 93-97 , his
respiratory rate was in the 30s , his blood pressure was 167/90 ,
and his O2 saturation was 97-99% on 2 liters. In general , he was
in fairly significant distress. He had difficulty catching his
breath. His head and neck exam is significant for equal , round
and reactive pupils. No cervical lymphedema , and no icterus.
His JVP was up to about 12 cm. He did not have any carotid
bruits. His cardiovascular exam was significant for rate and
rhythm that were regular at 2/6 systolic ejection murmur and
heard best in the right upper sternal border. He did not have S3
or S4. His chest incision was clean , dry and intact. His
pulmonary exam was significant for crackles bilaterally about a
halfway up his back. His abdomen was soft , nontender , and
nondistended , with positive bowel sounds. Incision of the
abdomen was similarly clean , dry and intact. His extremities
were significant for 3-4+ lower extremity edema , significant
pitting to the thighs , and some dependent decubitus edema as
well. He had 2+ pitting edema in his left upper extremity. He
had a fistula on his right arm. He has a decubitus sacral ulcer
with a VAC dressing in place on admission. Neurologic exam was
significant for alert and oriented x3. His cranial nerves were
all intact. He had no focal deficits.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: Status post CABG and AVR. On
admission , we held the patient's anticoagulation for a possible
biopsy of his kidney. We continued his Lopressor at b.i.d.
dosing. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction. He
had four-beat runs of NSVT on the day of admission , which he did
not repeat after repletion of his electrolytes. He had chest
pain again on hospital day #3 overnight. He did not have any EKG
changes with his chest. He was given Lopressor x1 , he ruled out
once again. The pain that he had developed was thought to be
likely incisional and not cardiac. Pulmonary exam: The patient
developed acute worsening of pulmonary status while in the
observation area at the emergency department on admission on
hospital day #1. He had an increasing O2 requirement , worsening
pulmonary exam , and a chest x-ray that showed pulmonary edema.
He was not diuresing effectively with more than 360 mg with IV
Lasix , which was administered to him in the emergency department ,
so Renal was called urgently to see him in observation and he was
sent for urgent dialysis. At dialysis , they removed greater than
4 liters of fluid and the patient was patient was symptomatically
improved. He did continue to have lower extremity edema
post-dialysis and an oxygen requirement of 2 liters nasal cannula
to maintain his oxygen saturation. He was given IV Lasix 80 mg
x1 on hospital day #4 with excellent urine output. His lower
extremity edema improved significantly after hospital day #4.
2. Renal: On admission , the patient's creatinine was 5.3. It
peaked at 6.6 and trended down to 5.1 with clear signs of
improvement. On admission , there was no improvement in his urine
output with large doses of IV Lasix , however , and Renal was
consulted to clarify whether this was an acute rejection versus
ATN from toxic doses of cyclosporin. In the emergency
department , he was given one dose of Solu-Medrol 500 mg , however ,
he was found to have elevated cyclosporin levels at 679 , so this
was thought to be the likely cause of his acute renal failure and
his cyclosporin was temporarily held. Since that time , on his
hospital day #1 , his cyclosporin levels trended down to the point
at which there were just slightly over 100 on hospital day #3 and
cyclosporin was reinitiated at lower doses. He was dialyzed on
admission with removal of 4 liters of fluid , CVM , BK , and LDH
were sent from dialysis. His creatinine improved , so further
dialysis and biopsy were deemed unnecessary.
3. ID status: The patient presented with UTI on admission.
This was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg x1 and then 250 mg
q.48h. for a course of seven days. Blood cultures grew 4/4
Gram-negative rods , and the patient was diagnosed with urosepsis.
After dialysis , the patient was treated with ceftriaxone 1 g
daily and continued on levofloxacin 250 mg q.4-8h. Transplant
and Infectious Disease was consulted who recommended ceftriaxone
be discontinued and the levofloxacin to be continued for two
weeks after discharge with repeat cultures. HSV swap from sacral
wound was sent. These repeat cultures and HSV swab were all
negative , and levofloxacin was continued for two weeks
postdischarge.
4. FEN: We held the patient's fluids. We checked his I's and
O's on a daily basis with daily weights. His hyperkalemia on
admission was 6.1 , resolved with Kayexalate , insulin and D50
meds. He was given additional Kayexalate when he came up to the
floor and his K resolved , backed down to his normal range. The
patient was kept on a renal and cardiac diet. His albumin and
total protein were low , so a nutritional consult was called ,
which optimized his nutritional status.
5. Endocrine: The patient had a tight glycemic control on NPH
16 units q.a.m. and 19 units q.p.m. , NovoLog 6 units q.a.c. with
sliding scale , and the patient's sacral decubitus ulcer had a VAC
dressing in place on admission. Plastics was called to address
his VAC. They took down the VAC due to some leakage on admission
and he was treated with 1/4 Dakin's solution and wet-to-dry
dressing t.i.d. On discharge , he continued on the wet-to-dry
dressings. He will be followed as an outpatient VNA , and will
have the VAC replaced by the VNA as an outpatient. His
hematocrit was stable throughout his hospital stay.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on Nexium throughout his
hospital stay and we held his anticoagulation for possible
biopsy. He will resume his outpatient anticoagulation and INR
checks with his INR Follow-Up Clinic. He was able to leave the
floor for cigarettes , and he signed an agreement suggesting that
he was going to tolerate the risk of leaving the floor for short
period of time even while on telemetry.
On discharge , his medications included calcitriol 0.25 mcg p.o.
daily , Colace 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin 16 units q.a.m. , 18
units q.p.m. , ketoconazole 200 mg daily , Lopressor 25 mg t.i.d. ,
prednisone 20 mg q.a.c. , cyclosporin 125 mg b.i.d. , tramadol 50
mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. for pain , Bactrim single strength one tablet
p.o. daily , CellCept 1000 mg b.i.d. , valacyclovir 500 mg daily ,
levofloxacin 250 p.o. every other day x2 weeks , NovoLog 6 units
q.a.c. , Neoral 125 mg b.i.d. , and aspirin 325 mg daily.
The patient was discharged to home in stale condition.

Discharge Date: 5/2/2001
CHIEF COMPLAINT: DYSPNEA ON EXERTION AND LOWER EXTREMITY SWELLING.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old male with
history of diabetes and ischemic
cardiomyopathy who presents on 11/26/01 with increased shortness of
breath and fatigue. His cardiac history began in 1980 , when he
suffered from an myocardial infarction and had a second myocardial
infarction in 1986. He had a 3 vessel coronary artery bypass graft
in 1987 with a LIMA-left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft
to OM and saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The patient developed
decreasing functional status postoperatively and recent
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15%.
In October 2000 , Mr. Straight was admitted to the Luke's Medical Center with chief complaint of dyspnea on exertion and
fatigue. Cardiac catheterization at that time showed native 3
vessel disease with occlusion of his venous graft to his obtuse
marginal and posterior descending arteries. On that admission , Mr.
Etling was aggressively diuresed and post discharge , he was able to
complete his normal activities of daily living with no shortness of
breath or chest pain. Over the several months prior to admission ,
however , Mr. Knoeppel noted progressive worsening of shortness of
breath , dyspnea on exertion and fatigue , such that , on the day of
admission , he reported that he could not walk from his driveway to
his house without symptoms. He reported no baseline orthopnea , but
states he does have paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
history of gallstones , hypothyroidism ,
nephrolithiasis , cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant only for the coronary artery
bypass graft in 1987.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of an myocardial infarction in his
50s. His mother also died of an myocardial
infarction in her 70s.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Captopril 37.5 t.i.d. 2. Isordil
30 t.i.d. 3. Digoxin .125 q. day. 4.
Synthroid .25 q. day. 5. Lipitor 20 q. day. 6. Torsemide 80
b.i.d. 7. Coumadin 4 mg Monday/Wednesday/Friday , 5 mg other days.
8. NPH 40 units b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature 97 , pulse 69 ,
blood pressure 100/70 , respiratory rate 16 ,
satting 92% on room air. Neck examination revealed jugular venous
pressure , elevated behind the ear and approximately 27 mm with
positive hepatojugular reflux. The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular examination revealed
regular rate and rhythm with frequent ectopy , positive S3 and PMI
in the midaxillary line. Abdomen was benign. Extremities showed
no lower extremity edema with 1+ distal pulses and warm to the
touch.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant for a sodium of 146 , BUN 16 ,
creatinine 1.3 , hematocrit 36 , INR 1.4.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 67 with left axis deviation ,
right bundle branch block and Q-waves in leads 2 , 3 and AVF.
Chest x-ray revealed no pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiology Ohio
service for diuresis and possible inotrope
support. He was diuresed over the course of 10 days using
Torsemide 80 mg IV t.i.d. and his Captopril was gradually increased
as tolerated to a maximum dose of 75 mg t.i.d. The patient
diuresed without difficulty and by the time of discharge , he had
weighed a dry weight of approximately 96 kilograms.
The patient was also evaluated for possible heart transplant.
Work-up was extensive and included an echocardiogram on 11/20/01 ,
which showed an ejection fraction of 15-20% with global hypokinesis
and akinesis of the inferior septal walls with moderate mitral
regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Abdominal
ultrasound on 11/20/01 , revealed probable cardiac cirrhosis. A
liver spleen scan on 10/1/01 , was consistent with mild cardiac
cirrhosis , as was an MRI of the liver on 4/24/01 .  As a result ,
the patient was not considered a candidate for transplant.
Pulmonary function tests on 4/10/01 , revealed a DLCO = 14 , which
was 49% of expected. On 3/20/01 , the patient underwent a
dobutamine MIBI stress test that was consistent with a moderately
enlarged area of prior myocardial infarction of the left circumflex
territory and posterior descending artery territories. The
examination was also suggestive with an area of modest dobutamine
induced ischemia in the territory of the left anterior descending
with preserved viability.
Endocrine wise , the patient's diabetes was managed in-house on a
regular insulin sliding scale. Because his hemoglobin A1C level
was below 6 on discharge , he was placed back on his regiment of NPH
40 units b.i.d. In terms of his thyroid , we made no adjustments to
his Levoxyl regiment. He has been coumadinized for a low ejection
fraction and was discharged on his regular regiment of 4 mg
Monday/Wednesday/Friday and 5 mg on all other days.
The patient also has a history of depression and he was maintained
on Prozac 20 mg q. day.
Hematologically , the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 36
during his hospitalization. His MCV = 75.1 in a 61-year-old male
with necrocytic anemia. We obtained a colonoscopy which revealed
polyps , all of which were snagged with no complications. The
pathologies are currently pending.
The patient was discharged on 7/15/01 , having diuresed to a dry
weight of 96 kilograms and plan to follow-up with Dr. Goltra on
7/30/01 .

Discharge Date: 5/30/2003
ADMIT DIAGNOSES: 1. HEART FAILURE.
2. DIABETES MELLITUS.
3. HISTORY OF CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT.
4. ASTHMA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year-old woman
with history of dilated cardiomyopathy
and estimated ejection fraction of 35 to 40% who presented with
lower extremity edema , weakness , fatigue , and syncopal episodes x
2. At baseline the patient states that she is able to walk and
perform her activities of daily living without symptoms of heart
failure. Per patient , about five days prior to admission , she
began to notice increasing lower extremity edema , rapidly spreading
from her calves up to her thighs. She also noted symptoms of
weakness and fatigue. On 9/29/03 the patient reported two syncopal
episodes- the first of which was preceded by dizziness after which
she lost consciousness after lying down. She awoke and walked to
her apartment where she apparently lost consciousness a second time
although she does not remember having any prodromal symptoms prior
to the second episode. The patient was found by her neighbor and
taken to the Niry Hospital .  At Labi Straubll Hospital ,
the patient was treated for heart failure with diuresis with IV
Lasix. An echocardiogram at the Malvfi Hospital showed an ejection
fraction of 10 to 15% , 4+ mitral regurgitation , 3+ tricuspid
regurgitation. The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction and
ECG showed no ischemic changes. The patient did have one run of
11-beat non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Liver function
tests were noted to be elevated. Her hepatitis panel was
reportedly negative. The patient was transferred from Got Center
to Towhiddle Amentcon Pal Medical Center as her primary care physician and
cardiologist are at Oten Memorial Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypotension. History of cerebrovascular
accident. Type II diabetes mellitus.
Asthma. Dilated cardiomyopathy.
MEDICATIONS: On transfer , Albuterol inhaler , Flovent inhalers ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Reglan 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals , Colace , iron , Captopril 50 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH 35 units q.a.m. and
q.p.m. , Humalog sliding scale , Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. , and
Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n.
LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 1.3. WBC normal. TSH was normal at
2.1 , ESR 8. ECG showed sinus rhythm , left atrial
enlargement , left ventricular hypertrophy , no ischemic changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular: The patient has a dilated
cardiomyopathy and was admitted with volume
overload. The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix throughout her
hospital course with successful diuresis of 1 to 2 liters of fluid
per day. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20 to
25% , severe global hypokinesis , moderate mitral regurgitation , and
moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Right and left heart
catheterization was performed. The right heart catheterization
showed the following: Right atrial pressure was 8 , right
ventricular pressure 35/5 , PA pressure 37/17 , and wedge pressure of
15. The left heart catheterization showed two vessel coronary
artery disease , no obstructive lesions. The patient showed marked
clinical improvement with diuresis with IV Lasix. Prior to
discharge the Lasix was changed from IV to p.o. and the patient was
stable on p.o. regimen of Lasix prior to discharge. The left heart
catheterization , as noted above showed moderate coronary artery
disease. The patient was continued on statin for this reason. The
patient had had two syncopal episodes prior to admission along with
a run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia at the outside
hospital. This raised the concern along with her low ejection
fraction that she could be having arrhythmias causing syncope. On
telemetry during this admission , the patient was noted to have
additional runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia along with
an episode of complete heart block. The electrophysiology service
was consulted and placed an ICD and pacer on 11/25/03 .  This
procedure was well tolerated.
Renal: The patient was noted to have low albumin on admission and
protein in her urine , concerning for nephrotic syndrome. Renal
consult was obtained. The 24-hour urine was collected. Renal
ultrasound was negative for hydrosis or renal vein thrombosis. An
SPEP and UPEP were sent which are pending at the time of this
dictation. The renal consult felt that the diabetes mellitus was
the likely explanation for the protein wasting in the urine. The
patient was continued on an Ace inhibitor.
Infectious disease: The patient was noted to have a localized area
of infection at the area of old IV site on admission. She was
started on p.o. dicloxacillin to treat this infection. Surgery was
consulted and ruled out septic thrombophlebitis.
Hematology: The patient was taken off Coumadin on admission but
was continued on heparin for anticoagulation. The Coumadin was
restarted after the pacer and ICD were placed.
Endocrine: The patient was treated on a regimen of Lentes and
insulin sliding scale. Her blood sugars were stable on this
regimen.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient will planned to
be discharged on the following medications:
Dicloxacillin 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.hs. , Lentes 40
units subcu q.hs. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , and Keflex 25 mg p.o. q.i.d.
FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr.
Avary . She will follow-up with her cardiologist , Dr. Dobies , on
3/3/03 .  She will have a repeat echocardiogram in July to
reassess her ejection fraction and valvular disease.

Discharge Date: 4/22/2003
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 67-year-old man with a
history of coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass grafting , mitral valve
replacement with previous history of endocarditis in April 2002
who presents with severe back pain. The patient was well until
Friday before admission when he drove 2 1/2 hours to Coln As Las
and he had some back stiffness. The following day the patient
noted back pain , took some Tylenol but remained ""stiff all day"".
On the following day , Sunday , he appeared better , able to tolerate
walking well. On Monday he again had severe pain , came to the
emergency department here at Ux Erla A Hospital where he
had a CT of the spine and chest without evidence of abnormalities.
He was discharged to home with Percocet. On the morning of
admission the patient was again with pain. He was urged by his
cardiologist to come to the emergency department to rule out
epidural abscess , work up for cause of back pain. He was negative
for any fever or chills. No bowel or bladder incontinence. No
radiation of pain down the legs.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative except for HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.0 , heart rate 78 , blood
pressure 160/80 , respiratory rate 20 , satting 95% on
room air. GENERAL: The patient was sitting in the stretcher ,
comfortable but with pain upon movement. HEENT: Pupils are equal
and reactive to light. Mucous membranes moist. Oropharynx is
clear. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm with a mechanical
S1 and S2. PULMONARY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with
trace bibasilar crackles. ABDOMEN: Obese , nontender ,
nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Warm and well
perfused. 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Intact.
Lower extremities limited by pain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass grafting , status
post myocardial infarction , mitral valve replacement with a St.
Jude valve , congestive heart failure , history of endocarditis ,
history of hypercholesterolemia , status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Amiodarone 200 mg q day , digoxin 0.125
mg q day , Imdur 30 mg q day , Captopril
50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Toprol 50 mg q day , Lipitor 80 mg q day ,
Coumadin 3 mg po q day , Levoxine 75 mg q day , Lasix p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife.
FAMILY HISTORY: Non-contributory.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for a white blood cell count
of 11.17 , hematocrit of 44.6 ,
platelet count of 129 , with 27 lymphocytes , 55 neutrophils , D-dimer
278.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 67-year-old male with a history of mitral valve
replacement complaining of severe back pain with
Streptococcus endocarditis in 2002 admitted of thoracic back pain
for four days. The pain progressed to the point where the patient
had difficulty ambulating secondary to the pain. CT scan of the
thoracic and lumbar spine on May , 2003 were negative for
abscess. The patient had no fevers. His admission exam was benign
with no aortic insufficiency and normal neurological exam. There
was variable pain to palpation over the ribs with no pain to
palpation over the spine. The patient was managed conservatively
with Oxycodone , Motrin and Baclofen. He was initially admitted to
GMS , and troponin was initially positive at 0.12 and then became
negative.
1. Infectious disease: Blood cultures drawn on March , 2003
grew 2/2 bottles of gram positive cocci in clusters and pairs. Due
to concern for prosthetic valve endocarditis or potential epidural
abscess , the patient was transferred to cardiology. Infectious
disease consult was obtained. Vancomycin and gentamicin were
started on March , 2003. On October , 2003 a transesophageal
echocardiogram was negative for vegetation. A MRI of the spine was
negative for osteomyelitis , epidural abscess however the MRI did
show severe degenerative joint disease possibly causing the
patient's back pain. The patient has had numerous positive blood
cultures for Streptococcus sanguous ( Viridans group ) , blood
cultures were last positive on March , 2003 with a negative work
up including a negative transthoracic echocardiogram and negative
transesophageal echocardiogram , negative chest CT x 2 , negative
abdominal CT ( which did show a small liver cyst ) , negative tagged
white blood cell count scan and a negative back MRI. Dental
consult saw no abscesses thus no evidence of a large septic source
from the mouth although this particular bacteria raises suspicion
for an oral source. Repeat films and dental evaluation on November , 2003 required the patient to get teeth cleaning as an
outpatient. There is a question of some seeding from bleeding gums
that occur about once weekly while the patient is brushing from
poor dentition and gum care. The dentist recommended deep cleaning
as an outpatient with prophylactic antibiotics. the patient was
initially started on gentamicin , vancomycin , on October , 2003
switched to gentamicin and penicillin. He will complete a 2 week
course of gentamicin and penicillin G on November , 2003. At that time
on August , 2003 the patient should start a 4-week course of
ceftriaxone 1 gram q day. PICC line was placed on August , 2003
to provide long term access for antibiotics.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was continued on Toprol , Imdur ,
switched from Captopril to Lisinopril. Rhythm: The patient was on
amniocentesis , digoxin , Coumadin for St. Jude valve and paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. CT and MRI is negative. Pain significantly
improved on January , 2003. The patient was on Neurontin and
OxyContin and oxycodone and Motrin , may benefit from restarting on
Baclofen if pain not well controlled on this regimen or persists
outside the treatment of endocarditis.
3. Endocrine: Continue on Synthroid.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: Insurance does not cover home
antibiotics so the patient will be
discharged to a skilled nursing facility for intravenous
antibiotics likely to the O Hospital on August ,
2003.
TO DO PLAN:
1. Follow the patient's INR closely while on Motrin and
antibiotics , in the past when on antibiotics his INR has been
difficult to control , goal range for the patient should be
around 2.8 to 3.5 and his Coumadin was increased from 3-4 mg
on August , 2003 given that his INR was trending downward to
2.0 on January , 2003.
2. Complete a 14-day course of penicillin G , gentamicin on November ,
2003 then complete additional four seeks of ceftriaxone
starting on August , 2003 to be completed on July , 2003.
3. The pain is likely secondary at least partially to
degenerative joint disease with some contribution possibly
from an infectious source but unlikely. Should titrate the
pain medications down as tolerated.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q day , digoxin
0.125 mg p.o. q day , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Motrin 400-600 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. for back or
musculoskeletal pain take with food , Synthroid 75 mcg p.o. q day ,
oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q 4-6h p.r.n. pain hold if somnolent or
respiratory rate less than 12 , Senna tablets two tablets p.o.
b.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q day , Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q day , Imdur
30 mg p.o. q day , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. q day , Prilosec 40 mg p.o. q
day , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q day , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
gentamicin sulfate 110 mg IV q 12h x six days , penicillin G 3
million units IV q 4h x six days , Ceftriaxone not to be started
until August , 2003 for 28 day course ending July , 2003 1000 mg
intravenously q day , OxyContin 30 mg p.o. q 12h x seven days.
FOLLOW UP: The patient should follow up with Dr. Jefferey Mero ,
cardiologist at Blackci Medical Center who knows
the patient well and who also will follow his INR levels once
discharged from the rehabilitation center.

Hospital Course.
( 1 ) CV: The patient was admitted with dyspnea and chest pain. On exam ,
he was in volume overload with episodic atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response. At time of admission , he admitted to recent
dietary indiscretions. Of note , his digoxin level at time of admission
was also less than assay , suggesting medication noncompliance. He was
ruled out for MI by serial ECG and enzymes. His dyspnea/chest pain was
associated with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and
improved with rate control and diuresis. He was digoxin loaded and
aggressively diuresed to a weight of 140.7 kg. On day of discharge ,
his breathing was back to baseline and he appeared euvolemic by exam.
He will be discharged on coumadin for his atrial fibrillation/history
of PE. As his INR was 1.9 at time of discharge , he will not be
discharge on a lovenox bridge but will need to follow-up in 2 days for
an INR check. He will follow-up with Dr. Youmans , Dr. Elke ( his new
PCP ) , and the cardiology anticoagulation service.
( 2 ) PSYCH: The TM team was consulted for his nicotene addiction and
made referrals for him to the smoking cessation program at the Johour Memorial Hospital .
Pyschiatry was consulted , and they recommended resuming celexa. In
addition , he was sent up to see a psychiatric social worker for
counseling.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please call your primary care doctor if you should develop worsening
shortness of breath or weight gain.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable

Urinalysis was pending. EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 123 ,
positive PVCs , left axis deviation , nonspecific T wave inversion
AVL , V5 , V6. Chest x-ray showed a very dilated heart , prominent
hila , increased PVR , no effusions. AICD lead seen in right
ventricle.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1. Congestive heart failure. The patient has
clear evidence of left and right systolic
dysfunction. Patient with known cardiomyopathy , may have had
worsening of function with recent viral upper respiratory
infection. No clear dietary indiscretions. Begin Lasix drip ,
strict Is and Os , daily weights , low salt diet , cardiac monitor ,
check echo. 2. Abdominal pain. May have food poisoning on
Sunday. Also may have gastritis or pancreatitis. Right upper
quadrant pain may be secondary to congestive heart failure.
3. History of hypothyroidism. Check TSH.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiomyopathy service , Dr. Jim Gerardot ,
attending , began following patient on the first
hospital day. It was felt that the Lasix drip was ineffective and
recommended starting 200 mg IV Lasix t.i.d. with the goal of
keeping the patient 1.5 to 2.5 liters negative per day. The
patient had difficulty with repletion of potassium during the
entire hospital stay. Patient does not tolerate well either the
immediate release oral form of potassium or the IV form. The IV
form hurts the IV site and the oral form makes him nauseous , but he
still prefers the oral form. Over the course of the admission , 10
mg p.o. twice daily of slow released potassium was started and ,
eventually , was 30 mg twice daily at the end of his stay.
Captopril was added to the regimen at 12.5 mg three times a day on
the second hospital day and was eventually raised to 50 mg three
times a day as his blood pressure tolerated , which took four days.
Creatinine remained stable throughout admission and did not affect
our ability to diurese with Lasix. After six days , the patient was
adequately diuresed. JVP was now not visible. Lungs were clear.
There was no edema. The patient is tolerating captopril well.
Coumadin , which had been 4 mg per day on admission , was cut to 2 mg
per day because of the high INR on admission. Two days prior to
discharge , INR fell to 1.9. Patient was restarted on 4 mg per day.
At discharge , INR was 1.7. Patient does not wish to stay to have
INR corrected. VNA has been arranged to administer Lovenox and to
check PT , PTT over the next few days until this normalizes to a
therapeutic level.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.125
mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 160 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.d. , Compazine 10
mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea.
Patient is being discharged home with VNA services. He will follow
up with Dr. Scottie Fowles on 11 of May at 9:20 A.M.

Discharge Date: 10/16/2004
ATTENDING: MILFORD WIZWER M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 36-year-old man with a history of a familial
cardiomyopathy , ejection fraction estimated at around 15% with
marked left and right chamber enlargement , severe mitral
regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and PA pressures of 51
plus right atrium , as per an echo in 2003. He was also status
post ICD placement in 2001. At baseline , he has a one staircase
exercise tolerance before becoming short of breath. He also
admits that he has been having increasing orthopnea and
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He denies , chest pain ,
palpitations , or peripheral edema. He also has a history of
dietary fluid intake and medications noncompliance leading to
heart failure exacerbations. Currently , he states that he has
been eating ""salty foods , "" and has been drinking a lot of extra
fluids because he has been feeling dry and is not always taking
his medications. Consequently , he has noticed a worsening in his
exercise tolerance , worsening orthopnea , and most notably an
increase in abdominal girth. Because of these symptoms
consistent with decompensated heart failure , his physicians
suggested that he be admitted to the hospital for management of
his decompensated heart failure. Of note , he has been previously
on a transplant list , but has been delisted given his
noncompliance and continuation of tobacco use.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
In addition to the cardiomyopathy is chronic renal insufficiency
with the creatinine ranging from 1.2 to 3.5 at times.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Aldactone 25 mg once a day , K-Dur 40 mEq once a day , lisinopril
2.5 mg once a day , Isordil 20 mg three times a day , digoxin 0.125
once a day , torsemide 200 mg twice , and metolazone p.r.n. for
volume overload.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
As mentioned , he is smoking one-half per day of cigarettes ,
occasional alcohol use , no IV drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY:
His mother , his brother , and his cousin and nephew all have the
familial cardiomyopathy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On the day of admission , he presented with the JVP in the 18 to
20 range on the physical examination with positive HJR. His
cardiac exam had a positive S3 of laterally displaced PMI with
the right ventricular heave. He also had a 2/6 systolic murmur.
His abdomen was distended , nontender , but likely with ascites and
palpable liver edge. His extremities were warm without edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
From the cardiac standpoint , we initially attempted to diurese
him IV torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. However , he did not respond well
enough to this regimen , and therefore we started drip with
Zaroxolyn p.r.n. We also stopped his Isordil and ACE inhibitor
early on because of blood pressures in the 80s. On admission ,
his creatinine was 2.0 and on the next day of admission , it was
2.2 with low blood pressures , at which point , we decided to start
a low-dose dopamine drips at 2 mcg per hour. However , his urine
output was only about 500 cc negative , so we further increased
the Lasix drip from 10 mg an hour to 20 mg an hour after 200 mg
IV Lasix bolus. On this combination of the Lasix drip at 20 an
hour and dopamine at 2 mcg per hour , he began to have very good
and effective urine output at approximately 2-3 liters per day ,
negative , also reflected in his total weight , and came in with
admission weight of around 90 kg. On each day , he diuresed about
an half to kilo off until the day of discharge , at which point ,
he was less than 86 kg. We monitored strict I's and O's , checked
daily weight. During the course of his diuresis , his sodium
levels were decreasing mostly secondary to the patient drinking a
lot of free water. The combination of free water intake in the
setting of natriuresis resulted in further worsening of his
hyponatremia from an admission sodium of 128 to 124 , eventually
to 122. We strictly reinforce the need to limit his fluid intake
to less than 2 liters per day , and at that point , his sodium
levels than rebounded to 124 and also 128 on the day of
discharge. We monitored the b.i.d. lytes. Eventually , his blood
pressures remained stable. His JVP decreased from 18 to 20 on
admission to about 10 to 12 and continued to have good urine
output , thus we weaned off the dopamine , but continued the Lasix
drip for one more day. We then discontinued the Lasix drip and
transitioned him back over to torsemide 200 b.i.d. p.o. , which
was his home regimen and watch him for another 24 hours. He
continued to diurese at this dose , but then on the day of
discharge , his I's and O's were finally about 500 cc negative ,
which is a change from about 1 to 2 liters negative per day. His
JVP was about 9 to 10 and his creatinine was stable at 1.7. We
re-added his Isordil at 10 mg t.i.d. for the last 24 hours and
his blood pressures were stable in the 90s. Given his potassium ,
which was always borderline low in the 33 or 35 range , we decided
to increase his Aldactone dose to 25 mg b.i.d. , but given his
underlying renal insufficiency , we have decreased his standing
K-Dur from 40 mEq a day to 20 mEq a day. An echo was done , which
showed an ejection fraction of 20% and 4+ MR. They did not
comment on the synchrony on the preliminary report. However , he
is a candidate for Bi-V pacing given his mildly widened QRS
complex stage III heart failure and having been on a very good
heart failure regimen up until this point.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
At discharge , his medical regimen consisted of digoxin 0.125 mg
once a day , torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. , Aldactone 25 mg b.i.d. ,
Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , and K-Dur 20 mEq. We also added folate 5
mg to his regimen because he had an elevated homocystine level.
He also takes Ambien at night p.r.n. for insomnia.
DISPOSITION:
He is being discharged to home with plan to follow up with Dr.
Grassi in her Thyroid Clinic on 3/1/05 .  He has been again urged
to stop smoking and to be complaint with his regimen because he
is a good heart transplant candidate and for the current time , he
is not listed given the aforementioned reasons. Overall , Mr.
Plagmann states that his symptoms have drastically improved. He
no longer has orthopnea. He is able to exert himself much more
without symptoms of shortness of breath or lightheadedness , and
he is eager to go home

Discharge Date: 9/21/1998
SERVICE: Lesta Memorial Hospital .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Myocardial infarction. 2. Non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus. 3. Chronic renal insufficiency. 4.
History of renal carcinoma.
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES: 1. Cardiac catheterization on August , 1998.
2. A stress mibi with viability study on May , 1998. 3.
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty on July , 1998.
BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of
a 35 to 40 pack year smoking , and non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus for 14 years. The patient has been waking with occasional
shortness of breath over the preceding three weeks , and having
chest pressure lasting 30 seconds to a minute that resolves
spontaneously. The night prior to admission , the patient woke from
sleep with severe dyspnea , chest pressure , and diaphoresis. He
denied any nausea , pain , or radiation of his symptoms. The
paramedics were called and the patient was noted to have an oxygen
saturation of 70 to 80 percent on room air. He was intubated in
the field and taken to Tlwake University Hospital .  The initial
electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations in V1 to V3 , with T wave
inversions in V3 through V6. He was treated with tPA at Enle Hospital .  He was treated with intravenous Lasix for presumed
congestive heart failure and hypertension , and was admitted to the
Cardiac Care Unit. He was placed on nitroglycerin drip which was
titrated to his blood pressure. He was successfully extubated the
following morning. He was started on metoprolol , digoxin ,
lisinopril , and a heparin drip. He underwent an echocardiogram
which showed an ejection fraction of 25 percent with global
hypokinesis. He remained pain-free throughout his hospitalization ,
and had no further episodes of dyspnea. He was transferred to the
Wadl Uhump Medical Center on February , 1998 for further management of
his myocardial infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. History of renal carcinoma status post
nephrectomy in 1994. 2. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3. Mild hypercholesterolemia which is not currently being treated.
4. Renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy with a baseline
creatinine of 2.0.
MEDICATIONS: Glyburide. At Andsto Eredja Healthcare : 1. Heparin. 2.
Aspirin. 3. Insulin sliding scale. 4. Lisinopril. 5.
Furosemide. 6. Zocor. 7. Lopressor. 8. Digoxin. 9. Pepcid.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 35 to 40 pack year history of tobacco.
He rarely drinks alcohol , and denies any drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , overweight man in
no acute distress. Vital signs: The patient had a temperature of
98.4 , heart rate 77 , blood pressure 143/78 , respirations 18 , and
oxygen saturation of 91 percent on three liters by nasal cannula.
HEENT examination showed pupils that were equal , round , and
reactive to light and accommodation. Conjunctiva were anicteric.
Extraocular movements are intact , and his oropharynx was clear.
Neck examination was supple with his jugular venous pressure at
approximately 8.0 centimeters. There was no lymphadenopathy.
Chest examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally , with no
rales. Heart examination was regular rate and rhythm with a
non-displaced PMI and a positive S3. There was no murmur.
Abdominal examination showed an obese , soft abdomen with positive
bowel sounds. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. No
masses were palpated. The extremities were warm with no edema. He
had 1+ femoral pulses bilaterally. His left lower extremity had a
1+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. His right lower
extremity had a 1+ dorsalis pedis pulse with a nonpalpable
posterior tibial pulse. Neurological examination , he was alert and
oriented x three. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 are intact and
symmetric. He had 5/5 strength throughout. Deep tendon reflexes
were 2+ throughout with downgoing toes bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies from Ter Memorial Hospital showed a sodium
of 139 , potassium of 4.5 , chloride 109 , CO2 of 21 , BUN of 22 , and
creatinine of 2.2. Glucose was 236. Liver function tests were
within normal limits with an alkaline phosphatase of 95 , total
bilirubin of 0.4 , and AST of 39. CPKs were 151 , 163 , and 163 with
no MB fractions done. His TnI was less than 0.2 to 0.3. He had a
white count of 14.2 with a hematocrit of 42.9 and platelets of 222.
His triglycerides were elevated at 303 , and his cholesterol was
elevated at 265 with an HDL fraction of 32 and an LDL fraction of
172. His prothrombin time was 11.3 , partial thromboplastin time
28.4 , and INR 0.85. Urinalysis was negative. An electrocardiogram
was performed at the time of admission which showed resolution of
the ST elevations. He had T wave inversions in V2 through V4 , and
flat T waves in V5 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1. Myocardial Infarction: He was
continued on a heparin drip , Lopressor , and lisinopril. His
digoxin was discontinued at the time of admission. Nitroglycerin
was given only p.r.n. He remained symptom-free throughout his
hospitalization. His elevated cholesterol was treated. He
underwent cardiac catheterization on July , 1998 which showed 50
percent left main obstruction and 90 percent complex mid left
anterior descending. His right coronary artery was occluded. The
patient did well both during and after the catheterization. The
patient underwent a stress mibi test with a viability study on January , 1998 which showed ischemia during his exercise tolerance test.
The mibi showed severe ischemia in 11/25 segments , as well as an
infarct on the apical septum , apex , and base of the inferior wall.
Options were considered including coronary artery bypass grafting
and angioplasty. After a long discussion with the Cardiology
Service , Cardiac Surgery , the Renal Service and the patient , the
decision was made to proceed with angioplasty. On July , 1998 ,
the patient underwent a percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of his right coronary artery with zero percent residual
blockage. He also had two stents into his left anterior descending
with zero percent residual blockage. The patient tolerated the
procedure well.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma for
which he underwent a nephrectomy in 1994. He also has chronic
renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy. As surgery was being
considered for his cardiac disease , a Renal consultation was
obtained to evaluate his renal status. He underwent a renal
ultrasound showing an exophytic mass in his solitary kidney. This
was very concerning for recurrence of carcinoma. He then underwent
an MRI study which showed a nonenhancing mass in the kidney which
was most consistent with a hyperdense , proteinaceous cyst. This
was reassuring , though cancer could not be ruled out 100 percent.
The patient's renal function remained stable throughout his
hospitalization.
3. Non-insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was
placed on an insulin sliding scale during his hospitalization. He
was instructed to continue with his Glyburide , and to follow-up as
usual with his outpatient provider.
The patient was discharged to home on October , 1998 , one day
following his second catheterization procedure. The patient did
very well following the procedure , and had remained pain and
dyspnea-free.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: 1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d. 2. Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Lopressor 12.5 mg
p.o. three times per day. 4. Nitroglycerin 1/150 sublingual
tablets , one sublingually every five minutes x three as needed for
chest pain. 5. Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6. Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
q.h.s. 7. Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 8. Ticlid 250 mg p.o.
b.i.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient was instructed to follow-up with his
primary care physician , and to call the office to schedule an
appointment. The necessary follow-up with Cardiology and with the
nephrologist will be scheduled as an outpatient.

Discharge Date: 1/1/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
3. URINARY TRACT INFECTION.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70-year-old woman who
was followed in cardiology by
Dr. Pikula who has presumed diastolic dysfunction , who was in her
usual state of health until 1/23 , when she was admitted to the Dobubay Naicent University Of Medical Center with a flare of Crohn's ileitis.
At the time of her discharge , she was not restarted on her Lasix
and subsequently developed fluid retention with gradual worsening ,
shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. The patient noted a
20 lb weight gain during this period , as well as increasing
orthopnea and increasing dyspnea on exertion when getting dressed
or doing any different movements. She was seen in cardiology
clinic on 8/3/02 and found to be in much worse congestive heart
failure with new atrial fibrillation. She was transferred then to
the emergency department here at the Peresvillee Nawvine University Of Hospitals And Clinics .
Her most recent echocardiogram on 4/29/01 revealed mild to
moderate left ventricular hypertrophy without any regional wall
motion abnormalities. Her systolic ejection fraction was estimated
to be 60% suggesting a diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction and heart
failure. She was admitted with volume overload for diuresis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The review of symptoms was notable for chest
tightness with occasional palpitations. She
experienced no dizziness , no syncope and no recent diarrhea , no
abdominal pain , no nausea or vomiting. She did report chronic
arthritis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Significant for congestive heart failure
due to diastolic dysfunction , ( 2 ) Crohn's
colitis diagnosed in 1963 , ( 3 ) Right breast carcinoma stage II
previously treated , not currently active , ( 4 ) Diabetes mellitus ,
( 5 ) Obstructive sleep apnea , ( 6 ) Gastroesophageal reflux disease ,
( 7 ) Hypercholesterolemia , ( 8 ) Osteoarthritis.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a prior tobacco smoker , having
smoked two packs per day for 38 years , but has
quit. She does not drink alcohol and does not use any recreational
drugs. The patient lives in Di with a friend and is a retired
x-ray technician.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ALLERGIES: The patient's medical allergies include penicillin ,
which causes a rash , Demerol and Dilaudid causing
nausea , and Macrodantin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Included a temperature of 97 ,
heart rate 76 , blood pressure 90/60 ,
respiratory rate 28 , and a saturation of 97% on room air. The
patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation. GENERAL: Physical
examination showed that the patient was alert and oriented x3 , in
no acute distress , having shortness of breath while sitting up in
bed. HEENT: Normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , round , and
reactive , extraocular movements were intact. NECK: Showed jugular
venous distention to at least 20 cm. CHEST: Showed crackles
posteriorly approximately half of the way up. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Showed an irregular rhythm and a systolic ejection murmur
consistent with the prior diagnosis of aortic stenosis. ABDOMEN:
Showed profound obesity. EXTREMITIES: Showed significant pitting
edema bilaterally over the calves.
LABORATORY DATA: Showed a white blood cell count of 7 , hematocrit
31 , platelets of 148. Sodium was 142 , potassium
3.9 , BUN 56 , creatinine 1.3 , with a glucose of 75. Liver function
tests were normal. CK was 44 and troponin was 0.02. A chest x-ray
showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion without any evidence of
infiltrates. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 72 ,
otherwise no abnormalities beside some nonspecific ST-T wave
changes. Urinalysis showed evidence of an urinary tract infection
with 20-30 white blood cells and was leukocyte esterase positive.
Urine culture was sent at that time.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Congestive heart failure - The patient was
started on IV Lasix along with Zaroxolyn and
responded with a brisk diuresis over the course of the admission.
The patient's weight declined by approximately 5.2 kg. It was
estimated that the total volume of fluid removed was approximately
15 liters. The patient was reported great improvement in her
symptoms , was able to ambulate without requiring supplemental
oxygen. The patient was switched to oral Lasix and continued her
diuresis. The day prior to discharge , the patient was switched to
oral torsemide , and she will be discharged on that medication.
2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient was noted to have new onset
of atrial fibrillation while being seen in cardiology clinic on
8/3/02 . Since it was not known how long the atrial fibrillation
had been going on , a decision was made to anticoagulate the
patient. She was initially started on intravenous unfractionated
heparin while starting anticoagulation with Coumadin. The patient
reached a therapeutic INR of 2.5 within approximately 4-5 days and
the IV heparin was discontinued. At the time of discharge , the
patient INR was 3.2. She will have INR follow up through her
primary cardiologist , Dr. Janousek . Currently , the decision to
cardiovert the patient is left in the hands of her outpatient
cardiologist.
3. Urinary tract infection - The patient's initial urinalysis
indicated a bacterial urinary tract infection. Subsequent urine
culture grew out E. coli , which was subsequently determined to be
resistant to levofloxacin. Initially , the patient had been started
on IV levofloxacin , which was subsequently changed to p.o.
cefixime. The patient completed a five-day course of p.o. cefixime
while here in the hospital and was discharged on that medicine to
complete a 10-day course. Of note , the initial symptoms the
patient had including hematuria , resolved by the time of discharge.
4. Diabetes mellitus - The patient has a long history of diabetes
requiring insulin treatment. She is followed by endocrinologist at
the Kingnix Lowemar W.kell Medical Center .  During this hospitalization , her
blood sugars were maintained with insulin subcutaneous injections.
The patient is to continue the management of her diabetes per her
endocrinologist.

HPI:This is a 63 year-old female with history of CAD s/p MI and PCI
( stent to D1; see cardiac anatomy below ) , HTN , DM , hypercholesterolemia ,
obesity. She was last in her usual state of health approximately 1
month ago when she developed a ""head cold"" that has been marked by
frequent coughing and SOB/DOE. Her appetite has been quite poor , and she
reports occasional dizziness. She has been taking her diuretics
faithfully and has been making her usual UOP. She has not been using her
CPAP recently due to her head cold.
She awoke this morning feeling as if she were being choked. She reports
coughing quite violently and bringing up grayish/yellowish sputum
( no blood ). After her coughing spell , she became quite nauseated but
cannot remember if she threw up. She also developed some diffuse
chest tightness that lasted for approximately 10 minutes ,
associated with subjective fevers and diaphoresis. She returned to
sleep , but this time sitting up in her sofa. She reports that she has
been coughing throughout the day with 1 additional fleeting
episode of chest tightness this evening. She was CP-free upon
evaluation in the ED.
Of note , her presenting symptom during her NSTEMI back in '02 was low
back pain.

Review of Systems: As above. She further denies weight gain/loss , LE
edema , orthopnea , diarrhea , constipation , abdominal pain.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV: Started on IV Heparin and Lipitor dose increased to 80mg. Cont'd
b-blocker and full dose aspirin. Pt was free of CP upon admission and
throughout admission. EKG remained at baseline abnormal but showed no
overt ischemic changes. Her first set of enzymes revealed a slightly
elevated CK 371 w/MB fraction of 3.7 , but all three troponins were
negative. Although her story was not convincing for ACS , her TIMI score=4
( known CAD , more than 2 episodes in last 24 h , previous ASA use , 3
cardiac RF's of HTN , DM , CHOL ).
MIBI nondiagnostic b/c of obesity. Pt did not tolerate cardiac PET on
8/17 , b/c of anxiety/claustraphobia , then refused to have study w/IVCS.
Given the fact that pt ruled out for MI , and that pain did not recur ,
team suspects CP may be related to cough ( M/S and/or pleuritic in
etiology ) and no further inpt CAD workup was pursued. Pt to f/u w/her
cardiologist 11/3 .
2. RENAL: new ARF likely secondary to taking home lasix in setting of
poor PO's , Cr improved to 1.4 after holding Cozaar and diuretics and
giving IVF. Pt instructed to restart Lasix and Cozaar on 7/18 .  Pt will
be followed by KOOTE HEALTH .  Wt upon admit=not recorded , wt upon d/c=258lbs.
3. PULM: Stable O2 sat and exercise tolerance on day of d/c. Sputum cx
grew mixed flora. Cont'd Advair , Albuterol , restarted nocturnal CPAP.
Tessalon ordered PRN.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: ATTN PATIENT:
1. if you develop recurrence of chest pain , worsening cough , difficulty
breathing , fever >101 , or any other symptoms that are worrisome to you
call your PCP or return to the ER for re-eval.
2. Keep records of your weight and blood sugars and bring the record to
your follow up appointments.
3. Bring your medications to your f/u cardiology appt for review by your
doctor.
ATTN VNA:
1. please reconcile home meds as pt was unable to clarify her pre-admit
meds during this admit and pt is essentially being discharged home on the
medications that were in the AMH computer system. if there are any
discrepancies w/available home meds in comparison to d/c med list then
notify pt's PCP.
2. daily CV and Pulm assessment ( including daily weights )
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
ATTN CARDIOLOGY: During f/u eval can you please review daily wts
and check a creatinine. Decide if diuretics and/or Cozaar needs
adjustment.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 5/30/05 and taken
to the operating room where he underwent a heart transplant and
excision of HeartMate LVAD without complication. For further
details , please see the dictated operative note. The patient was
on bypass for 200 minutes with cross clamp time of 77 minutes.
He left the operating room with one atrial wire , one ventricular
wire , three pair of cardio tubes ( Blake drains ) , and two right
pleural tubes ( Blake drains ). AICD was excised from left
clavicular space and a Blake drain was left in the pacer pocket.
The patient was admitted to the Tiesdea Rellla Memorial Hospital ICU on discharge from
the operating room. The patient was extubated on the evening of
postop day 0 without complications. He was brought up on
epinephrine , milrinone , dopamine , vasopressin , insulin , and
propofol drips.
ICU COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Neuro: The patient was extubated early on postop day 1 and
propofol was turned off on arrival to the ICU. The patient was
given Dilaudid IV initially for pain , converted to p.o. Dilaudid.
He was also started on Zoloft on postop day 2 at 75 mg p.o.
daily for his anxiety. He is relatively anxious but his pain has
been well controlled with Dilaudid. He will leave the ICU on
Dilaudid p.o. p.r.n. pain.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was brought up from the
operating room on epinephrine , milrinone , dopamine , and
vasopressin drips. All drips were continued from postop day 1 to
postop day 2. The patient's cardiac output and index were stable
and his next venous saturations were stable in the 70s on this
combination. Epinephrine was weaned slowly from postop days 2-3.
It was off by postop day 4. Dopamine and vasopressin were also
weaned from postop day 4-5. Hemodynamics remained stable.
Milrinone was decreased to 0.4 from 0.5 on postop day 6. The
patient will leave the ICU on postop day 6 and milrinone per Dr.
Kridler will be weaned at 0.1 per day. The patient has been
hemodynamically stable from a cardiovascular standpoint since
arrival from the operating room. He was started on aspirin 81
daily. Swan was removed prior to discharge from the intensive
care unit on postop day 5 , 11/4/05 .
3. Pulmonary: The patient was extubated early on postop day 1
without complications. The patient remained very wet secondary
to the amount of fluid and products he received in the operating
room. The patient was started on a Lasix drip on postop day 1 ,
which was continued for a goal urine output of 200 to 300 cc an
hours. Patient with negative 3-4 liters in 24 hours over the
postop days 2-5. Lasix was discontinued on postop day 5 prior to
transfer from the ICU as patient had been diuresing a large
amount and creatinine had risen slightly up to 2.1 from 1.5
preoperatively. Urine output will continue to be monitored with
a goal of negative overall fluid balance , as patient remains wet
on chest x-ray.
4. GI: The patient's diet was advanced as tolerated. He is
currently eating a regular low-fat , low-cholesterol diet and is
on Nexium. He also remains on vitamins , folate , Colace , and
lactulose. He has still not had a bowel movement prior to
discharge from the intensive care unit.
5. Renal: The patient was aggressively diuresed beginning on
postop day 1 with a Lasix drip. The Lasix drip was adjusted for
a goal urine output of 200 to 300 cc an hour for several days.
Drip was turned off on postop day 4 for a short period and again
on postop day 5 as urine output remained stable at greater than
200 an hour. Lasix drip is off on postop day 5 prior to transfer
from the intensive care unit. The patient will continue to need
diuresis since he is still wet on chest x-ray. The patient's
creatine has bumped , however , from 1.5 to 2.1 at this point.
6. Endocrine: The patient was weaned from his insulin drip on
postop day 5. He was continued on the Portland protocol during
his time in the ICU as sugars were greater than 150. The patient
was started on postop day 2 on prednisone 35 p.o. b.i.d. , Neoral
75 mg p.o. b.i.d. , which was since increased to 100. At the time
of discharge , patient remained on prednisone 35 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Neoral 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and CellCept 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. per
the transplant team. Cyclosporin levels were followed and doses
were adjusted as needed.
7. Heme: The patient was started on aspirin beginning on postop
day 1. Aspirin is 81 mg p.o. daily.
8. ID: The patient received vancomycin for his chest tube
prophylaxis. Chest tubes removed on 7/18/05 , postop day 4.
Vanco was discontinued after this. Bactrim was also started on
postop day 1 for PCP prophylaxis and Valcyte was started several
days later as the donor heart was CMV positive.
Additional discharge medications and instructions will be
dictated by the PA on the floor when the patient is discharge
home.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: In short , Ms. Wesley Antonopoulos is a
55-year-old woman with a long history of nonischemic dialytic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 30% , resting tachycardia , diabetes
type 2 , tubal ligation , obesity status post stomach stapling at
VHMC with acute decompensation for three weeks , abdominal bloating
and fatigue , status post systemic stapling but that was years
prior and now , has had a decompensation of heart failure for
three weeks , abdominal bloating and fatigue. Of note , she is on
clinical trial with implanted PA catheter placed in 2001. She
was seen in the heart failure clinic with systolic blood
pressures of 90 , baselines 110s-120s and baseline heart rate of
100s. She was admitted for diuresis and possible transplant work
up. The patient was unaware of the transplant plans at that
time.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient on exam was afebrile , heart
rate in the 90s , blood pressure 110/80 , 100% on room air , JVP of
13 , clear chest , regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 , obese
abdomen , liver edge 4 cm below right costal margin , warm and well
perfused with 1+ edema , 2+ DP pulses.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Pumpwise , she is unclear trigger for compensation but low ACS
probably at that time. Had diuresed greater than 11 liters on
Lasix drip , Zaroxolyn and dobutamine at 2. Towards the end of
the hospitalization , even if slightly negative , she was changed
to torsemide p.o. Echo read no effusion and an EF of 15%
thrombus versus veg on device. Patient has implanted device
which measures p.o. pressures , again from the clinical trial. We
continued her ACE inhibitor , no beta-blocker given though poor
tolerance. She has continued on that. She had a right heart
cath on 2/12/04 showing very high SVR. Discharge was status
post steroid therapy , off nipride and dobutamine , transplant work
up was nearly complete. She was weaned off nipride with
captopril. Her goal event is slightly negative and patient
seemed to be doing very well.
B. Ischemia wise , she had no evidence for ACF and was not ruled
out for MI.
C. Rhythm-wise , normal sinus rhythm. On tele , she had some PVCs
and nonsustained VT. Caution for ectopy , given dobutamine drip
but no ectopy was seen.
2. ID-wise. PICC was placed on 3/6/04 and Cortef was dc'd.
3. Endocrine-wise. Patient's diabetes , she was on glipizide and
Regular insulin sliding scale. We started Lantus and this was
dc'd as an outpatient. The patient will follow up with her
primary care doctor to better control her diabetes.
4. FEN: The patient is on cardiac and diabetic diet with fluid
restriction and salt restriction and on a multivitamin.
5. Heme-wise: She was on heparin for thrombus with a PTT goal
of 60-80. She was started on a Coumadin bridge on 3/6/04 and
sent home with Lovenox shots. Her INR was thought to be followed
up by her primary care doctor and Rudolf Tretheway . She lives in
An , so they will both follow up.
6. Musculoskeletal: She is on probenecid for gout status post
Decadron and taper for a gout flare that worsened.
7. Psych-wise: She has depression and anxiety. She is on
Advair and Celexa.
8. Renal-wise: Her creatinine improved from 2 to 1.4 status
post dc of Cozaar and colchicine till 1.1 , I believe , on the day
of discharge.
FOLLOW-UP PLAN: The patient was following up again with Dr.
Wuerth and also with Marc Balck within two weeks of her
discharge , also following up with her Coumadin Clinic to allow a
close follow of her INR given anticoagulation for the device she
has in place.

18. HISTORY OF MEDICAL NONADHERENCE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old African-
American gentleman with a complicated
medical history including severe alcoholism and coronary artery
disease , congestive heart failure who has at baseline had shortness
of breath , dyspnea on exertion and at times paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea also orthopnea. He has a history of medical nonadherence ,
noncompliance. The patient presented four days prior to admission
on 10 of February to his primary care physician Dr. Dubrey with a cough
chills , but no fever , myalgias , pleuritic chest pain and weight
loss of 9 lb , from 167 to 158 in three months with increased
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The patient had not been taking his
congestive heart failure/cardiac medications for at least one week.
A chest x-ray at that time was negative for pneumonia but was
suggestive congestive heart failure. He was also diagnosed with a
probably URI. His congestive heart failure medications were
refilled. A PPD was placed at that time. The patient was not
getting antibiotics.
The patient developed progressive malaise , anorexia , was unable to
get out of bed , poor p.o. He denied any increased alcohol abuse at
that time. There was no abdominal pain per the patient's
girlfriend but there were complaints that the patient's mental
status was worsening. He was more lethargic and was found mumbling
by his girlfriend with increased shortness of breath and EMTs were
called who found the patient to be somewhat somnolent but arousable
with a blood glucose of 483 , blood pressure 110 /palp. He was
transferred to the Tabell Aleretsentla Medical Center emergency room.
The emergency room he was alert and oriented times two with
temperature of 89 rectally , blood pressure 120/68 , respiratory rate
28 , O2 of 100% on 100% face mask. An arterial blood gases pH was
7.13 , pO2 326 , pCO2 28. Acetest was positive. Betahydroxy
butyrate of 1.66. serum glucose was negative at 1800 with an anion
gap of 27 , serum sodium 129 , serum potassium 7.6 , BUN 178 and a
creatinine 7.5. The patient was treated with one liter of normal
saline IV over five hours , 20 units of IV insulin two amps of
bicarb , 30 grams of Kayexalate , one amp of calcium gluconate ,
Solu-Cortef 100 mg , ceftriaxone two grams IV. The patient's mental
status markedly improved after the hydration. The patient was then
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for treatment
evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Please see problem list above. Also of
note , the patient has a history of severe
alcoholism , denies any preadmission alcohol binges at that time;
but , later admitted to drinking of one to two gallons of gin and
vodka at a time with his friends and also drinking many beers. At
baseline , the patient has some shortness of breath , dyspnea on
exertion , orthopnea and at times paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. His
last echo previously the one done on this admission was in 11/27
which showed an ejection fraction of approximately 30% with
anteroseptal HK , posterior lateral HK , inferior AK , 1+ MR and AR
and an ETT MIBI in 5 of August showed IMI , ischemia. However , an echo
repeated during this admission showed an approximate ejection
fraction of 50% with inferior and septal HK only and mild aortic
insufficiency and mitral regurgitation .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs - Temperature 94.0 , pulse 78 ,
and regular , blood pressure 100/66 , O2 is
100% saturation on 100% facemask. Respiratory rate 28. In
general , the patient was responsive to voice and oriented to
En Hospital , and said 1997. Head , eyes , ears ,
nose and throat exam showed that he was anicteric. Extraocular
movements are intact. Pupils are equal , round , reactive to light , 2
mm. Oropharynx was dry. There was no jugular venous distention
and low lymphadenopathy. The neck was supple. Lungs - Had few
bibasilar crackles , greater on the right. Cardiovascular - Regular
rate and rhythm with positive ectopy , no murmur , regurg or gallop.
His abdomen was soft , diffusely tender , mildly distended with
positive bowel sounds with no liver edge palpated. He was heme
negative in the emergency room with no rebound. Extremities -
Trace edema bilaterally and were somewhat cool. His skin had no
petechiae , no rash and no splinters. Neurological - He was able to
move all extremities. His reflexes were 2 in the upper and lower
extremities except for the left ankle which was 1 and his right
ankle was 0. His left toe was downgoing. His right toe was
equivocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant for a WBC of 11 , hematocrit was
normal at 43 , platelets 160. Significant for
bandemia of 14 , 81 polys , INR 1.3 , SMA-7 was significant for a
serum sodium of 129 , potassium 7.6 , chloride of 91 , bicarb of 11 ,

troponion-I was 0. Lipase was 22 , 610 , amylase was 2840. Liver
function tests were within normal limits , ALT of 11 , AST of 10 , LDH
174 , alk phos of 11 , T-bili of 0.4 , albumin of 3.5 , calcium 9.3.
Phos was elevated at 12.8 , magnesium was elevated at 5.2. UA was

level was 0.8 , tox screen was negative. UA - had 0-1 wbcs , SG of
1.023.
EKG showed ventricular pacing at a rate of 77.
Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrates or effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for further treatment evaluation of his
severe metabolic abnormalities. He also by labs he had a
significant severe pancreatitis and was felt to be either a DKA or
HHNKA. An endocrine consult was obtained and they felt that the
patient was likely not in DKA as the patient's level of
betahydroxybutyrate of 1.66 was not enought to explain the
patient's gap or all his metabolic disturbances. The endocrine
service that more likely the patient had hyperglycemic ,
hyperosmolar , nonketotic acidosis and also severe pancreatitis.
Initial screens for the cause of pancreatitis were negative
including stones. The patient has significant alcohol history and
has been drinking alcohol which is the most likely cause of his
severe pancreatic insufficiency. The patient was aggressively
hydrated with IV fluids and his metabolic abnormalities began to
correct. He was also noted by labs to be in acute renal failure
and a renal consult was obtained. The patient's nonoliguric renal
failure was in the setting of severe dehydration secondary to
hyperosmolar state and ACE inhibitors were felt most likely due to
ATN. A renal ultrasound performed on 1 of July showed no evidence of
gallstones or biliary duct dilatation.
An abdominal CT performed on 7 of July showed grade I pancreatitis with
no evidence of a pseudocyst. The patient's clinical course was
complicated by rhabdomyolysis which was felt to be due to a
hypophosphatemic state , but this was not completely clear as the
patient's CKs began to rise while the patient's phosphate was still
secondary to the acute renal failure. The patient's CKs peaked
around 10 , 000 and then began to fall steadily and the patient's
renal function with continued hydration improved steadily as his
creatinine and BUN returned to normal. However , in the night of
20 of June the patient's abdominal pain worsened and there was a
question of peritoneal signs which prompted an emergent exploratory
laparotomy to rule out abdominal ischemia. However , the findings
were not consistent with ischemic bowel , but only severe
pancreatitis was noted. On 25 of July and 20 of June the patient did very well
postoperatively back in the Medical Intensive Care Unit. He was
started on TPN and with a slow wean of his of dextrose , his blood
sugars normalized. On 20 of June the patient's renal function had also
normalized. The patient by 5 of September had marked decreased abdominal
pain , normalized electrolytes and his renal function was at his
baseline with a creatinine of 1.0.
The patient was transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit
to our service on 8 of May on TPN and the following medications:
1. Digoxin 0.375 mg q.d.
2. Carafate one gram b.i.d.
3. Albuterol two puffs t.i.d.
4. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
He is also on TPN , but was being advanced to a clear liquid diet
and seemed to be tolerating it well. He also continued to require
a large amount of insulin through his TPN and also through his
sliding scale. The patient did well and was able to tolerate a
clear liquid diet and was advanced in the next two days to a soft ,
solid diet with very low fat.
I will dictate the rest of the patient's events , assessment and
plan by problem list as follows:
1. GI:
I. SEVERE PANCREATITIS: The patient was able to be advanced
to a soft solid diet for the past few days. She has abdominal pain
which had almost resolved and then resumed and the patient
developed a watery diarrhea. It was felt that this could be due to
pancreatic insufficiency versus C. diff colitis and therefore C.
diff samples were sent and the patient was presumptively started on
Flagyl and Pancrease 12 , 000 units t.i.d. 1/2 hour before meals.
The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea persisted. This prompted
us to make the patient n.p.o. once more and another abdominal CT
was obtained. An abdominal CT performed on 30 of March showed
progression of pancreatitis with increase inflammatory changes.
There was no necrosis or pseudocyst formation noted. Also noted
was some significant small bowel dilatation without any evidence of
obstruction. Therefore , the patient was continued to be kept
n.p.o. and TPN was restarted on 25 of April .  The patient has tolerated
this well and at this time has no longer had any abdominal pain
either subjectively or on exam. It does occasionally have mild low
back pain which is thought to actually be due to his pancreatitis
as opposed to any musculoskeletal cause.
II. DIARRHEA: The patient also had diarrhea as noted above.
He has been worked up extensively. His diarrhea has now resolved.
He was C. diff negative , but was treated presumptively with Flagyl
for seven days. All stool studies including Shigella , Salmonella ,
Campylobacter , ova and parasites , Microsporidia have been negative.
His stool has been sent for quantitative fecal fast which is still
pending on discharge. He has been repeatedly guaiac negative. As
noted above his diarrhea has resolved.
III. RESOLVED HEME POSITIVITY: The patient earlier in the
course of his Intensive Care Unit stay had some stools that were
heme positive. They were thought to be due to gastritis. He has
now been on initially , after that has been on Prilosec and now
changed over to ranitidine in his TPN and has had multiple guaiac
negative stools in the past ten days.
IV. SMALL PERIANAL ULCER: The patient was noted to have a
small perianal ulcer. It is felt to be secondary to pressure from
lying in bed and also secondary to his multiple episodes of
diarrhea which had been going on for days. It is felt that this
should resolve. If it does not , it is suggested that the ulcer be
swabbed and sent for HSV.
2. ENDOCRINE:
I. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS: Due to the patient's
pancreatic insufficiency , the patient will be a life long diabetic.
The patient has been followed by the endocrine service and is now
receiving 45 units of insulin per liter through his TPN. He is
also on a sliding scale regular regimen with finger stick q6h. It
is felt that this should be a relatively stable regimen for him at
this time. As the patient is weaned off his TPN and starts to take
p.o. again , he should be switched over to NPH b.i.d. with regular
insulin checks on a sliding scale before his meals. The patient
also has a follow-up appointment with the diabetes clinic in three
weeks as noted below.
3. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient does have a history of congestive
heart failure and has had mild bi-basilar crackles throughout his
stay here. This has not limited him in any way. He has had a good
oxygen saturations. The patient continues to take 40 mg of Lasix
p.o. q.d. On the day of discharge , he received an extra 20 mg IV
as he has been I&Os positive for the last few days and we noted a
slightly more crackles on his exam. Of note , the patient has a
long history of having paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but had been
doing relatively well here. His current medical regimen includes
Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. Both of
these can be titrated upwards as his blood pressure allows. He has
had some labile blood pressures ranging anywhere from the systolics
of 80s to 130s while in the hospital and he has never been
symptomatic and even when he has been , he has had blood pressures
in the 80s and has tolerated this well. He is also maintained on
digoxin 0.375 mg q.d. He is also taking aspirin for his cardiac
regimen.
4. PULMONARY: The patient had good O2 saturations and usually
ranging from 95 to 97% on room air and has had no pulmonary
problems. He has had bibasilar crackles on exam which is felt to
be due to some mild congestive heart failure for which he is taking
Lasix. He may need some extra doses of Lasix per your directions
the next few days.
5. HEME: The patient's hematocrit has been low in the high 20s on
two occasions. In both cases always drifting down slowly thought
to be due to delutional effects plus repeat a phlebotomy. He has
been transfused a total of three units while he has been in the
hospital here. Otherwise is hematocrit has been stable for
multiple days so has his platelets. Also of note the patient has
been heme negative from below for more than ten days.
6. RENAL: The patient says his baseline creatinine in which his
acute renal failure has resolved.
7. RHABDOMYOLYSIS: This has also resolved with the patient's CKs
having normalized over a week ago.
8. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient has remained afebrile , normal
white count for many days. While here he was also presumptively
treated for C. diff which was actually found to be negative on his
stool examinations with no fecal leukocytes. The patient's
temperature curve should be followed given that the patient
continues to have pancreatitis and is at risk for developing a
phlegmon.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. SEVERE PANCREATITIS: The patient continues to be on TPN. A
PICC line has been placed and a triple lumen catheter will be
removed prior to transfer of the patient. It is our feeling that
the patient should remain on TPN for the next two days and then as
per your directions , the patient could be slowly advanced on a p.o.
diet as tolerated. We feel that the patient deserves another trial
to see if he can tolerate p.o. before any long term decisions is
made regarding his nutrition and perhaps placement of a J-tube for
long term feeding. The patient's amylase and lipase on the day of
discharge are 47 for amylase and 166 for lipase. These values
continue to remain low even when the patient was having abdominal
pain. This is felt to be due to a relatively burnt out pancreas.
A GI consult was also obtained which agrees with this assessment.
It is felt that when the patient does start taking p.o. again he
should have pancreas at least 8 to 12 , 000 units t.i.d. half hour
before meals due to his pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Also
the patient should be followed clinically very closely including
his white count , fever curve and his abdominal exam for any signs
and symptoms of development of an infection or phlegmon or
pseudocyst because of his pancreatitis. The patient's TPN should
be continued as noted below.
2. ENDOCRINE INSUFFICIENCY: The patient , as noted above , will
require insulin , both through is TPN and his fingersticks should be
checked every six hours. As noted when the patient is switched
over to a p.o. regimen , we suggest per endocrine recommendations
that NPH be given b.i.d. and the patient should be covered with an
insulin sliding scale at bedtime.
The patient is being transferred to Redist Nalereamer Memorial Hospital on
2 of April in good condition. The patient today denies any abdominal
pain , nausea or vomiting , but occasionally continues to have mild
back pain. His diarrhea has resolved. He is afebrile with a blood
pressure of 120/70 , pulse is 69 , respiratory rate 16 , sat 97 on
room air , with a weight of 69.0 kg. He is comfortable and has had
bibasilar crackles of 1/4 the way up. His abdomen is soft ,
nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds. His
extremities are without edema.
On the day of discharge his white count is 8.8 , hematocrit is 36 ,
ADDplatelets of 348. His SMA-7 was within normal limits with a
creatinine of 0.6. His amylase is 47 and his lipase is 160.
DISPOSITION: The patient is being discharged in good condition
to Lakesfic Hospital Medical Center .  His primary care
physician Dr. Littmann is aware of the patient's discharge and will
continue to follow with his care. The patient also has an
appointment with Dr. Sanislo in the Diabetes Clinic at Longa Ent No on 7 of January at 11 a.m.

CARDIAC SURGERY CONSULT: CURT O. MAULDING , M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: 1. CARDIOMYOPATHY OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY.
2. RETROSTERNAL CHEST PAIN FOR RULE OUT
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
3. NONINSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
4. HISTORY OF PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Mrs. Troy Burrus is a 54-year-old woman from Ston Chandseu Sa with a background history of idiopathic
cardiomyopathy and noninsulin-dependent diabetes , and pulmonary
tuberculosis who presented with an 20 minute episode of chest pain
and dyspnea for a rule out myocardial infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is remarkable for 1 ) A
cardiomyopathy of 10 years' duration of
unknown etiology. The patient denies alcohol abuse. There is no
history of rheumatic fevers in childhood. There is no valvular
defects , and has no known risk factors for coronary artery disease ,
aside from her noninsulin-dependent diabetes. The etiology at this
point is thought to be viral. The patient experiences intermittent
episodes of mild chest pain and chest pressure with exertion
approximately one episode every 2-3 months and is not currently on
sublingual nitrates. She has no known coronary artery disease and
has not had a myocardial infarction. 2 ) Noninsulin-dependent
diabetes times three years , well controlled on Glucotrol 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and diabetic diet. She has no known diabetic retinopathy ,
nephropathy or peripheral neuropathy. 3 ) The patient has a history
of tuberculosis approximately 20 years ago , diagnosed from a lymph
node biopsy of the left neck. She was treated for one year with a
combination of medications. She currently experiences no night
sweats , loss or weight , loss of appetite or hemoptysis. She does ,
however , admit to a dry cough especially at night which has been
increasing over the last six months. Her BCG status is unknown.
Past surgical history is remarkable for: 1 ) Status post cesarean
section times one. 2 ) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy ,
right salpingo-oophorectomy for metromenorrhagia approximately
1991. The patient currently denies any post or perimenopausal
symptoms. 3 ) Status post lymph node biopsy of the left neck
approximately 20 years ago for tuberculosis. The patient has no
known drug allergies. Family history is remarkable for diabetes
mellitus ( father ). The patient is a nonsmoker , denies alcohol abuse
or intravenous drug abuse. Medications on admission include
Digoxin 0.1 mg p.o. q a.m. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Glucotrol 10
mg p.o. b.i.d. , K-Dur 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d. and Capoten 37.5
mg p.o. q.i.d.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has noted increasing
dyspnea and worsening exercise
tolerance over the past six months. She was admitted to Namen's General Hospital under the care of Dr. Devera in April of 1992 for
congestive heart failure which resolved with diuresis. Since then
her baseline exercise tolerance is that she is unable to do a full
load of laundry without getting tired , unable to climb a full
flight of steps without getting tired , but does not experience
chest pain. However , today while walking in her sister-in-law's
house she experienced severe retrosternal chest pain radiating to
her left shoulder and back , which is as great as 10 out of 10 for
severity and lasted for approximately one minute. It was associated
with dyspnea , sweating and nausea but no vomiting. She also
experienced some palpitations. Therefore , she had persistent chest
pressure and dyspnea on arrival at the Amar Portraim Hospital
Emergency Room approximately 20 minutes later , at which time the
pressure and dyspnea were relieved with two sublingual nitrates.
Review of systems is remarkable also for chronic cough increasing
over the last five months , especially since her Capoten dose was
increased. She denies fever , chills , previous episodes of
pneumonia. Of note she was ruled out for active pulmonary
tuberculosis during her admission in Soba Medical Center in September 1992.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination on admission , she is a
pleasant , elderly woman. Her vital signs
reveal a temperature of 97.4 orally , heart rate of 80 regular ,
respiratory rate of 20 and blood pressure of 108/80 supine with no
orthostatic hypertension. O2 saturation was 99% on 4 liters. Head
and neck examination were unremarkable with no evidence of
adenopathy and a normal thyroid gland. Respiratory system showed
scattered bibasilar crackles but no focal pathology. Cardiovascular
system showed a heart rate of 80 which was regular at full volume
with occasional ectopic beats. There was no evidence of paradoxical
alternates. Jugular venous pressure was elevated to 10 cm above
the angle of Louis' and had a prominent CV wave. All pulses were
present and equal. The cardiac apex was in the sixth left
intercostal space. Midaxillary line was volume overloaded in
character. No thrills or rubs were appreciated , however , there was
dullness to percussion beyond the apex and an S3 gallop was heard
throughout the precordium. The patient had a soft S1 , a III/VI
pansystolic murmur heard best at the apex and radiating through to
the left axilla. There was also I/VI MVM which could be brought on
with exercise and lying in the left lateral position. A PI murmur
was also heart similar in character to the MI murmur but heard best
on the left sternal border and radiating up the neck. There was
also an ejection systolic murmur at the left sternal border II/VI
in intensity and radiating poorly increased with expiration.
Abdominal examination was soft , nontender , nondistended. There was
a 12 cm hepar which was soft and nonpulsatile. No spring was
palpable. No masses were appreciated. Bowel sounds were present ,
and there was no costovertebral angle tenderness. A well healed
subumbilical midline scar was evident. Rectal examination showed
no masses , guaiac negative brown stool. Bimanual examination was
deferred at this time. Central nervous system examination was
grossly intact. Extremities showed pulses to be present
bilaterally and equal. There was no evidence of deep venous
thrombosis and no pedal edema or sacral edema were appreciated.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory examinations on admission showed a
sodium of 136 , potassium 3.4 , blood urea nitrogen
16 , creatinine 0.8 , and a glucose of 136. White count was 8.2 with
a normal differential. Hematocrit was 41.2 and platelets 247. PT
and PTT were 13.4 and 29.4 respectively. Digoxin level was 2.1.
Chest X ray showed significant cardiomegaly with dilatation of both
left and right ventricles but minimal congestive heart failure. The
electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 86 beats per minute
with a complete left bundle branch block and no evidence of acute
ischemia. There was no change as compared with electrocardiograms
from 2/10 .  The initial CPK was 44.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary then the patient is a 54-year-old woman
with cardiomyopathy , noninsulin-dependent
diabetes , who presented now with an episode of chest pain and
dyspnea for rule out myocardial infarction and further evaluation.
Actively she is in hospital where it as follows: 1 ) Cardiomegaly of
unclear etiology: last echo done was in 25 of November by Dr. Pernin which
showed an ejection fraction of 25-30% with global left and right
ventricular dilatation. 2 ) Chest pressure and substernal chest pain
and dyspnea: The patient was placed on the telemetry floor , was
monitored for 24 hours and a rule out protocol was performed. The
CK were 44 , 37 , and 34 respectively and there was no evidence of
electrocardiogram changes on serial electrocardiogram. She did have
one run of 4-beat ventricular tachycardia the first 24 hours of
admission. Potassium was replaced in view of the potassium level of
3.4. Initial Digoxin level was 2.1 and Digoxin was held for a
period of 72 hours. She was continued on her Lasix , Captopril and
a sliding scale Nitropaste and was started on one aspirin a day.
3 ) Noninsulin-dependent diabetes was well controlled on diet and
Glucotrol and her sugars remained between 100 and 200 throughout
this admission. 4 ) Status post tuberculosis: In view of her
previous tuberculosis status , a PPD was not performed and the
patient was not ruled out for tuberculosis.
On review of Mrs. Ekis 's history and following a rule out for a
recent myocardial infarct , it became apparent that her exercise
tolerance had diminished dramatically over the past three months
and that she was already on optimal medications. It was thought
that she would benefit from a cardiac transplant evaluation at this
point and Dr. Gerathy was kind enough to consult. A transthoracic
echocardiogram performed on 2 of May showed once again a dilated
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. There was 2+ of
mitral regurgitation with a pulmonary arterial pressure of
approximately 60. There was also 3+ or PR and evidence of
significant left atrial hypertrophy. No ventricular clicks or
thrombosis were seen. However , in view of the dilated
cardiomyopathy , the patient was started on Coumadin therapy. An ETT
O2 uptake test was performed on 2 of May and the patient performed
for 3.38 minutes on a cycle ergometer. She experienced on chest
pain and there were no obvious electrocardiogram changes. The test
was stopped because of shortness of breath. Her O2 uptake was
calculated at 11.4 per kick per minute. In addition her Capoten
therapy was changed from 37.5 q.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. At this point
it became apparent that Mrs. Stuesse had a significant degree of
cardiac dysfunction. A right-sided catheterization performed on
5 of August showed a right atrial pressure of 26 and a pulmonary wedge
pressure of 36. It was decided that she would be an excellent
candidate for cardiac transplantation , and a full cardiac
transplant workup was initiated. The following tests were sent off ,
the results of many of which are still pending: 1 ) One chest X ray
detailed above; 2 ) electrocardiogram as detailed; 3 ) urinalysis and
sediment which are unremarkable; 4 ) SMA-7 with CPK , complete with
differential , PT , PTT , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , reticulocyte
count and bleeding time; 5 ) HLA typing and antibody screen which
are pending; 6 ) blood typing; 7 ) dental consult; 8 ) physiotherapy
consult; 9 ) Social Service consult; 10 ) nutrition consult; 11 )
Gynecology appointment made as an outpatient and a booking for
bilateral mammography was made; 12 ) pulmonary function tests were
performed; 13 ) noninvasive carotid Doppler studies and peripheral
arterial noninvasive studies were performed the results of which
are pending; 14 ) echocardiogram as detailed above; 15 ) exercise
test with O2 as detailed above; 16 ) 24-hour urine for creatinine
and protein; 17 ) HIV antibody test; 18 ) fasting glucose serum
protein , electrophoresis , cholesterol , triglycerides ,
immunoglobulins , hepatitis B and C serology , as well as blood
cultures , sputum cultures and urine cultures were sent; 19 )
psychiatric consults , has not been obtained at this point and will
be done as an outpatient; 20 ) virology titers for cytomegalovirus ,
Ebstein-Barr virus , toxoid , measles and varicella zoster were sent;
21 ) TFT and hemoglobin A1C were sent; and 22 ) right heart
catheterization as detailed above; 23 ) abdominal ultrasound to rule
out gallstones , aortic aneurysm and renal abnormalities were done
and were within normal limits.
DISPOSITION: At this point the patient will be discharged home in a
stable but guarded condition. She will be followed by
the Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery Departments at the Chapstone Hospital .  Her primary attending Dr. Mondelli from Sontriad University Hospitals
( telephone number 990 062-8307 ) will be updated as to her program.
Outstanding consults were be sorted on an outpatient basis and she
will be listed for a cardiac transplant. Her discharge medications
include Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d , K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5
mg p.o. t.i.d. She will also be sent home on home O2 as required.
Digoxin will be started at 0.1 mg p.o. q d. PT and PTT levels will
be checked q weekly and the patient's doses changed accordingly.

Discharge Date: 11/17/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE.
PROCEDURES: 1. Third and fifth toe amputation with wound
debridement.
2. Lower extremity angiogram.
3. Right transmetatarsal amputation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45 year old
gentleman with a history of severe
peripheral vascular disease who is status post aorto-bifemoral and
bilateral femoral-popliteal bypass grafting , who originally
presented in August of this year with an ischemic right foot and
gangrenous right great toe and fourth toe. Arteriogram revealed a
popliteal stenosis below his bypass with very poor runoff. The
popliteal artery was angioplastied with good results and
restoration of palpable anterior tibial pulses at the mid calf.
The patient only had moderate perfusion of the right foot , however ,
and presented in August of this year for wound debridement and
fourth toe amputation. The patient re-presents with a poorly
healing fourth toe amputation site and wound cellulitis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has poorly controlled insulin dependent
diabetes. He is status post myocardial
infarction in 1993 , 1996 and 1997. He has severe peripheral
vascular disease. He is status post bilateral femoral-popliteal
and bypass graft. He is status post aorto-bifemoral. He has a
history of coronary artery disease. He is status post coronary
artery bypass graft x three vessel. He has a history of congestive
heart failure , history of osteoarthritis.
MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.day , Lasix 120 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Zestril 50 mg p.o. q.day , aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.day , insulin NPH 10 units q.a.m. , q.p.m. and insulin Regular
sliding scale.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient is afebrile. Temperature was 98.2 ,
blood pressure 100/80 , pulse 85 ,
respirations 16. He had saturation of 98% on room air. In
general , he is a white male in no acute distress. HEENT was
normocephalic , atraumatic. Pupils were equally reactive to light
and accommodation. Extraocular muscles were intact. Sclerae were
anicteric. There was no lymphadenopathy. Lungs were clear to
auscultation. Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen
was soft , nontender , nondistended , with normal active bowel sounds.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal. Extremities were without clubbing ,
cyanosis or edema. On vascular exam , patient had 3+ bilateral
femoral pulses , 2+ bilateral popliteal pulses. He had biphasic
dopplerable bilateral posterior tibial pulses and a monophasic
dopplerable right dorsalis pedis pulse and no dopplerable left
dorsalis pedis pulse. His right great toe had a black eschar on
the tip. His fourth toe amputation site was with purulent
drainage. His third toe was erythematous and tender to palpation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the vascular service
for wound debridement and IV antibiotics. He was
initially evaluated by the cardiology service and endocrine
service. Patient was cleared by cardiology for the procedure and
was considered well managed medically in regard to his coronary
artery disease. In regard to patient's diabetes , he was initially
extremely brittle and requiring extensive fine tuning by the
endocrine service who , at the time of discharge , had his blood
sugars repeatedly under 200 , with easily achieved insulin regimen.
The patient was taken to the operating room initially on the 13 of June of
April where he underwent a right third and fifth toe amputation
with wound debridement. At the time of operation , purulent
drainage with necrotic regions of the bases of the third and fifth
toes were found. The wound was left open with packing , with
further plans for more formal TMA after adequate drainage of the
foot. The patient , from the beginning of the hospital course , was
started on IV vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl which he
continued throughout his hospital course. The patient tolerated
this initial wound debridement and toe amputation without incident.
Please see dictated operative report for further details. The
patient underwent an arteriogram on the 30 of August of April which
revealed one vessel runoff via peroneal artery to an irregular
appearing posterior tibial artery. The tibial peroneal trunk and
the proximal peroneal artery were found to have high grade
stenoses. There were numerous collateral vessels to a dorsalis
pedis artery at the level of the ankle. Based on this arteriogram
result and his wound , patient was preop'd for a transmetatarsal
amputation on the 2 of June of April . It was recommended by the
vascular staff that transmetatarsal amputation was the only option
for proximal limb salvage. He was not found to have any
appropriate anatomy for further reconstruction from an arterial
standpoint. The patient was taken to the operating room on the
2 of June of April where he underwent a formal right transmetatarsal
amputation. The patient's wound was debrided back to the viable
tissue and was closed in a primary fashion. Please see dictated
operative report for further details. Patient tolerated the
procedure well without complications and was transported back to
the PACU and the floor in stable condition. Postoperatively , the
patient has required wound packing to a small portion of the wound
which was left open for drainage. Initially , the wound was
erythematous with minimal to moderate drainage. At the time of
discharge , the wound has become far less erythematous , far less
painful and without any drainage. It is thought at this time that
patient now had three weeks of IV antibiotics and is stable enough
to go home on a p.o. regimen. Patient will be discharged on p.o.
levofloxacin and clindamycin with b.i.d. wound packing by VNA
service. Patient is discharged to home in stable condition with
followup to be early this week with Dr. Deandrade . Patient is also
recommended to call his cardiologist for appointment in 1-2 weeks
and his primary care physician in 1-2 weeks as well.

Discharge Date: 10/2/1996
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year old gravida
5 , para 5 , with history of
postmenopausal bleeding and thickened endometrial stripe by
ultrasound. She had a history of breast cancer status post
lumpectomy , radiotherapy , and Tamoxifen therapy with the Tamoxifen
therapy ongoing over the past four years. She was evaluated and
Pipelle biopsy was unsuccessful and fractional dilation and
curettage revealed scant inactive endometrial tissue. This was in
January of 1994. She had a follow-up endometrial biopsy which showed
quantity not sufficient and there was no further follow-up. All of
this was done outside of our offices. She saw Dr. Lamoreux for
evaluation initially of an irregular cervix on her initial intake
into the Ard Onhill Hospital Medical Center system and this history
was reviewed. She had always had normal Pap smears. Colposcopic
biopsy and endocervical curettage were all negative. She had not
at that point had postmenopausal bleeding for a couple of years.
Her uterus was felt to be overly enlarged and ultrasound showed a
1.9 cm irregular stripe. Pipelle was not possible , due perhaps to
stenosis of the internal os. Therefore she was brought for
fractional dilation and curettage and diagnostic hysteroscopy as an
inpatient because of her history of Coumadin therapy for chronic
atrial fibrillation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for rheumatic heart disease with
mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation , as
well as aortic insufficiency and mild tricuspid insufficiency. She
has had a history of chronic congestive heart failure. Chronic
atrial fibrillation is noted. Breast cancer is noted. There is a
question of a pulmonary edema in 1993.
MEDICATIONS: Tamoxin , Coumadin , Furosemide , Inderal , Lanoxin , Kay
Ciel.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , erythromycin , and Isordil.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke and does not drink.
PAST OB/GYN HISTORY: Spontaneous vaginal deliveries times five.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Beyond the breast surgery , this included
appendectomy in 1994 , as well as fractional
dilation and curettage in 1994.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Basically unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was preadmitted for switch-over to
heparin therapy. The heparin was then stopped
four hours prior to her surgical procedure which occurred on
4/11/96 . The findings at hysteroscopy and dilation and curettage
included normal appearing endocervical canal , 7.5 cm cavity , and an
approximately 3 x 1 cm endometrial polyp. She had lush
endometrium. The ostia were not easily visualized. The procedure
was very smooth and done under MAC anesthesia with paracervical
block and she had a minimal blood loss. Postoperatively she did
quite well without fever or other problems. She was put back on
her Coumadin such that , on the day of discharge , her INR was
approaching 2.0. She was discharged with plans for follow-up as an
outpatient regarding her Coumadin therapy.

Hospital course:
Generalized pain: She has a history of both rheumatoid arthritis
and fibromyalgia and some symptoms that have been concerning for
Polymyalgia rheumatica. For her acute pain exacerbation , a pain consult
was obtained and recommended using vicodin rather than dilaudid and
neurontin rather that topamax. These changes were made with good effect. A
rheumatology consult was also obtained and
suggested starting prednisone 10mg qd for possible PMR with close
follow up with her rheumatologist Dr. Dambrosi . They also suggested starting
calcium + vitaminD. Her pain improved on the
prednisone and she was seen by physical therapy who suggested
rehab placement for deconditioning and inability to care for herself.
**Renal: During the hospitalization , she developed new acute renal
failure due to decreased PO intake of fluids and continuation of her home
dose of lasix of 160qd which she then stated she had not been taking.
This was due to a pre-renal state and resolved completely with IV fluids.
**Depression: She was continued on her home regimen of elavil , seroquel ,
zoloft , and buspar.
**Diabetes Mellitus: She was continued on her home insulin regimen with
excellent control.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: PLease return if you develop fevers , chills , worsening shortness of
breath.

Lopressor 5mg , Morphine 2mg , Nitro SL , Hydral 10mg , Dilaudid. BP
decreased to 120/78. EKG showed new T wave inversions in AVF and V6 with
pseudonormalization of T wave in AVL. CT chest negative for dissection.
Serial troponins were <0.10 , 0.13 , <0.10 , bump likely result of demand
ischemia. As pt's CP was reproducible on palpation , not likely to be of
cardiac source , somewhat improved with narcotics. Pt maintained on home
regimen , with BP control from 120-160/60-90 in house. Echo showed severe
LVH , EF 50-55% , diastolic dysfunction , basal inferior akinetic , basal
superior dyskinetic , mid-posterior hypokinetic , unchanged from prev. Pt
will follow up with outpatient cardiologist Dr. Dodimead .
*Neuro: Pt described HA and episodes of vision loss in R eye lasting 5-10
minutes , concerning for amaurosis fugax vs atypical migraine vs temporal
arteritis ( had been biopsied for temporal arteritis in 10/5 because of
HA and elevated ESR - neg ). Neuro and Ophtho consulted. Pt described
vision loss as bilateral to consults - less concerning for embolic event.
MRA demonstrated no carotid stenosis or occlusion. ESR was only mildly
elevated at 32. Pt is already on aspirin , Plavix , statin and BP meds for
stroke prevention as per Neuro recs , though they recommended follow up
with outpatient Rheum to w/u temporal arteritis if sx continue. Ophtho
exam demonstrated typical dermoid in L eye ( unrelated to sx ) , retinal exam
showed evidence of PVD but no emboli , consult thought presentation not
consistent with giant cell arteritis , most likely atypical migraine.
*Pulm: Pt maintained on home regimen of Advair for asthma and CPAP at
night for OSA , no exacerbations in the hospital.
*Renal: Cr increased from 1.2 on admission ( baseline 1.0-1.8 , most likely
2/2 to chronic HTN ) to 1.7 on HD #2. Urine lytes demonstrated Na 100 Cl
78 Cr 152.3 ( FeNa 0.56% ) , UA showed 2+ LE. 10-15 WBC , 2+ bast6 , 1+ sq ,
but not treated because pt asymptomatic.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: -continue home medication regimen , but increase labetalol to 200
mg twice a day , norvasc to 5 mg twice a day , oxycontin dose to 50 mg
three times a day ( 40 mg home dose + 10 mg prescribed in hospital )
-make appointment to follow up with primary care physician Dr. Edward R Freeland
-follow up with cardiologist Dr. Krull on 5/10 at 2:40 pm ( his office
will call you if an appointment can be made earlier )
-fluid restricted ( 2 L ) and salt restricted ( 2 mg ) diet
-return to hospital if symptoms worsen
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
-continue home regimen , but increased labetalol to 200 mg BID , norvasc to
5 mg BID , oxycontin dose from 40 mg to 50 mg TID
-f/u with cardiologist Dr. Kinzer
-f/u with PCP Dr. Abram Blazina
-consider modification of HTN regimen if pressures not well controlled

admitted for NSTEMI ( MIBI with mod LCX disease and severe HK ) ,
patient declined cath. Patient currently being tx for osteo with po
linezolid/levo to complete 3wk course ( declined PICC and arterial
bipass ). Pt in USOH until 24hrs prior to admission when
she noted SOB , orthopnea , and increased edema. +URI sx and fever
100.2. No BRBPR , hematuria , or melena.

edema , no clear infiltrate but tech poor study
****HOSPITAL COURSE/PLAN*****
70yo now with new anemia and CHF. 1 ) CV-I: continue ROMI , positive
troponin likely anemia related demand; BB , statin ,
ASA 2 ) CV-P: appears vol overloaded , maybe be 2/2 to
med/diet non-compliance. Goal diuresis 1-2L/d met. Follow closely
during
transfusions. Echo 8/28 showed EF 55% , no
RWMA. We discharged this patient on 80 mg PO lasix with standing
potassium , she will be followed closely by VNA. 3 ) CV-R: no issues , on
tele for
RO 4 ) Heme: unclear etiology of anemia , most likely
2/2 to linezolid , other possibilities ACD , CKD , slow GI loss ( guiaic
neg ). Checking iron , retic , smear , hemolysis labs. Transfuse to goal
HCT 30. She received 2 units PRBC on night of admission and then hct
was stable. She had iron and vitamin B12 deficiency and was started on
supplements. 5 ) Renal: creatinine at BL at
1.6. 6 ) ID: R calcaneal osteo with MRSA ( bx
confirmed ) , planned treatment until 8/22 based on last discharge summary.
Change to vanco for concern of
marrow suppresion of linezolid. ID curbside is to use linezolid ,
and treat anemia w/ PRBC. needs 6 week course from 2/12/05 . Check BCx ,
foot films show no osteomyelitis , sputum cx shows klebsiella , likely
colonizer. Patient repeatedly refused PICC. She also believes
abdominal discomfort largely due to linezolid. Plastics evaluated the
heel and felt was healing nicely. To finish up 6 week course from

patient refused PICC for vanco. 7 ) GI: gastroparesis , giving reglan and
sucralfate. Aggressive bowel regimen. Patient finally responded to
miralax and lactulose , producing large BMs ( KUB showed much stool ) and
relief of abdominal distention and discomfort. 8 ) Pulm: SOB likely 2/2
to
pulm edema and anemia. 9 ) FEN: hyponatremia , pt has h/o hyponatremia.

q.d.; K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q.d.; albuterol and Atrovent; Pulmicort 4
puffs b.i.d.; MVI 1 tab p.o. q.d.; allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.d.;
Neurontin t.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Theophylline , which gives her anaphylaxis , and to both
sulfa and dye , which are of unclear significance.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. She quit smoking one week prior
to admission. She smoked one pack per day for 50
years. She rarely uses alcohol. She has three grown children.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother with a history of MI at age 75. Father
with a history of lung cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Elderly female in no apparent
distress. VITAL SIGNS: Temp 99 , pulse 100 ,
BP 130/60 , respiratory rate 20 , satting 96% on two liters. HEENT:
PERRL , EOMI , oropharynx benign , no erythema or exudate. No sinus
tenderness. NECK: Supple , no JVD , no bruits , no lymphadenopathy.
CHEST: Revealed rales at the right base , otherwise no wheezes at
the left. HEART: Regular rhythm and rate , normal S1 , S2 , II/VI
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
positive bowel sounds , soft , diffusely tender , no
hepatosplenomegaly , no masses. EXTREMITIES: Bilateral non-pitting
edema , left greater than right , with mild lower extremity erythema ,
also left greater than right. NEURO: Alert and oriented x3 ,
cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Her left
index and middle finger PIP joints were warm and tender.
LABORATORY DATA: White count 13.4 , hematocrit 33 , platelets 211.
Na 136 , K 4.3 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.1. CK 47 ,
troponin 0.14. EKG showed normal sinus tach at 125 beats/minute.
She had a new incomplete right bundle branch block , left atrial
enlargement , no acute ST or T-wave changes. Chest x-ray revealed
question of a right lower lobe infiltrate. This was also
consistent with a mild pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Sartoris , in the Emergency Department , was
treated with IV cefuroxime. She was subsequently
brought to the floor , and the Medical Team's assessment decided to
treat her empirically for a right lower lobe pneumonia with
levofloxacin. It was not all that clear that Ms. Bartlett had a
pneumonia , but she was treated for this anyway. She also had a
urine Legionella antigen , which was checked , as well as sputum
cultures which were unremarkable.
From a cardiovascular perspective , Ms. Cheesman ruled out for a
myocardial infarction , but received some Lasix for mild CHF.
During her hospital course , it was noted that her hematocrit
dropped from 33.3 to 28.4. This was mildly concerning given her
history of an infrarenal AAA. It was decided that she should have
an abdominal CT. This was done , and the abdominal aortic aneurysm
has not changed in size or did not reveal any evidence of leaking.
Ms. Villenas quickly improved after being treated with nebulizers.
She was then switched from nebulizers to inhalers and it was
decided that she was well enough to go home. Of note , her right
finger joints were mildly swollen and possibly consistent with a
gouty flare. She was treated initially with Indocin , but then
there was the concern that she could potentially have a GI bleed.
Thus , she was quickly taken off of the Indocin.
Ms. Peteet was discharged in stable condition to follow-up with her
primary care physician. Her discharge medications were as follows:
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 2 ) albuterol
inhalers; ( 3 ) allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.d.;
( 4 ) Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; ( 5 ) Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 6 )
glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 7 ) nitroglycerin SL p.r.n. chest pain;
( 8 ) Afrin 2 sprays intranasally b.i.d.; ( 9 ) MVI 1 tab p.o. q.d.;
( 10 ) simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.; ( 11 ) Atrovent inhaler q.i.d.;
( 12 ) Neurontin 200 mg p.o. t.i.d.; ( 13 ) levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
q.d. x10 days; ( 14 ) Pulmicort 4 puffs inhaled q.i.d.;
( 15 ) Combivent 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: The patient was to follow-up with Dr. Poitevint .
It was decided that she would require VNA
nursing to provide chest PT 3-4x over the course of the following
week. She is to have a follow-up chest x-ray in several weeks to
reassess the right lower lobe.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Aswegan is a 74-year-old woman ,
recently admitted to the Kimonte on 1/14/05 for CHF
exacerbation and UTI ( Gram-negative rods , Klebsiella ) who
presents to the Vide Tutenoke Rahbrier Healthcare with one day of abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting , and decreased ostomy output. The patient has a history
of multiple abdominal surgeries including a total colectomy for
ulcerative colitis with colostomy , ventral hernia repairs in
1998 , 2003 , and 2004 , revision of her colostomy in 1996 , 1997 ,
and 2003. As a result , she has had a chronic left lower quadrant
hernia. The patient denies any recent fevers , chills , melena , or
hematochezia from the ostomy. She has stable dyspnea on exertion
after 12 feet , she uses a walker at home. She denies PND. She
has two-pillow orthopnea. She has had stable lower extremity
edema in the past day and no dysuria. She also has a history of
a dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15 to 20% , MI
20 years ago , diabetes mellitus type 2 , coronary artery disease ,
and chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
approximately 1.8 to 2. In the emergency room , she was given 2
mg of Dilaudid IV for pain plus another 1 mg IV as well as Zofran
1 mg IV. An NG tube was placed , and hooked to suction , which
drained 1 liter of green fluid that was guaiac negative. CT of
the abdomen and pelvis showed high-grade small-bowel obstruction
with a transition point at the left lower quadrant hernia ,
dilated small-bowel loops , and fat stranding. A second
radiologist per the surgical note said that the transition point
may have actually been distal to the hernia and may have been
located within the pelvis. After surgical evaluation , the
patient was admitted to the floor for conservative medical
management of her small-bowel obstruction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs , temperature
96.4 , pulse 84 , blood pressure 132/70 , respiratory rate 14 , and
sat 97% on room air. The patient was pale , ill appearing with an
NG tube in place. Her cardiac exam revealed an S3 gallop. PMI
was displaced and sustained. Heart rate was regular in rate and
rhythm. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Abdomen was distended
and tender , no rebound or guarding. The left lower quadrant
hernia was approximately 15 cm in size and reducible. The ostomy
was without any output. Neurological exam revealed no focal
deficits or facial droops.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: None.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. GI: The patient presented with a small-bowel obstruction.
The point of transition was thought to be in the pelvis by the
second Radiology opinion , she was kept n.p.o. , NG tube to
suction. SBO resolved on 4/4/05 . Her abdominal exam improved.
Her pain improved. At the time of discharge , her ostomy was
putting out green stool. Lactate levels were followed , with a
peak of 1.4 and then back down to 0.8. The patient was kept on
an IV proton pump inhibitor , then switched to p.o. At the time
of discharge , her diet was being advanced as tolerated. She was
tolerating a mechanical soft diet.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient has CHF with an EF of 15 to 20%.
She was gently hydrated during the small-bowel obstruction. Her
digoxin was continued. Her beta-blocker was switched to
Lopressor. Her diuretics were held. Her hydralazine and Isordil
were held as well as her aspirin in the event that she should go
to the operating room. These were added back. At the time of
discharge , she was on Coreg , hydralazine , Isordil , digoxin , and
aspirin at her home doses. Diuretic can be added back for
diuresis , once the patient is taking improved p.o.'s. The
patient had several runs of V-TAC and frequent PVCs on the
monitor. Her electrolytes were corrected for a potassium of 4
and magnesium of 2. She was asymptomatic with these rhythms.
Her heart rate was in the 90s. Her blood pressure was in the
110s/50s-70s at the time of discharge.
3. Endocrine: The patient was continued on 15 units of NPH
q.a.m. , 7 units of NPH q.p.m. , as well as a Regular Insulin
sliding scale for very strict glucose control. This regimen
resulted in occasional episodes of hypoglycemia to 33 and 44
respectively. The patient was symptomatic with a blood sugar of
33. She received an amp of D50 and her blood sugar improved. Her
regimen was adjusted at the time of discharge , she was on NPH 8
units subcu q.a.m. and a Regular Insulin sliding scale. Her NPH
should be titrated as her oral intake improves. The patient is
on chronic prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis. She was switched
to hydrocortisone 10 mg IV q.8h. She did not require a stressed
dose. She was switched back to her oral dose of prednisone.
4. Renal: The patient's phenol on presentation was 0.25. Her
creatinine was 2.8 , which was elevated from her baseline after
discharge at Ketchwo of 2.4. Her creatinine rose to 3.3 and
then began to trend down. Her creatinine was 2.4 and then 2.3 on
the day of discharge. Her acute on chronic renal failure was
thought to represent dehydration as well as poor forward flow due
to third spacing and decreased intravascular volumes. Her blood
pressures tended to be on the low side when she was first
admitted. These improved with rehydration to the point where her
home blood pressure medications could be restarted.
5. ID: The patient was started on levofloxacin 500 mg IV
q.4-8h. and Flagyl 500 mg IV q.8h. for an elevated white count on
admission of 14.65 with 87.3% neutrophils. Her blood cultures
from 6/12/05 were positive , two out of four bottles in 24 hours
for Gram-positive cocci identified as MRSA. She was started on
vancomycin 1 gm IV q.48h. This will need to be continued for a
total of two weeks , start day 6/20/05 , stop day 8/7/06 .
Levofloxacin and Flagyl were started on 7/11/05 , stop date
4/16/06 . The patient remained afebrile and her bands trended
down from a peak of 39 to 3 the day prior to discharge.
6. Rheumatologic: The patient was continued on steroids for
rheumatoid arthritis and chronic steroid dependence.
7. Neuro: The patient had episodes of disorientation , likely
due to sundowning two days prior to placement. She required 0.5
mg of IV Haldol for extreme agitation. She also required
trazodone 100 mg p.o. q.h.s. for sleep.
8. Physical therapy: The patient was out of bed to chair. She
typically walks with a walker. She will require rehabilitation
for improved coordination and strength.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient was on proton pump inhibitor and
Lovenox during the course of her stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Pending.
The remainder of the dictation will be completed at the time of
discharge.

****************************************
62 y/o woman w/ MRSA UTI.
1 ) UTI: initially rx w/ bactrim but we d/cd this 2/2 elev Cr ,
electrolye abnormalities and switched to vancomycin on which her
symptoms improved. Thus , we had a PICC line inserted so she cou
ld complete a 14 day course of antibiotics for this complicated
MRSA+ UTI. Blood cxs were drawn to r/o bacteremia given her low grade
temps and were neg to date. We also gave her 3 days of pyridium for sx
relief. The patient will hang her own vancomycin at home.
2 ) Renal insufficiency: baseline 50/2.5; checked urine lytes which
suggested patient was dry and we initiated gentle hydration given
her underlying CHF. This and teh blood we gave her have helped her Cr
return to baseline. Renal US normal. She did have hematuria which may h
ave been 2/2 the foley , though she also had some mild urinary retention
and we are suggesting an outpt cystoscopy.
3 )CV: We were holding her ACE + diuretic until her last day of
admission due to her volume status and Cr elev. we monitored her BP
off of these meds which was stable; We continued her coumadin and her
INR was stable. We restarted her ACE and diuretic( but d/cd her on 2mg
qd of bumex instead of 2 bid which she came in on ).
4 ) DM: we continued her home insulin and her FS were well controlled
on this regimen
5 ) Dispo: w/ PICC line and abx for 10 more days. Pt should follow up
with Dr. Schupbach her PCP.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take your medications as prescribed and listed on the discharge
papers , including your vancomycin.
Please be sure to contact Dr. Lapinski to set up an appointment.
If you being to re-experience severe burning again with urination or if
you begin to get high fevers , please call your doctor or return to the

Discharge Date: 8/10/2005
ATTENDING: LEIFER , JEFFEREY GRAHAM MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Endocarditis , urinary tract infection.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Mitral regurgitation , diabetes ,
hypertension , congestive heart failure , recurrent UTIs , uterine
prolapse , hyperlipidemia , hiatal hernia , right breast nodule.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old with a
history of severe mitral regurgitation , history of congestive
heart failure with an ejection fraction of 60% in 6/8 , chronic
abdominal discomfort , history of recurrent UTIs , and uterine
prolapse , who one week prior to admission developed increased
nausea , decreased appetite , weakness , fatigue and increased low
back pain. No vomiting , diarrhea , cough , or dysuria. On
presentation , the patient was found to be hypotensive , in septic
shock , with bacteremia in urinary tract infection and admitted to
the Medical ICU for pressure support.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for heart rate of 94 ,
blood pressure of 80-90/50. Notable for heart exam with regular
rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , with 3/6 systolic crescendo
murmur and decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border
radiating to the clavicles and carotids , and 3/6 holosystolic
murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla , and an apical heave.
JVP flat. Chest with crackles in the right middle lung fields and
leg basilar crackles. Abdominal exam was benign. Guaiac
negative. Extremities with no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema and
1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
RELEVANT STUDIES AND TESTS: Blood culture on 10/13
Streptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin MIC
0.19. Urine culture on 10/13 Greater than 100 , 000 Klebsiella
pneumoniae , ampicillin resistant , gentamicin sensitive , and
levofloxacin sensitive. TEE on 10/17 Severe mitral
regurgitation , posterior leaflet with mitral calcifications and
linear density concerning for endocarditis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
IMPRESSION: A 76-year-old female with mitral regurgitation ,
history of CHF , history of recurrent UTI , who presented with
nausea and chills , had hypotension requiring a medical ICU stay x
2 days , with Streptococcus viridans bacteremia and mitral
calcifications in linear density concerning for endocarditis plus
Klebsiella UTI.
1. Infectious disease: The patient presented with chills and
hypotension and was admitted to the MICU from the ED for
treatment of septic shock. Her mean arterial pressures were kept
above 65 with Levophed. She initially was treated with
levofloxacin and vancomycin to treat Gram-positive cocci
bacteremia and UTI. Blood culture from 5/15 , grew out
Streptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin MIC
0.19. Urine culture was positive for Klebsiella , ampicillin
resistant , gentamicin and levofloxacin sensitive. On 1/11 ,
antibiotics were changed to penicillin 3 million units IV q.4h.
and gentamicin 50 mg IV q.8h. ATEE on 5/29 showed severe mitral
regurgitation with posterior leaflet calcifications and linear
density concerning for endocarditis. Therefore , a PICC line was
placed on 10/11 for continuation of a six-week course of
penicillin 3 million units IV q.4h. until 1/3 and two-week
course of gentamicin 50 mg IV q.8h. until 9/12 .  She will follow
up in the Infectious Disease Clinic with Dr. Ramiro Halcom on
1/5/05 at 8 a.m.
2. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was maintained on
aspirin. Lipitor was initially helped for an initial
transaminitis presumed to be secondary to shock liver , that at
the time of discharge her liver enzymes had normalized and she
was restarted on her Lipitor. Pump: The patient has a history
of congestive heart failure , with an ejection fraction 60% in
6/8 .  She had hypotension , requiring Levophed until 2/5 .  She
had an episode of flash pulmonary edema on 6/16 in the setting
of fluid bolus and one unit of packed red blood cells. She has a
very attenuatus balance between preload dependence and overload.
Her Lasix and ACE-I were held while she was hypotensive. Because
her systolic blood pressure continued to be low in the 90s and
low 100s , attempt was not made to re-add the ACE while in the
hospital. It is anticipated that her cardiologist and outpatient
physicians will attempt to add the ACE back onto her medical
regimen for better afterload reduction as her blood pressure
tolerates. The patient also has a very severe mitral
regurgitation , which would be one of the reasons that an ACE on
her medication regimen would be beneficial. Rhythm: The patient
was maintained on telemetry , and was found to be a normal sinus
rhythm with ectopy , including short once of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia. She was started on Lopressor 12.5 mg
t.i.d. on 1/11 , and this was increased to 25 mg b.i.d. at
discharge , with her heart rates continuing to be between the 70s
and the 90s , however , with less episodes of ectopy. Her
electrolytes were also well repleted.
3. Gastrointestinal: The patient had evidence of shock liver
( 4/10 with an ALT of 135 , AST of 177 , alkaline phosphatase of
251 , and T bili of 1.7 ) that is now resolving. Lipitor was held ,
and was started as a transaminitis resolved. Non-contrast CT of
the abdomen showed biliary sludge and gallstones , no evidence of
acute cholecystitis. Right upper quadrant ultrasound confirmed
the CT findings. Colon cancer is a concern with the patient's
anemia being new since 5/8 .  Her last colonoscopy was in 2000 ,
and she will benefit from repeat colonoscopy as an outpatient.
She was continued on Nexium for prophylaxis. Heme: The patient
had guaiac positive stools in the medical ICU , her hematocrit was
stable around 33%. She has a microcytic anemia with an MCV of
79 , her iron studies ( iron of 10 , TIBC of 191 , ferritin is 744 )
suggesting anemia of chronic disease with possibly overlying iron
deficiency.
4. Endocrine: The patient had a normal random cortisol level of
35.3. She had an uncertain diagnosis of diabetes and was on the
Portland protocol in the medical ICU. Hemoglobin A1c , however ,
was 6.5. Therefore , she was maintained thereafter only on
insulin sliding scale and rarely required any coverage.
5. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on Lovenox and Protonix.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , iron sulfate 325 mg
daily , gentamicin sulfate 50 mg IV q.8h. until 9/12 for a
two-week course , penicillin G potassium 3 million units IV q.4h.
until 1/3 for a six-week course , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. ,
Caltrate plus D2 tablets p.o. daily , Lipitor 10 mg daily , and
Protonix 40 mg daily. The patient has not been restarted on her
home Lasix and lisinopril secondary to persistently low blood
pressures between the 90s and 100s. It is anticipated that
especially her Lisinopril and her Lasix will be added back on to
her medical regimen as her blood pressure tolerates. Given that
she was no longer on Lasix , she was also taken potassium
chloride.
DISPOSITION: The patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation
at Acanmingpeerra Virg Tantblu Medical Center in order to be able to get her antibiotic
therapy. She was discharged on stable condition.
PHYSICIANS FOLLOW-UP: The patient has been following follow-up
appointments:
1. Stress test in 2/6/05 at 3 p.m.
2. Dr. Gale Montante ( general cardiology ) on 7/10/05 at 10 a.m.
3. Dr. Ed Storti 3/22/05 at 12 p.m.
4. Dr. Stacey Koers ( infectious disease ) 1/5/05 at 8 a.m.
The patient will follow up regarding the success of her
antibiotic therapy. It is also anticipated that her cardiologist
will re-add back on her ACE for better afterload reduction as her
blood pressures tolerates , and potentially we will add her back
on to the Lasix as well. She will require weekly lab draws to
check her electrolytes and CBC while she is on the antibiotics.
CONSULTANTS: Infectious disease , Dr. Rupert Zenon , pager
number 55757.
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Dr. Abel Guignard .
The patient is full code. Her family is aware of the situation.

SERVICE: Cardiology Team VT
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Geoffrey D. Heebsh MD , PHD.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
LIST OF PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , status post
myocardial infarction; diabetes mellitus; hypertension;
hypothyroidism; and anxiety.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , this is an 82-year-old male
with a history of CHF with an EF 10% to 15% who is status post
MI , history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and
hypothyroidism. There is also a question of a history of atrial
fibrillation as well.
In the past 2 months , the patient had complaints of increasing
dyspnea on exertion with being unable to walk from one end of the
room to the other without becoming short of breath; a mild weight
gain of 3 pounds as well; and a stable , 2-pillow orthopnea.
On August , 2005 , the patient awakened from sleep with a sudden
onset of shortness of breath and chest pressure associated with
nausea and vomiting. The patient presented to an outside
hospital emergency department where his blood pressure was
stable , and he was saturating 94% on room air. He was treated
with IV Lopressor and nitroglycerin , sublingual and topical. He
was admitted at that hospital , and Cardiology was consulted who
diagnosed him with a mild CHF by his physical examination. A
chest x-ray was with bibasilar opacities that were more likely
atelectasis. The patient was ruled out for an MI at that
hospital and treated with Lasix at the home doses of Lasix 40 mg
p.o. b.i.d. with stable systolic blood pressures of 100s to 110s.
His course at that hospital was complicated by a nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia through which he was asymptomatic. He
was started on Lovenox b.i.d. for a low EF.
The patient was transferred to the Laismode Hospital
on May , 2005 , for elective placement of an AICD.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Atrial fibrillation , anxiety , CHF with an
EF of 10% to 15% , MI , diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,
hypothyroidism , status post cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis ,
and a history of probable prostate ??___??.
MEDICATIONS: The patient's home medications had included Lasix
40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , KCl 10 mEq q.d. , glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. ,
Levoxyl 150 mcg q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg
q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , atenelol 25 mg p.o. q.d. ,
trazodone 50 mg to 100 mg q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , and Ativan 0.5
mg p.r.n.
Transfer medications include digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , levothyroxine
150 mcg q.d. , glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 20
mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
atenelol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , KCl 10 mEq
p.o. q.d. , trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and Ativan 0.5 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , and there is a question whether the patient was currently
on Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneously b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is an ex-smoker and quit smoking
greater than 20 years ago. He lives with his wife.
FAMILY HSITORY: Both the parents of the patient are with a CAD
in their 70s.
PHYSICAL EXAMIANTION: The patient's vital signs upon arriving on
the floor; temperature was 94.5 , pulse was 64 , blood pressure was
120/60 , respirations were 20 , and he was saturating 98% on room
air. Examination was remarkable for JVP at his jaw and moist
mucous membranes. Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with
frequent ectopy and S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4. The lungs were with a
faint left bibasilar crackles. Abdomen was benign. The
extremities were with no pitting edema but slightly cool
bilaterally. Neurological examination is nonfocal.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Remarkable for a creatinine of 0.9.
CBC was unremarkable. BNP was 2035. INR was 1.3 , and PTT was
37.4.
Of note , an echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital on
July , 2005 , showed an EF of 10% to 15% , moderate left atrial
enlargement , right atrial enlargement , mild to moderate aortic
regurgitation , mild MR and mild TR , and pulmonary artery
pressures of 45.
An ETT myoview performed at the outside hospital showed a large
fixed defect inferiorly and inferolaterally as well as a mild
ischemia in the lateral wall.
EKG at the outside hospital performed on July , 2005 , was with
sinus rhythm; right bundle-branch block with T wave inversion in
V1 through V4; Q waves in II , III , and aVF; first-degree AV
block; and a question of a left anterior fascicular block.
A chest x-ray at the outside hospital on August , 2005 , was with
bibasilar opacities with a question of atelectasis versus
pneumonia.
Admission EKG here on May , 2005 , was unchanged from the
outside hospital.
Admission chest x-ray on done on May , 2005 , showed
cardiomegaly and mild bilateral costophrenic angle blunting.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Subjectively , this is an 82-year-old male with
a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 10% to 15% status post myocardial infarction , hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus , and hypothyroidism who was transferred to the
Las Health Network for an elective automatic
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. The patient had no active
ischemia. He does have a history of a myocardial infarction ,
which was inferior in area. His ETT-MIBI was with mild lateral
wall ischemia with a large fixed inferior and inferolateral
defect. The patient was continued on aspirin , ACE inhibitor , and
statin and restarted on his beta-blocker. A catheterization was
performed on May , 2005 , which demonstrated a left dominant
system and no significant left main or left anterior descending
artery lesions. A left posterior descending artery had an 80%
lesion in the mid posterior descending artery. Ejection fraction
was estimated at 15% with global hypokinesis and dilated left
atrium and dilated left ventricle. The patient had elevated
wedge pressure of 42 and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
2. Pump: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
On admission , he was volume overloaded with a BNP of 2035. On
admission , the patient was treated with Lasix , Isordil , ACE
inhibitor , and digoxin. Hydralazine was added. A
catheterization on May , 2005 , demonstrated elevated left
heart-filling pressures. The patient was diuresed subsequently
with more than 4 liters and was euvolemic upon discharge. The
patient is currently euvolemic on p.o. Lasix to being slightly
dry. Given increased CO2 but a normal BUN and creatinine , we
have changed the patient's Lasix dose to 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 40
mg p.o. q.p.m. upon discharge. Given the systolic blood
pressures in the 90s and 100s , the patient's lisinopril was
changed to 20 mg p.o. q.d. The patient is to be followed by VNA
at home to monitor blood pressure.
3. Rhythm: The patient was followed by EP. His admission
electrocardiogram showed a right bundle-branch block with a
question of left anterior fascicular block and a first-degree
arteriovenous block. On October , 2005 , the patient became
suddenly bradycardic to the 30s and 40s with nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia x30 beats and a new second-degree
arteriovenous block type 1. The patient was asymptomatic
throughout this. Zoll pads were placed , and atropine was put at
the bedside. On August , 2005 , the patient appeared to be back in
normal sinus rhythm. On August , 2005 , a pacemaker with automatic
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed with cardiac
resynchronization therapy as well. This was interrogated on June , 2005 , and the ??___?? were confined. The patient will follow
up with Dr. Valko in EP on July , 2005 , at 10:20 a.m. The
patient is to avoid vigorous activity.
4. Endocrine: The patient is with diabetes mellitus and was
covered with regular insulin sliding scale here. He was advised
to restart on his home dose of glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. upon
discharge. The patients' history of hypothyroidism and thyroid
function test is consistent with sick euthyroid syndrome. He was
continued on levothyroxine at his home dose.
5. Psychiatry: The patient is given trazodone and Ativan q.h.s.
p.r.n. The patient's mental status was somewhat decreased on the
night of August , 2005 , status post automatic implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator placement. He was not oriented to
time. This later resolved by the evening of September , 2005.
6. Genitourinary: The patient was noted to have bloody urine
after receiving heparin during the catheterization thought
secondary to Foley trauma. There were no clots; however , given
significant hematuria , ??___?? Foley was placed and bladder
irrigation was started. Urinalysis was negative. Urine was pink
colored by the night of September , 2005. The Foley was discontinued
due to a leakage. This was not replaced given good urine output ,
continued pink-colored urine , and no clots. The patient's
hematocrit was stable throughout this.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was given pneumoboots given the new
automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement and
hematuria.
8. Infectious Disease: The patient is to be on clindamycin for
7 days status post pacemaker placement.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol 12.5 mg
p.o. q.d. , clindamycin 300 mg p.o. q.i.d. through May , 2005 ,
digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. and Lasix 40
mg p.o. q.p.m. , hydralazine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , levothyroxine 150
mcg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Ativan 0.5 mg p.o.
q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
insomnia , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. ,
glyburide 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. , magnesium oxide 800 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
and KCl slow release 20 mEq p.o. q.d.
DIET: The patient's diet on discharge; the patient should
measure weight daily; continue a low-cholesterol , low-fat , and
low-sodium diet , ADA 2100 calories per day.
ACTIVITIES: No vigorous activity of the left arm for 1 month and
no lifting of the left arm above the shoulder. The patient
should not drive until a followup appointment.
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: The patient is to see Dr. Isaias Topper
and Landon Ducayne , nurse practitioner. The clinic will call the
patient with his appointment time. The patient is to see Dr.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Aortic valve stenosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 75-year-old gentleman with a
history of coronary artery disease who is status post CABG in
1983 who has recently experienced unstable angina and was
admitted in April of 2006 to Omill Mang Medical Center Of for
workup and was found to have an aortic valve area of 0.8 and
significant vein graft disease to OM1. The patient received
coronary stents to OM1 and the native circumflex at Palclean Center in April of 2006. Of note , the right coronary artery was
seen to be occluded at that time as was the vein graft to that
coronary. The vein graft to the LAD had been priorly stented and
was noted to be patent. The patient began developing shortness
of breath and symptoms of aortic stenosis , which were complicated
by anemia , which was thought to have developed due to some AV
malformations of the foregut. In view of the patient's
progressive symptoms , it was decided to proceed with aortic valve
replacement , which was first scheduled for September , but then
rescheduled when the patient was noted to have coughing and
hemoptysis. The patient was treated for pneumonia surgery
rescheduled and he is admitted to Ingfrisdam Rywilf Health
for reoperation aortic valve replacement.

hypotensive following surgery , which was refractory to pressors
and volume requiring pressor boluses and transient application of
chest compressions and the patient underwent placement of an
intraaortic balloon pump. The balloon pump was weaned and
removed by postoperative day 2 and pressors were weaned by
postoperative day 3. The patient transferred to the Step-Down
Unit later on postoperative day #3 and continued to progress
daily. His diet was advanced to full house diet and was well
tolerated. The patient was started on beta-blockade , aspirin and
statin for his coronary artery disease and a course of
antibiotics was completed for a preoperative urinary tract
infection The patient was followed perioperatively by the
Diabetes Management Service for tight glycemic control. The
patient was weaned off of supplemental oxygen with ongoing
diuresis and he remained in sinus rhythm and saturated well on
room air for the remainder of his stay. The patient's
preoperative Flomax was restarted following the removal of Foley
catheter. The patient initially had difficulty voiding and then
voided without difficulty. He has been instructed to follow up
with his home neurologist within the next few weeks and earlier
if he has difficulties. The remainder of his postoperative stay
was uncomplicated and he is discharged to Rehab in good condition

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Eric Christinsen is a 79-year-old gentleman with extensive history of
coronary artery disease who has previously undergone a coronary
artery bypass graft x2. Also , several percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasties and stents of his saphenous vein graft to
his first diagonal coronary artery in 1999. He also received a
stent to his left subclavian due to total occlusion and a stent
and angioplasty of the left brachial artery. He has a history of

exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and more frequent episodes
of substernal chest pressure. Aortic valve area had reached the
value of 0.4 cm2. During her previous admission in September 2005 ,
he underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed left main
coronary artery disease and three vessels with evidence of
restenosis. At that time , he underwent successful stenting to
his left main coronary artery and a successful PTCA and stenting
two saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending coronary
artery. Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50% ,
aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 23 mmHg , a peak gradient

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Alex Chumley was brought to the operating room on 1/14/05 where he
underwent an elective reoperation aortic valve replacement with a
23 mm Mosaic valve. Total bypass time was 119 minutes , total
crossclamp time was 69 minutes. Intraoperatively , the patient
was cannulated via the right axillary artery and left femoral
vein. A sternotomy was performed while on coronary pulmonary
bypass without incident. He was found to have a trileaflet
calcified aortic valve , which was excised after transverse
aortotomy. The patient did well intraoperatively , came off
bypass without incident , was brought up to the Intensive Care
Unit in normal sinus rhythm and stable condition.
Postoperatively , the patient did very well. He was extubated and
transferred to Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #1. He did
receive transfusion of 2 units packed red blood cells for
postoperative anemia. His Plavix , aspirin and Coumadin was
restarted for his atrial fibrillation. Heath Uren was also found
to have an air leak from his chest tube and also did begin to
have some postoperative confusion on postoperative day #2. His
narcotics were discontinued. His chest tube air leak resolved ,
and the chest tubes were removed without incident. Post-pull
chest x-ray showed no pneumothorax. On postoperative day #3 , the
patient continued with his confusion requiring a sitter.
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended to restart his
preoperative benzodiazepine and Haldol in the evening. He was

diabetes , obesity with ICD/biventricular pacer , CHF with EF of
15% was admitted to an outside hospital initially for a fall and
was subsequently found to have decompensated heart failure and
hyponatremia. The patient was then transferred to Memoff Deelaen's Hospital for further treatment. At the time of the fall , the
patient was not presyncopal , likely due to possibly feeling weak.
At the hospital , the patient received p.o. Lasix and then IV
Lasix with little success in treating CHF. The patient was found
to have sodium level of 117 , hydrochlorothiazide was then
withheld and the patient was restricted on fluids. Of note , the
patient comes in on Coumadin therapy secondary to having a CVA in
10/5 with no residual symptoms while off Coumadin. The

HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 65-year-old female with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy ,
CHF with EF of 15% and on a biventricular pacer , ICD , diabetes ,
obesity , admitted from outside hospital for treatment of
hyponatremia and decompensated heart failure.
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Pump: The patient initially was in significant decompensated
heart failure. As a result , the patient was immediately started
on diuretics with torsemide IV 100 mg twice a day with a goal of
-1 to -2 liters daily. Daily weights and strict I & Os were
monitored daily. The patient was also placed on 1 liter free
water restriction and 2 liters fluid restriction. Digoxin levels
were shown to be in normal range. The patient was continued on
digoxin , Isordil , and thiazides were held secondary to patient's
hyponatremia. Over the hospital course , the patient's
hyponatremia improved significantly and gradually back up in to
the 130s. The patient continued to diurese well initially with a
weight of 83.5 kilograms. At the time of discharge , the
patient's weight was approximately 273 kilograms. The patient
also continued to show much improvement in terms of energy level.
Subjectively , the patient felt better. Zestril was also slowly
added to patient's CHF regimen. At the time of discharge ,
Zestril 10 mg per day was added. A beta-blocker was also added ,
specifically Coreg at 3.125 mg twice daily , Aldactone 25 mg once
daily was also added to the regimen. In terms of diuresis
initially , the patient was on 100 mg b.i.d. p.o. torsemide and at
one point was switched to Lasix drip as the patient was not
responding to diuretics. Eventually the patient was transitioned
back to an oral regimen with torsemide ultimately at 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d.
Echocardiogram was also performed which showed significant mitral
regurgitation with reversal of flow in the pulmonary venous
system. As a result , there was consideration and discussion
about mitral valve replacement. The patient is amenable to
procedure performed by Dr. Mcgrue This will be discussed and
coordinated by his office and him. This will be a percutaneous
procedure possibly.
The patient's electrolytes were monitored twice daily as the
patient was actively being diuresed. Electrolytes were repleted
p.r.n.
B. Rhythm: The patient has no active arrhythmias. However , the
patient's ICD and biventricular pacemaker was found to be towards
end of life and required replacement. As a result , although not
urgent during this admission , ICD/biventricular pacer was
replaced by Dr. Neuse on 4/20/05. The patient tolerated the
procedure very well with no complications. The patient's ICD
pocket was checked for any signs of pocket hematoma or other
complications. The patient is stable and new ICD/pacer is
functioning properly. No signs of bleeding or infection.
C. Ischemia: There are no active issues. EKGs demonstrated no
signs of cardiac ischemia. The patient was chest pain free
throughout the hospitalization.
2. Endocrine: The patient's home regimen was held and the
patient was continued only on a insulin sliding scale after meals
and at bedtime. Fingersticks demonstrated good sugar control.
Fingersticks were managed mostly between 100 and 120.
3. FEN: The patient was on diabetic diet. The patient was also
checked twice daily for electrolytes and repleted for magnesium
and potassium scale. Sodium was also monitored as the patient
was initially admitted for hyponatremia. As a result , all
thiazides were held.
4. Hematology: The patient had a home dose of Coumadin 5 mg
Monday , Wednesday , Friday. The patient's regimen was continued
as inpatient and was slightly modified eventually to
approximately 2 to 2.5 mg once daily. INR was maintained
therapeutic throughout the hospitalization. ICD replacement
procedure per Dr. Bjella The patient was continued with the
foal INR between 2.0 to 2.5.
5. Psyche/Neuro: Continued patient's home regimen of Xanax ,
Neurontin and pain medication to control chronic back pain.
6. Prophylaxis: For DVT prophylaxis , the patient was on Coumadin
with therapeutic INR. For GI prophylaxis , the patient was placed
on Nexium.
Physical therapy consult was also called to evaluate the
patient's functional status. The patient also underwent regular
physical therapy sessions inhouse to improve functional status.
ID: The patient's UA demonstrated possible evidence for urinary
tract infection. This may also have contributed to patient's
decompensated heart failure and also initial complaints of
feeling weak. Urine culture demonstrated that the patient had
citrobacter that was sensitive to ciprofloxacin. As a result ,
the patient was started on a course of ciprofloxacin. The
patient was also placed in isolation as the strain was resistant
to gentamicin. The patient after treatment was taken off contact
isolation. The patient was afebrile. Vital signs were stable
with no complaints of dysuria , chills , or fevers throughout
hospitalization. Subsequent UA demonstrated evidence that
urinary tract infection was adequately treated.
DISPOSITION:
The patient to follow up with home cardiologist within one to two
weeks. After discharge , the patient will also follow up with Dr.
Iturbe to discuss further treatment of mitral valve
regurgitation. After Coumadin follow up and INR blood draws , the
patient will follow up with primary care doctor.

ATTENDING: KEVIN DEPIPPO MD
PRIMARY MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:
Congestive heart failure.
OTHER MEDICAL DIAGNOSES:
Morbid obesity , hypothyroidism , hypertension , history of poor
adherence to medical regimen.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with medical history as
mentioned above and history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy with her
last echocardiogram in 6/22 showing ejection fraction of 35-45%.
She presents with approximately 1.5 weeks of increasing
shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. The patient denies
chest pain , fevers or chills but does say that she has had sore
throat and a cough for approximately one week. The cough is
productive of clear frothy sputum. The patient reports
compliance with most of her medicines but states that she is not
taking Synthroid and lisinopril because these medications make
her feel bad. She also reports eating submarine sandwiches for
the past week secondary to difficulty shopping and doing her
cooking at home. She does not measure her daily weights. She
states that in addition to the Synthroid and lisinopril , she is
unsure of her other medical regimen as she has run out of some of
her medicines at home.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
As above.
ALLERGIES:
Ampicillin causes a rash.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient has two adult children at home and reports that she
drinks approximately 1/2-1 pint of ethanol over 2-3 days and
binges that occur approximately two times per month.
ADMISSION DATA:
Vital signs: Temperature 97 , pulse 76 , blood pressure 150s/80s.
note that one read with a small cuff read a blood pressure of
200/100 , this was believed to be secondary to inefficient cuff
size. Oxygen saturation 94% on room air. In general , the
patient is morbidly obese , in no acute distress , slowly
responsive to questions with frequent staring episodes. HEENT
exam was significant for mild pharyngeal erythema without
exudates. Neck exam was significant for no lymphadenopathy.
Jugular venous pressure was elevated although it is difficult to
assess secondary to body habitus. Lungs showed clear breath
sounds although a few crackles were present at the left base.
Abdomen was morbidly obese but did have active bowel sounds and
was nontender. Extremities showed significant subcutaneous fatty
tissue , however , there was no pitting edema. Extremities were
warm throughout. Dermatologic exam was significant for dry skin
and thin eyebrows. Neuro exam revealed 3+ biceps reflexes
bilaterally. There was a question of slow relaxation phase.
Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary redistribution. EKG was
unchanged from prior , and showed normal sinus rhythm with a first
degree AV block , left axis deviation , left ventricular
hypertrophy with poor R-wave progression and nonspecific T-wave
abnormalities.
Laboratory values on admission was significant for creatinine of
0.8 , D-dimer was negative at 306 , BNP 2. White blood cell 6.9 ,
hematocrit 43.6 , platelets 170 , 000 , magnesium 1.7 , potassium 3.2 ,
INR 0.9 , PTT 29.3.
INITIAL IMPRESSION:
This is a 58-year-old woman with morbid obesity , dilated
cardiomyopathy and hypothyroidism in the setting of poor medical
compliance , admitted with likely multifactorial dyspnea on
exertion and mild congestive heart failure and decompensation.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Pump: The patient presented with an elevated JVP in the setting
of a negative BNP. However the clinical exam was more consistent
with mild failure and the patient was diuresed with 80 mg of IV
Lasix. She responded to this dose with good urine output and
stable renal function test. However , secondary to stress
incontinence and difficulty measuring JVP , the patient was
slightly over diuresed while inhouse resulting in an increasing
BUN to creatinine ratio. On her final day of her
hospitalization , all diuretics were held and the patient was
discharged on her usual regimen of diuretics including Lasix 80
mg once per day. The patient had been noncompliant with her
lisinopril secondary to throat symptoms and reportedly some
lightheadedness. Therefore she was changed to Cozaar 50 mg at
the time of discharge. The patient's discharge weight was 141.5
kg and this was estimated to be dry weight for the patient at
this time.
Rhythm: The patient had first degree AV block that was stable
from old EKGs. She was monitored on telemetry throughout her
hospital stay. There were no significant events on telemetry
during this hospitalization.
Ischemia: Rule out MI protocol was initiated in the ED secondary
to vague symptoms. This was continued and the patient ruled out
with serial negative cardiac enzymes x 3. there was no
suggestion of ischemic by ECG criteria as well.
2. Endocrine: The patient has a long history of noncompliance
with her thyroid hormone replacement and was clearly hypothyroid
on this admission. However , secondary to difficulty with blood
draws , thyroid function tests that were ordered were not obtained
on this admission and should be obtained as an outpatient in the
near future. the patient was encouraged to continue taking her
thyroid medicine as this may help improve her overall functional
status in addition to her cardiomyopathy.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. , potassium chloride
20 mEq p.o. q.d. , Prozac 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Ventolin 2 puffs
aerosol as needed , levothyroxine 225 mcg p.o. q.d. , multivitamin tablet
p.o. q.d. , Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Flonase 1-2 puffs in the
nose twice a day , Advair Diskus one puff twice a day , Aldactone
one tablet p.o. q.d. , atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
FOLLOWUP PLANS:
The patient will have a followup in SNOWEST HOSPITAL clinic with her primary
care provider , the day following discharge , since Wednesday
8/6/05. at this time , routine chem-7 can be obtained to
evaluate for improvement in renal function and electrolyte
status. The patient will followup with her cardiologist , Dr.
Roik at her regularly scheduled intervals. Tests pending at the
time of discharge , the patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram
performed which is pending at the time of this dictation. The
patient is discharged to home with services in good condition.

8. Penicillin.
PREVIOUS STUDIES:
1. Echocardiogram 7/7/2005: Ejection fraction 65-70% , mild
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , aortic valve was
thickened , stenotic , peak gradient 58 ( mean 33 ) , AVA 0.74 , mild
mitral regurgitation , mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation
( regurgitant velocity 3.2 m/s , pulmonary artery systolic pressure
40+ right atrial pressure ) , trace-to-mild pulmonic regurgitation.
2. Pulmonary function test 2/8/2006: FVC 31% , FEV1 23
percent , FEV1/FVC 77%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On admission , 5/25/2006 , the patient's weight on admission was
130 kg. Her vital signs are as follows , temperature 95.8 , pulse
67 in atrial fibrillation , blood pressure 126/Doppler , the
patient had respiratory rate of 20 and an O2 saturation 95% on 4
liters. In general , the patient was in no acute distress ,
speaking in full sentences. Examination of the neck revealed JVP
to the ear , weak/weight carotid upstrokes , no bruits.
Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregular rhythm with an
S1 and weak S2. A 4/6 crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur was
heard best at the right upper sternal border radiating to the
carotids. Lung examination revealed crackles that heard at the
way up bilaterally with decreased breath sounds throughout. The
patient's abdomen was obese , but soft and nontender. Examination
of her extremities revealed a parvus at tardus. Lower extremity
pulses could not be palpated due to edema. The patient had 4+
lower extremity edema. Examination of the left shin showed
erythema , pain , swelling with a 2 x 2 cm ulcer on the left
anterior shin. The ulcer appeared clean , dry and intact with no
drainage.
STUDIES AT OUAH:
1. EKG on 5/25/2006 showed atrial fibrillation at 63 beats per
minute with a normal axis and poor R-wave progression.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. The patient presented in gross volume overload: We attempted
to diurese the patient with intravenous torsemide. Gradually ,
the dose of torsemide was increased from 100 twice a day to 200
twice a day. At the time of this dictation; however , the
patient's weight had decreased only to 124.6 kg. Her admission
weight on 7/15/2006 was 130 kg. However , this weight was
recorded in the bed ( not standing ). Her first standing weight
was recorded on 8/19/2006 at 125 kg. Her lower extremity edema
only mildly improved , however , at the time of this dictation , the
patient was able to put her shoes on , which she was unable to do
prior to admission. During this diuresis , the patient's
potassium was repleted twice a day. She was also maintained on
Aldactone and acetazolamide ( for elevated CO2 levels ). The
patient's lipid profile was measured during this hospitalization
and she had an LDL of 64. She was maintained on Zocor. Aspirin
cannot be administered due to the patient's drug allergy profile.
From a rhythm standpoint , the patient remained in atrial
fibrillation during this hospitalization through 5/18/2006. She
was not anticoagulation , given her history of HIT and history of
gastrointestinal bleed on Coumadin.
2. Pulmonary: The patient was maintained on BiPAP and Flonase
throughout her hospitalization. Her mental status was monitored
closely given her previous MICU stay during her last admission
for an elevated pCO2. However , the patient was alert and
oriented x3 during her hospitalization.
3. Renal: The patient's creatinine was stable at approximately
1.1 during her diuresis through 10/30/2006.
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was maintained on Nexium
during her hospitalization. Her hematocrit remained stable at
approximately 32.4.
5. Endocrinology: The patient was maintained on Levoxyl and her
home NPH regimen.
6. Infectious disease: The patient was given vancomycin for
cellulitis on her left shin , which appeared to be improving as
the erythematous area was decreasing from 5/4/206 to
10/30/2006. She was also started on gentamicin on 10/11/2006 for
asymptomatic bacteriuria. The patient's urine culture on
8/19/2006 greater than 100 , 000 colonies of pseudomonas.
CODE STATUS: During this hospitalization , the patient reiterated
that she is a full code. It was discussed with her that she is
difficult and in fact possibly and possible intubation. She was
one time intubated nasally. In any event , she wants all life
saving measures performed. At the time of this dictation , she is
a full code ( healthcare proxy Harry Behran , phone number ( 860 ) 377-5068 ).

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Congestive heart failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation , and atrial
fibrillation.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Chest pain x 3 months and shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 75-year-old female with no previous cardiac disease who
presented this morning with chest pain and shortness of breath ,
which had been limiting her over the last month. She had
gastrointestinal surgery earlier this year , complicated by need
for wound infection with revision and debridement.
Before her surgery , she could walk 20 minutes every morning , and
was very active. Over the last month , she has been limited by
shortness of breath , substernal chest pressure , and an overall
decrease in exercise tolerance. She cannot walk across the room
without difficulty now. The pressure in her chest is
nonradiating , is like a pressure rather than sharp , comes
unpredictably with exertion , and is relieved by rest. The
shortness of breath accompanies the pain. The symptoms have been
becoming more severe , and last night , she had rest shortness of
breath and chest pain. This morning she came to the emergency
department because her visiting nurse for her wound care told her
she looked worse and more short of breath and that she should
come to the hospital. She has never had chest pain or shortness
of breath until a little over a month ago , but does take
beta-blockers for a few isolated episodes of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia that she had during her surgery
admission. She sleeps on two pillows every night , which is
chronic but does not get short of breath when flat. She denies
PND , palpitations , weight gain , swelling , or syncopal episodes.
She is a nonsmoker , nondiabetic without high cholesterol that she
knows of. Her chest pain is 2/10 upon admission to the emergency
department and is now 0/10 with nitroglycerin. In the emergency
room , she was given heparin , Plavix , aspirin , beta-blocker ,
Plavix 300 , and oxygen.
REVIEW OF SYSTEM:
She does not have any gastrointestinal symptoms. Her pain is
unrelated to eating. She has no cough , sputum production , and no
history of blood clots. She does not have calf pain , and she has
no neurologic symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Status post bowel resection for diverticulitis , status post
ileostomy take down in 7/21 , status post closure of wound
8/19/04 , and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during last
hospitalization.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Brother with angina at age less than 55.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs: Afebrile , heart rate 83 , blood pressure 113/72 ,
respirations of 18 , and saturation 98% on room air. In general ,
the patient was sitting up comfortable , in no acute distress ,
breathing comfortably. Coronary exam: Regular rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2. Slight murmur diastolic in the axilla. Heart
sounds were distant. Jugular venous pressure at 8 cm.
Pulmonary: Faint crackles inferiorly bilaterally superior 2/3rd
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal exam: Positive
bowel sounds. Wound was covered , some small amount of drainage

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient was thought to have acute coronary
syndrome and was sent to have a left heart catheterization. At
catheterization , she was found to have a large dyskinetic heart and
severe mitral regurgitation but no angiographically significant
coronary artery disease.
Cardiovascular/pump: Echocardiogram on hospital day 2 showed mild to
moderate left ventricular enlargement with moderate mitral
regurgitation and left atrial enlargement. There was only mild
structural mitral valve disease with MAC and leaflet thickening. Left
ventricular systolic function was moderately to severely impaired.
Management for congestive heart failure was pursued with the intention to
reassess LV size , function and MR after optimizing medical therapy. We
began diuresis at this time with 40 mg of IV Lasix. The patient came in
at 64 kilograms and discharge weight and dry weight is 58.0 kilograms.
The patient was also started on ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker as well as
q.d. p.o. Lasix.
Rhythm: The patient developed atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter during this hospitalization with rapid ventricular
response. Heart rate was often into the 150s-160s. We were able
to eventually obtain control with Toprol XL 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,
diltiazem p.o. 30 mg t.i.d. , which was then converted to 45 mg
b.i.d. for an outpatient dosing. The patient was also started on
Coumadin while in hospital. She will follow up in Coumadin
Clinic. The day after discharge , she will have labs drawn to
check her INR. She will be on Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous b.i.d.
until INR becomes therapeutic.
2. Wound care: The patient has open abdominal wound
approximately 2 cm x 2 cm that is followed by Dr. Schoolman , Neville Surgery came by to see Mrs. Lenix in hospital and made
recommendations for wound care. CT scan showed no evidence of entero-
cutaneous fistula. The patient will get follow up wound care at home with
visiting nurses.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
1. Tobacco , 80-pack-year history , quit in 1990.
2. No alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for temperature of
99.2 , heart rate of 121 in sinus tachycardia , blood pressure
116/60 , saturating 98% on room air. She was noted to have a 2/6
systolic murmur at the apex. Lungs were clear bilaterally.
Pulse exam showed no palpable femoral pulses and biphasic
dopplerable pulses bilaterally , DP and PT. Extremities showed
bilateral mottling of all toes and an open 0.5 cm ulceration at
the base of the left fourth toe. All toes are exquisitely tender
to palpation. Sensation is decreased but equal bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This 75-year-old female vasculopath was
admitted for further evaluation of her peripheral vascular
disease which was suspected to be contributing to her new
ulcerations and progressively worsening wrist pain as an
exacerbating factor to likely atheroembolic phenomenon , status
post coronary catheterizations earlier in the year. She was
placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics and plan was made for an MRA
to evaluate her anatomy. Unfortunately , the patient was unable
to tolerate the MR and did experience some mental status changes
that prevented further noninvasive imaging , when she received
some narcotic following her hemodialysis round. Over the ensuing
days she required rather significant doses of Zyprexa and Haldol
to contain agitation and delirium , as the patient would also get
physical and violent. This appeared to sedate her sufficiently
and over the following days , she did manage to calm significantly
and returned to her baseline mental status. She did appear very
emotionally labile throughout the rest of her stay and incredibly
remorseful for previous events. On 6/28/2006 , she was offered
an angiogram to delineate aortic and bilateral lower extremity
runoff anatomy. She did tolerate this well under simple IV
conscious sedation. This showed chronic disease with
collateralization and very poor inflow to the bilateral feet with
essentially one vessel run off on either side. After extensive
discussions with the patient and the patient's family , the
patient did agree to a left femoral to dorsalis pedis bypass
graft which was performed on 9/22/2006 without complication.
Please see the operative note for further details. The patient
did tolerate the procedure well. By time of discharge , she was
tolerating a regular diet and ambulating at baseline with her
rolling walker. The pain was well controlled with minimal
analgesics that were not narcotic based. Cardiology was
consulted during this time to optimize her prior to the OR. Her
primary cardiologist , Dr. Fugle did make some recommendations
including an echocardiogram that showed preserved ejection
fraction and no wall motion abnormalities. Her beta blockade was
titrated up and she was instructed to follow up with cardiology.
She did tolerate hemodialysis throughout this time without undue
difficulty. She did on one occasion experience dyspnea following
hemodialysis that resolved of its own accord , no cardiac events
or in evidence by EKG or by following cardiac enzymes. As the
patient was in stable condition and back to her baseline level of
activity with very strong support at home , she was discharged to
home with services for wound checks and home safety evaluation.
She was instructed to follow up with Dr. Sedlachek in one to two
weeks.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Touchdown weightbearing on the left heel. The patient should
not keep legs in dependent position for more than 10 minutes at a
time. She was to use the walker and a cane as instructed by

Discharge Date: 10/7/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY.
PROBLEM LIST: 1 ) CARDIOMYOPATHY.
2 ) STATUS POST MULTIPLE INJURIES.
3 ) HISTORY OF HEPATITIS B.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 42 year-old gentleman
with dilated cardiomyopathy with
worsening functional status. He was admitted for transplant
work-up , right heart catheterization and optimization of his
medical treatment. He initially developed symptoms approximately
six years prior to admission with complaints of dyspnea and
orthopnea. His chest x-ray at that time demonstrated cardiomegaly
and ultimately an echocardiogram demonstrated dilated
cardiomyopathy. In 1992 , a catheterization was performed with
clean coronary arteries by report. In February of 1994 , he had a
""cerebrovascular accident"". He was on Coumadin at that time. His
symptoms included right hand and face anesthesia and hemiplegia
which lasted only a few seconds and were self resolved. A CT was
negative by report. He was started on Coumadin subsequently. In
February of 1994 , he had an echocardiogram which demonstrated a
left ventricular end diastolic diameter of 6.2 cm and ejection
fraction of 20%. There was no thrombus seen. There was 2+ mitral
regurgitation. There were no regional wall motion abnormalities.
He was doing fairly well at home with medical management without
any admissions for congestive heart failure until earlier this
year. He began to have worsening symptoms following a viral
illness in October of 1997. At that time an echocardiogram in
October of 1997 demonstrated a probably left ventricular thrombus
and ejection fraction of 12%. His Lasix dose was increased and his
Atenolol dose was decreased. He improved and in October of 1997 , he
was able to participate in activities such as sledding and skating
with only occasional chest pressure and dyspnea on exertion. In
October of 1997 , an exercise tolerance test was performed which he
went 11 minutes. Maximum heart rate was 148. His rate pressure
product was 18 , 000 and the peak oxygen consumption was 20.4. At
the time nitrates were added to his regimen. His Atenolol was
increased. However , nitrates were discontinued because of headache
and insomnia. Now , over the prior one to two months , proceeding
admission , he has had worsening symptoms with orthopnea , dyspnea on
minimal exertion with less than one flight of stairs , decreased
appetite. His weight is stable , but it is felt to be a decrease in
the body amount with an increase in fluid weight. He has nocturnal
shortness of breath and dyspnea. There is no syncope. He was seen
by Dr. Parker Willy and was felt to be at that time a class four
on the Thyna 1 , Cuse , Nebraska 41604 . His Lasix was increased and he
was referred for admission.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for orthopnea as well as paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea four out of seven nights.
There is no nocturia. His exercise tolerance is approximately one
flight of stairs with moderate shortness of breath. He complains
of nausea and anorexia without vomiting. He also has insomnia and
erectile difficulties. He has a 6 lb. weight loss over the week
prior to admission following an increase in outpatient diuretic
use. His baseline weight was 175 lbs. One month ago , it was 165
lbs. and the day of admission , it is 155 lbs.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for cardiomyopathy as above , gunshot
wound to his chest and head at the age of 14
and motor vehicle accident , Hepatitis B. He has had four
colonoscopies in the past and has had no polyps.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for appendectomy and a ganglion
cyst in his right wrist.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Enalapril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )
Atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. 5 )
Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day. 6 ) Kay Ciel 10 mg p.o. q. day. 7 )
Multivitamins one p.o. q. day.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a sales representative for a food broker.
He lives with his wife and three daughters in
Y He was a former smoker who quit in 1984. Previously , he
had smoked one to two packs per day for twelve years. He continues
to use alcohol and drinks approximately six beers per week.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father is 70 years old. His mother is 68. He
has a sister with colon polyps and a brother who
is healthy. His family history is otherwise notable for familial
colon cancer and polyposis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Weight 72 kg , afebrile , heart
rate 78 , blood pressure 95/71 , respiratory
rate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air. HEENT is
normocephalic , atraumatic. Oropharynx revealed multiple fillings ,
but there is no abnormality. His neck is supple with no
thyromegaly , carotid bruits or jugular venous distension. His
jugular venous pressure is 6 cm. His chest is clear. His cardiac
examination is regular rate and rhythm with an S3 as well as right
ventricular impulse palpable and audible. His abdomen was soft ,
non-tender with normal active bowel sounds. He had no bruits. His
liver is 12-14 cm and 1 cm below the right costal margin. There
are no masses. His extremities were warm and well perfused.
Neurological examination revealed a mild right facial asymmetry ,
but otherwise , his neurological examination is non-focal.
LABORATORY: Laboratory evaluation on admission was notable for a
sodium of 133 , creatinine 1.2. Liver function tests
are notable for a bilirubin of 1.7 and 0.7. His complete blood
count is unremarkable. His INR was 1.4. His urinalysis was
unremarkable. Pulmonary function tests on admission included an
FVC of 81% of predicted and FEV1 of 78% of predicted and an
FEV1/FVC ratio of 97% of predicted. His DLCO is 90% of predicted.
EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm at 80 with first degree
atrioventricular block. His PR interval is 0.226. His QRS
interval is 0.10 and his QTC is 0.401. There was a left anterior
hemi-block. His axis is -49 degrees. There was left atrial
enlargement. There was poor R-wave progression. There were
flipped T-waves across the precordium. There was an increase in
left atrial size since October of 1997 , otherwise no acute changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 42 year-old gentleman with idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy now presented with
worsening functional status over the past few months as well as
recent fluid overload necessitating increase in Lasix. There was a
question of patient non-compliance especially given his current
alcohol use which raises the question of psychologic readiness for
cardiac transplant at this time. Following admission , the patient
underwent a right heart catheterization which demonstrated right
atrial pressure of 7 , right ventricular pressure of 55/12 , PA
pressures of 58/32 , mean wedge pressure of 30 , arterial pressure at
the time was 113/74 with a mean of 90. Additionally , by Fick , his
cardiac output was 2.85 with a cardiac index of 1.49 , pulmonary
venous resistance of 280 and a systemic venous resistance of 2 , 330.
Because of this markedly high SVR and a borderline PVR , he was
started on intravenous nitrates with intravenous Nitroprusside with
a significant decrease in his SVR as well as his PA pressures.
This was felt to be a significant enough reduction in his pressures
to suggest that he would be a successful transplant candidate.
Therefore , he was transitioned to oral nitrates and started on
Isordil by mouth. However , he developed intolerance to nitrates
with severe headaches and ultimately all nitrates were
discontinued. He was subsequently managed only on afterload
reduction. His Analopril was held and he was started on Captopril
which was titrated up with good maintenance of his decrease in
pressure. Additionally , he was started on Losartan for further
afterload reduction which he tolerated well without orthostatic
symptoms. His Lasix was gradually increased and he continued to
have quite a significant improvement symptomatically with no
further orthopnea in the hospital. Further parts of the cardiac
transplant work-up were undertaken including PPD and controls which
were placed. There was no reaction to either PPDs or controls at
72 hours. He had a B12 and folate level drawn which were within
normal limits. His thyroid function test demonstrated a TSH of 1.9
and all other parameters were within normal limits. Digoxin level
on discharge was maintained in a therapeutic range. Hepatitis
panel was sent and he was negative for Hepatitis B antigen or
antibody as well as Hepatitis C antibodies. 24 hour urine
collection was obtained for creatinine and his creatinine clearance
was at 88 at 24 hours. Pulmonary function tests were as noted
above. He was seen by Dental Consult and was felt to have a few
minor restorative needs which could be taken care of by his
outpatient dentist , but he was dentally cleared otherwise for a
transplant. Subsequent to his medical changes and his transplant
work-up , he was restarted on his Coumadin and was discharged when
his INR had become greater than 2 with a target range of 2 to 2.5
planned. Echocardiogram was performed on October , 1997 which
demonstrated 1+ tricuspid regurgitation , 2+ mitral regurgitation ,
severely dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 20%.
There was diffuse severe hypokinesis and apical akinesis. There
was evidence of echo contrast within the left ventricle suggesting
a clot. There was moderate left atrial enlargement.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition. He was markedly improved from
a symptomatic point of view on discharge.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Royce Mcumber in
the Tho Medical Center

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a pleasant 78-year-old gentleman who presents with
shortness of breath and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for
approximately three weeks. He has a history of coronary artery
disease with an MI in 1994 and four-vessel CABG with subsequently
placed five stents in 2002 for graft and native vessel stenosis ,
hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline
creatinine of 2.8 , diabetes mellitus ( insulin dependent ) ,
hyperlipidemia , and a pace maker for symptomatic bradycardia. He
is presented with three weeks of increasing orthopnea , dyspnea ,
and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with rare chest tightness
without radiation and onset of symptoms mainly while recumbent.
He presents after coming to an outside hospital with three to
four days of these worsening symptoms. He was transferred to
Baspit Hospital where he received most of his
cardiac care. The patient had these worsening heart failure
symptoms after a trip to I Hwy , Ny Vale , Michigan 34152 , some dietary indiscretion and
a five-pound weight gain. He has had no syncope , palpitations ,
but has had some mild nausea without emesis. At the outside
hospital when he presented , his EKG showed a baseline left
bundle-branch block and had a troponin of 0.13. He was given
some Lasix and had echocardiogram , had initially revealed an
ejection fraction of 35%. He was transferred to Me Ale Firstray Hospital , started on a nitroglycerin drip as well as a
heparin drip for presumed coronary artery disease , a repeat
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 50% , anterior wall
distal dyskinesis from an old myocardial infarction and
moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. This is consistent with
an echocardiogram that he received in 1/8 . Upon
presentation , the patient was afebrile , had a heart rate of 82 ,
blood pressure of 138/64 and was sating 96% on 5 liters of nasal
canula. His jugular venous pressure was 7 cm. His lungs had
rales bilaterally , approximately half way up. He had no
dullness. His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6
holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the left
axilla. He had no S3 , and no S4. His abdomen was mildly
distended. He had no fluid waves and positive bowel sounds. His
extremities were warm. He had no pedal edema and 1+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally. EKG at Baneers Hospital
revealed a dual chamber pacemaker with left bundle-branch pattern
and no significant ST wave changes and an occasional PVC.
ADMISSION LABORATORIES:
Significant for a creatinine of 3.1 , a BUN of 76 , potassium of
5.3 , his hematocrit was 29.4 , and PT-T was 56 on heparin drip.
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Ischemia. The patient has an extensive history of coronary
artery disease. He is maintained on aspirin , Plavix , low dose
beta-blocker with carvedilol as well as ACE inhibitor and statin.
He initially came in with a troponin of 0.13 , which was felt as
demand ischemia related to systemic hypertension and pulmonary
hypertension. His enzymes trended down and were negative after
the initial check. Eventually , the patient received 48 hours of
intravenous heparin as well as IV nitroglycerin and was chest
pain free. At this point , he received an Adenosine MIBI nuclear
study , which revealed a known distal anterior wall scar with a
very small surrounding region of reversible ischemia that was
felt to be nonrevascularizable. He was maintained on optimum
medical management with the caveat that cardiac catheterization
in this gentleman who had already had previous history of renal
dysfunction with a creatinine rise to nearly 7 with a dye load
was not warranted nor indicated at this time. By discharge , he
was ambulating halls and was chest tightness free. Coronary
artery disease was felt to be a noncontributory factor to his CHF
exacerbation.
2. Pump. The patient had an ejection fraction of 45% upon
admission with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. He was
initially diuresed approximately 3 liters with a combination of
Lasix and Natrecor. At this point , his pulmonary edema had
resolved and his oxygen requirement was decreased. Given the
fact of his tenuous renal status , we wanted to avoid further
diuresis or after-load reduction until we knew exactly what his
right and left heart filling pressures were. The patient was
taken to the Cardiovascular Diagnostic Laboratory and received a
right heart catheterization. His pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was determined to be 16 and his pulmonary artery
pressure 56/18. His RA pressure was 8. There was some initial
false elevation because of inadequate sedation while in the cath
lab , and the patient was transferred for 48 hours of tailored
therapy to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a pulmonary artery
catheter in place. At this point , his after-load reduction was
maximized with combination of hydralazine and Isordil with good
effect. His creatinine decreased with after-load reduction to
2.7. His symptoms improved and we were able to diurese another 2
liters of the patient. By discharge , the patient was actually
becoming hypertensive again and he was started on amlodipine , a
calcium channel blocker , which he has tolerated in the past. Of
note , the patient has been exposed to ACE inhibition in the past
and is currently not on an ACE inhibitor. In the past , he had
had a rise in his potassium to 5.5 on ACE inhibition. On an
outpatient basis in the future , we would suggest the patient have
a trial of ACE or ARB to optimize his after-load reduction and
neurohormonal activation with his heart failure. The patient's
heart failure regimen includes standing Lasix , carvedilol ,
Isordil and hydralazine , as well as digoxin for symptomatic
improvement.
3. Rhythm. The patient has a dual-chambered pacemaker. He was
maintained on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. His
electrolytes were replete and he is on a low-dose beta-blocker.
He had a few rounds of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia less
than 8 beats every time during his hospital stay. The patient is
not at this time a candidate for resynchronization biventricular
pacer therapy because his ejection fraction of 45% , even if his
QRS interval is greater than 150 ms.
4. Pulmonary. Given the fact that the patient had a normal
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and elevated pulmonary artery
pressures , a brief investigation of pulmonary parenchymal disease
was undertaken. He had a high resolution chest CT , which showed
mild ground glass infiltrate at the bases consistent with
pulmonary edema and no evidence of interstitial process. He also
had pulmonary function tests. Pulmonary function tests revealed
an FVC of 1.88 liters and an FEV1 of 1.33 liters. This gives an
FEV1 to FVC percent of 71%. He has both decreased FVC and FEV1 ,
but an FEV1 and FVC percent that is most consistent with a mild
restriction. His lung volumes are approximately 50% predicted
suggestive of a restrictive process and his DLCO both corrected
and uncorrected are 50% predicted. His corrected DLCO is 13.5.
It is unclear if the patient has underlying restrictive lung
disease given the absence of definitive interstitial process on
high resolution chest CT. A more likely explanation for these
findings is a residual pulmonary edema relating to inadequate
diuresis with his congestive heart failure. The patient was
sating 98% on room air at the time of discharge.
5. Endocrine. The patient has very difficult to control
diabetes mellitus , and was maintained on both NPH and Lispro
sliding scale while in house. He was briefly hypoglycemic during
his initial hospital course because of a urinary tract infection.
This resolved after approximately 24 hours of holding his
long-acting insulin and giving him glucose replacement therapy.
He was euglycemic on 15 and 10 of NPH in the a.m. and p.m.
respectively as well as a Lispro scale at the time of discharge.
Furthermore , the patient was found to have a TSH of 0.219 as well
as a normal T4 , this is suggestive of clinical hypothyroidism ,
which is consistent with over replacement with Synthroid such as
maintenance Synthroid dose is decreased from 75 mcg to 60.5 mcg
and we recommend a TSH to be checked in late February 2004.
6. Renal. The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency
presumably due to a combination of diabetes and hypertension. He
has had adverse reaction to contrast dye in the past with a
creatinine bump to nearly 7. We wanted to avoid as much contrast
dye as possible during this hospital stay because of his renal
insufficiency. We ended up re-dosing his digoxin to three times
weekly from every other day because of the dig level of 0.19.
His creatinine was 2.7 and falling at the time of discharge and
his BUN was 67. He was making good urine and had no evidence of
residual urinary tract infection.
7. Infectious disease. Upon presentation , the patient after a
Foley was placed became a little delirious and hypoglycemic.
Urine cultures grew out greater than 100 , 000 colonies of Serratia
marcescens and he was given a 14-day course of renally dosed
levofloxacin with good resolution of his symptoms.
8. Neuropsych. The patient has a history of depression and had
some mild delirium in the setting of urinary tract infection ,
which resolved with p.r.n. Zyprexa as well as treating of the
underlying condition. Psychiatric Service was consulted and felt
like he had a resolving medical delirium and there is no
indication for further pharmacal or psychodynamic therapy at this
time. ( His mild subclinical hyperthyroidism may have contributed
to his low mood as apathetic hyperthyroidism in a gentleman of
this age is not uncommon. )
9. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on Nexium for GI
prophylaxis and subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

The patient is full code.
The patient was consulted by both Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy who felt that acute rehabilitation would be
warranted at this time.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: leg swelling
-----
HPI: 71 yo male with h/o DM , HTN , and poss CHF
( pt denies and unclear from documenation ) here with 2 weeks of LE
edema. Of note pt was difficult to obtain a history from and there
is little consistency between his story on admission and what
was recorded by his PCP in his S chart. Pt states he has had
increasing LE swelling for 2 weeks despite taking all of his
medications. Pt states that he has not increased his Na intake
recently. Pt repeatedly denied SOB , increased abd girth , and PND.
Pt did note that he sleeps on 2 pillows at night but his breathing
his fine when he is lying flat.
Next day spoke with patient's wife who confirmed story documented by PCP
including increasing shorntness of breath and orthopnea.
ED: lasix 120 IV x 1 ROS: no fevers , chills , or night sweats. No
ST , hearing problems , or visual problems. No SOB , but
does note non-productive cough x 1 day. No CP , palpitations ,
orthopnea , or PND. No abd pain , N/V , diarrhea , BRBPR. Pt does
endorse nocturia stating that he gets up 6-7 times/night to urinate.
No dysuria or hematuria. No joint pains or rashes.

CONSULTS: Pulmonary Medicine ( Dr. Kohlmeyer )
-----
IMP: 71 yo male with h/o DM , HTN , and poss h/o CHF who presents with
2 weeks of LE edema.
-----
PLAN:
CARDS:
I: No known h/o CAD-little concern for ACS with no sxs except LE
edema -unclear why not on ASA , no h/o GI bleed or ulcer. Will start ASA
for primary/secondary prevention. Checked lipid profile , trigs very
elevated at 482 and HDL 24. LDL could not be peformed b/c trigs were so
high. Started gemfibrozil , pt can have repeat lipid profile as outpt and
statin at discretion of PCP. Pt was continued on BB but dose was
decreased to 50mg po daily as pt having asymptomatic bradycardia to 40's
while sleeping.
P: Pt's OS notes list CHF as dx , pt denies any h/o LE edema or CHF
before 2 weeks ago but is on lasix bid at home. Last echo in 4/3
showed LVH w/ preserved EF. Pt with likely diastolic dysfunction. Pt on
exam has only LE edema , but received 120 IV lasix in ED. Pt's
presentation c/w CHF exacerbation but BNP of 13 is unusual. Continued
to diurese pt with IV lasix and once he was approaching euvolemia
switched him back over to home dose. Pt's LE edema likely multifactorial
due to CHF and some component of chronic venous stasis. LENIs were
checked and were negative for DVTS. Discontinued pt's CCB as may be
contributing to LE edema. Echo was repeated this admit which
showed EF 60-65% and signs of diastolic dysfunction.
HTN: BP was controlled this admit. Pt was continued on BB , norvasc , &
catapres
R: no issues this admit
ENDO: Pt has h/o DM and pt states he is taking insulin at home ( unclear
dose ). Pt was started on Lantus with SS novolog and his sugars were
somewhat elevated. Advised pt to restart home insulin regimen after d/c.
Sent HgA1C but was still pending at the time of discharge.
RENAL: pt appears to have CKD per SHC recs -baseline 1.4-1.6 , renally
dose meds
NEURO: Pt's wife noted that pt has intermittently been confused at home.
She describes episodes when he wakes up at night and doesn't know where
he is. This is likely due to hypoxia as pt has severe sleep apnea and
rarely wears cpap at home. Pt was alert and oriented during this admit.
Sent labs to evaluate for secondary cause of dementia and they were
negative. Suggested that pt f/u with PCP if these episodes persist.
PULM: Pt with h/o sleep apnea. Per 2003 sleep study pt's sleep apnea
was central and not obstructive although this is difficult to believe
based on pt's body habitus and redundant neck tissue. Pt evaluated by
pulmonary after RA ABG showed PaO2 50's. Pt pulse ox was monitored and
when he fell asleep without his cpap he desatted to low 60's and high
50's. Pt satted in mid 90's on RA while awake and upright. Pulmonary
thought pt likely with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea
( central +/- obstructive ). Pt tried on empiric bipap ( 4/9 ) the night
prior to d/c and felt that he slept much better. Of note pt used the
nasal mask in house but has the full mask at home. Tried to set up pt
for home bipap but is not eligible unless has another sleep study.
Communicated this with pt's PCP who will set up repeat sleep study in
near future. Pt also started on empiric qhs acetazolamide per pulmonary
recs based on recent data showing that it improves symptoms in pt's with
central sleep apnea and heart failure.

*************************Hospital Course********************
1.CV ISCH: Elevated ck , tni ( - ) , ckmb low , ruled out X3 cont.
Beta Blocker , ASA , non-occlusive 2vd on cath.
PUMP: warm and wet; the patient was diresed approximately 6 Liters to
her dry weight of 149 kilograms. At dry weight patient had a BNP
of 3700. In house her ACE was switched to Cozaar secondary to cough.
Beta Blocker was changed to once a day Atenolol. An echo on 8/28
revealed EF 21% mV moderate mr , incomplete closure , TV: moderate tr ,
incomplete closure;LV globak HK , rv mildly to moderately decreased ,
incomplete study due to patient not fully cooperating. On the patients
final day in the hospital she was noted to have symptomatic dehydra
tion and was orthostatic - symptoms resoved with a 500 cc NS bolus.
2.ENDO : the patient's insulin regiment was modified and she was dc'd
on insulin 70/30 10 am. THe patient's admission regimine of Lantus 40 q
d was causing both hyper and hypoglycemia in house. Her hospital course
was notable for a few episodes of hypoglycemia resulting in down
titration of insulin AM and PM doses. THe patient was noted to be
extremely hypoglycmeic on 8 units of 70/30 in the PM and the PM
insulin was discontinued for the time being. It was decided that the
patient's diet at home would have higher glucose and carbohydrate
content and her Fs's will need further w/up as outpatient. We reccomend
titrating the 70/30 insulin up as needed.
3.GI: she complained of mild epigastric pain after meals , and said it
is thought that this represents diabetic gastroparesis. Her reglan
dose was increased to 10 and she tolerated PO's better subsequently and
was less symptomatic.
4.HEME: cont coumadin
5.PROPHYLAXIS: coumadin , nexium

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Please followup with Dr. Scarles in 1-2 weeks
2. Please switch your insulin to 10 units of 70/30 insulin the morning.
Your primary doctor may make changes in your insulin regimin
based on your recorded blood sugars.
3. Please stop taking Metoprolol and Lisinopril.
4. Please start taking Cozaar and Atenolol. Your Reglan dose is
increased.
5. VNA for diabetes management , CHF management , and medical compliance.

showed no evidence of a DVT and on 7/18 she had a CT with PE protocol which
showed no evidence of a DVT or PE. She was given mucomyst for this for
renal protection. She was continued on her CPAP for OSA.
2. HTN: The patient was continued on her avapro and Imdur. Her diltiazem
and atenolol doses were decreased as she was having bradycardia with rates
in the 40s on the first day of her hospital stay.
3. CAD: The patient was continued on her imdur , beta blocker , and aspirin.
Her plavix was held as she was holding this as an outpatient for upcoming
cataract surgery. Her last stent was 2001 and she was given permission by
her outpatient cardiologist to hold this.
4. DM: Her avandia and metformin were held and she was continued on her
NPH and a sliding scale.
5. RENAL: Her Cr. was 1.4 at admission and improved to 1.1 with diuresis.
She was given mucomyst for renal protection.
6. FEN: She was maintained on a 2L fluid restriction and 2g Na
restriction.

ATTENDING: OBEY , LAWRENCE MD
SERVICE: Obstetrics/Maternal Fetal Medicine.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pre-gestational diabetes.
2. History of coronary artery disease.
3. Recurrent SABs
4. Hepatitis B.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old G16 ,
P0-0-15-0 , who presented at 6 and 4/7 weeks by LMP
consistent with ultrasound of the day of admission , as a transfer
from the High-Risk Obstetric Clinic , admitted to the Fuller
Antepartum Service for diabetic control. The patient had
presented to the Special OB Clinic as a new patient for prenatal
care. Review of her medical problems revealed that the recent
glucose control had been suboptimal. In view of this and in view
of the fact that the patient had multiple other issues , the
patient was admitted for diabetic control , adjustment of her
insulin regimen and evaluation regarding the other medical
problems.
History of present pregnancy: the patient had a last
menstrual period in the second week of October . Ultrasound on the
day of admission , 9/5/07 , revealed a 6.6-week intrauterine
pregnancy with a fetal heart rate of 110. The estimated date of
confinement is 4/19/07. Prenatal screening labs were pending at
the time of admission. The patient has blood group O +ve.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of ST elevation
myocardial infarction in 2000. The infarct was a presumed
embolism to the left anterior descending and the left circumflex coronary
artery. The complete occlusion of the mid-to-distal left
anterior descending artery , which was thought to be due to
thrombosis , was treated with TPA and angioplasty. The patient had
a normal catheterization in October 2000. The last echocardiogram
revealed an ejection fraction of 45% in 2002; however , the
patient never had a repeat echo since that time. On the day of
admission , the patient reported that she was able to climb four
flights of stairs to her apartment , haveing to pause after two flights of
stairs to catch her breath.
In addition , the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus , diagnosed in 2000.
The patient had a medical admission in 2006 for hypoglycemia when she
incidentally injected Humalog instead of Lantus. On the day of admission , the
patient was on a Humalog 7 units b.i.d. and Lantus 12 units in
the evening. Her fasting sugars were in the 150s before admission and her
blood sugar measurements were over 200 in the evening. On the day of
admission , the fasting sugar was 123.
In addition , the patient has a history of hepatitis B ,
diagnosed in 2005. The patient had a positive E antigen in 2005.
She had previously been on Epivir 150 mg p.o. daily , but this
was stopped prior to the current pregnancy.
PAST OB/GYN HISTORY: The patient has a history of a fibroid
uterus , and a history of recurrent miscarriages. In terms of the
fibroid uterus , the patient did report pelvic pain in the
outpatient setting. Ultrasound had shown an 8-10 cm
dominant posterior fibroid. The patient occasionally takes
oxycodone for fibroid pain.
In terms of the patient's recurrent miscarriages , the patient had fifteen SABs
in the past with over 10 dilatation and evacuations , including one molar
pregnancy with subsequent choriocarcinoma. All losses were in the first
trimester , less than 12 weeks' gestation. The patient had been
evaluated previously for a thrombophilia workup , but this had
been negative multiple times aside from a MTHFR gene mutation ,
which was noted on this admission , and it is unclear whether this
has been addressed previously. The patient had previously been
told by a reproductive endocrinologist , that she should consider
adoption or a gestational carrier. Chromosomes on several
pathology specimens from the previous abortions showed
aneuploidy.
The patient currently denies a history of sexually
transmitted infections. She has a history of cervical dysplasia ,
with a history of CIN I and CIN II in 1990 and 1992. She
underwent a LEEP in 1992 , which was consistent with HSIL. All
subsequent Pap smears were either within normal limits. Last Pap
smear done in February 2006 at Rexmo Sha Hospital Of was insufficient for
analysis. In terms of the patient's history of choriocarcinoma , the patient
had a molar pregnancy , which then developed into a subsequent choriocarcinoma.
For this , the patient was treated with methotrexate , actinomycin D and Cytoxan ,
then VP-16 , cisplatin and bleomycin with presumed cure.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Dilatation and evacuation x10 ,
hysteroscopy for infertility workup , and LEEP.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Humalog Insulin 7 units twice a day ,
Lantus 12 units in the evening , aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily stopped
prior to pregnancy , history of lamivudine/Epivir use , 150 daily
stopped prior to current pregnancy.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Former smoker , given up smoking in 2000 after a
myocardial infarct. No history of alcohol abuse or IV drug use.
The patient lives in Doreska Dr , Nah Min Knox with her boyfriend , unemployed.
FAMILY HISTORY: No history of GYN malignancies , history of
maternal diabetes , longstanding. Father with coronary artery
disease in his 50s.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for the primary
purpose of diabetic control.
1. Diabetes mellitus. The patient had reported poor diabetic
control as an outpatient. Therefore , her regimen was continued ,
with the addition of a sliding scale , in order to determine the
additional insulin needs as an outpatient. Over the course of
the admission , the patient's Lantus was increased to 20 units at
nighttime , and she was using 8 units three times a day of insulin
lispro , in addition to a lispro sliding scale. With this
regimen , the fingerstick glucose control improved , and the
fasting blood sugar on the day of discharge was 90. On the day
prior to discharge , the patient had blood sugars in the range
from 93 to 139. An HbA1c was sent , which was 6.7 , during this
admission , the patient also had a Nutrition consult. She will be
followed in the High-Risk Obstetric and Diabetic Clinic by Dr.
Borguez
2. Cardiology. The patient was restarted on her aspirin , given
her history of myocardial infarct at a very early age. In
addition , an echocardiogram was obtained on the day after
admission. This revealed an ejection fraction of 50% as well as
a large left ventricular thrombosis , which was presumed to be a
longstanding. Cardiology was consulted and the impression was
that the thrombosis was likely a combination of her left
ventricular hypokinesia related to the previous infarct , as well
as her hypercoagulable state. Therefore , their recommendation
was to start the patient on Lovenox for the duration of this
pregnancy , which adjusted for her weight was a dose of 90 mg
daily , followed by a transition to Coumadin postpartum , to be
continued for likely long-term , possibly lifelong duration. The
Cardiology Consult Team noted that the MTHFR mutation had not
resulted in elevated homocysteine levels in the past. However ,
they did agree that folate supplementation at high doses was
indicated. The patient will be continued on Lovenox 90 mg daily
subcutaneously , and aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily as an outpatient.
She will have Cardiology followup with Dr. Jasper Erps on
3/6/07. During the entire admission , she was hemodynamically
stable , in sinus rhythm , with no complaints of chest pain ,
shortness of breath or palpitations.
3. Hepatitis B. The patient had liver function tests and a
hepatitis panel on this admission , given her history of active
disease diagnosed in 2005 , with a positive hepatitis E antigen.
On admission , the patient had not been on Epivir , which had been
stopped prior to this current pregnancy. Liver function tests
were checked on this admission and were within normal limits. In
addition , serologies were checked and the hepatitis E antigen and
the E antibody was negative. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B
core antigen were reactive. At the time of this dictation , a
hepatitis B viral load was pending. Given the patient's history
of hepatitis B , an outpatient appointment was being arranged at
the time of discharge , with Dr. Lavy , from the Division of
Gastroenterology at the Sasspan Hospital . It was
decided that the patient should not take any lamivudine until
Gastroenterology followup. During the entire hospital stay , the
patient did not have any GI complaints , was tolerating a regular
diet , and having normal regular bowel movements.
4. history of fibroids , the patient was noted again to have an 8-cm fibroid
on her ultrasound scan. She required rare intermittent doses of
oxycodone as required for pain , which was presumed to be related
to her fibroid uterus.
5. Prenatal care. The patient had her first trimester labs sent
on this admission. GC and chlamydia testing were negative.
Urine culture was negative. The patient was O +ve. Given the
patient's history of MTHFR mutation and the recurrent SABs , the
patient was started on prenatal vitamins , as well as high-dose
folic acid , B12 and B6. In view of the patient's diabetic
history , and a transiently elevated creatinine to 1.2 on hospital
day 2 , which went back to 0.7 on the day of discharge , the
patient had a 24-hour urine collection sent , this returned
negative at 92 mg per 24 hours. It was noted that the patient
had an Ophthalmology retinal exam at an outside hospital health
center this year. For the remainder of this pregnancy , it was
noted that the patient will require ultrasounds at 11 and 17
weeks , as well as a fetal echo , and the recommended testing for
pre-gestational diabetics for the remainder of the pregnancy.
The patient was discharged in a stable condition , with followup
appointments arranged for the various specialties.

PROBLEMS: 1. SYNCOPE.
2. ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION.
3. ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
5. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old white male with
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy who was
admitted with syncope. He is status post myocardial infarction in
1979 and 1985 as well as a coronary artery bypass graft in 1987
with a LIMA to LAD , SVG to RCA , SVG to OMB. Over the past ten
years he has complained of increasing CHF symptoms including
dyspnea on exertion , fatigue , chest tightness and has had multiple
admits for exacerbations , the most recent from November to
March , 2001 for progressive fatigue. At that time a right
heart catheterization revealed high filling pressures and he was
treated with aggressive diuresis. Angiography revealed occluded
SVGs and a patent LIMA. Dobutamine radionuclide study revealed
inferior and inferolateral infarct. There was no evidence of
revascularization. Evaluation for heart transplant found cirrhosis
by liver spleen scan which ruled out the possibility of transplant.
He reported light-headedness and dizziness and was seen by the
Electrophysiology Service who performed an EP study which was
negative for provokable VT and since he is not a transplant
candidate it was felt that empiric ICD placement would not be in
his best interest. His light-headedness and presyncope worsened.
His captopril dose was reduced from 37.5 mg to 25 mg t.i.d. with
marked improvement in his energy and less dizziness. Over the past
weeks his dizziness and light-headedness recurred and worsened with
episodes of presyncope and frank syncope. On the day of admission
he was scheduled for a clinic appointment. On arrival he felt
dizzy and ""crumpled"" with loss of consciousness and therefore was
admitted for further evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection
fraction of 15% to 20% in February of 2001 ,
status post anterior MI in 1980 and 1986 , three vessel CABG in 1987
with LIMA to LAD , SVG to OM and SVG to PDA , type 2 diabetes
mellitus , insulin dependent , hypothyroidism , nephrolithiasis ,
gallstones , cardiac cirrhosis which is mild and was diagnosed in
February 2001 by abdominal ultrasound and liver scan , IBS , psoriasis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH
insulin 65 units subcu b.i.d. , Xanax p.r.n. , torsemide 120 mg p.o.
q.a.m. , torsemide 80 mg p.o. q.p.m. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Synthroid 250 mcg p.o. q.d. , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Lying blood pressure
94/58 , heart rate 70 , oxygen
saturation 97% on room air. Sitting blood pressure 78/54. Patient
could not stand secondary to light-headedness to complete
orthostatic vital signs. Afebrile. General: Appearing
comfortable in a supine position. No acute distress.
Cardiovascular: Regular. Normal S1 , S2. No S3. JVP
approximately 5 cm. A II/VI holosystolic murmur at apex. Lungs:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft , non-tender ,
nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: No edema.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 128 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 91 ,
bicarbonate 22 , BUN 64 , creatinine 2.6 ,
glucose 348. White blood cell count 17.9 , hematocrit 37.6 ,
platelets 286.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: None.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 62-year-old white male with history of
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary
artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy and probably cardiac
cirrhosis who presents with presyncope and syncope. The arrhythmia
was considered possible and there has been none documented and he
was not inducible two years prior to admission. Given his
orthostatic vital signs it was felt that his volume status and
medications were responsible for his symptoms. In addition his
elevated BUN and creatinine were consistent with volume depletion.
He improved off diuretics , nitrates and ACE inhibitor as well as
liberalization of his diet regarding salt and fluid intake. There
were no arrhythmias noted on his telemetry monitor. An endocrine
consult was called to evaluate for possible contribution of
autonomic insufficiency secondary to his diabetes mellitus. They
recommended decreasing his Synthroid dose due to a suppressed TSH
as well as more aggressive blood sugar control , however , they were
unable to document orthostatic hypotension and felt that his
episodes of presyncope and syncope were related to his volume
status and medications rather than autonomic insufficiency.

ATTENDING: SWEED , ZANE MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MRSA-infected abdominal mesh.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 90+-year-old male with a
complex past medical history including CAD status post stent x2 ,
hypertension , CHF with an EF of 10-20% , AF , on chronic
anticoagulation , status post pacer placement , and diabetes
mellitus who presented to the SICU status post exploratory
laparotomy for removal of chronically MRSA-infected mesh from
prior abdominal surgery. He was admitted to the ICU for
careful monitoring and fluid volume management
postoperatively. He has had multiple abdominal surgeries. The
mesh was originally placed for ventral hernia repair in 2005. He
had since developed draining sinus tracts for which cultures have
grown out MRSA. He was admitted preoperatively for reversal of
anticoagulation and semi-urgent removal of the mesh. In the
operating room , he underwent an exploratory laparotomy , lysis of
adhesions and removal of the abdominal mesh. He was closed and
one Jackson-Pratt drain was left in place. During the procedure ,
he was intubated with etomidate , succinylcholine and kept sedated
with Versed and fentanyl. He received intraoperative vancomycin
and levofloxacin as well as 2200 mL of lactated Ringer's. In an
attempt to reverse anticoagulation , one unit of FFP was begun but
then aborted due to hypotension , which resolved with epinephrine
injection , likely due to transfusion reaction. Another unit of
FFP was hung and tolerated well. EBL was 300 mL. Urine output
was 410 mL for the four-hour case. He was extubated uneventfully
and transferred to the ICU in stable condition.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Colon cancer , status post colonoscopy in 2005 that was
negative.
2. Prostate cancer.
3. History of CVA with a left occipital infarct thought to be

remarkable for bleeding with sanguinous output from the JP drain ,
a question of an abdominal hematoma and a progressive drop in his
hematocrit. The heparin drip , which was initiated given the
patient's chronic AF , was discontinued and FFP administered.
Platelets were also given at the request of the Plastic Surgery
Team in light of aspirin and Plavix , which were continued due to
the patient's cardiac stents. Despite bolus Lasix , the patient
did develop CHF with symptomatic pulmonary edema and increased
oxygen requirement. Concomitantly , the patient also became
delirious , as is his historical pattern with significant agitation.
He developed hypertension refractory to beta-blockade , calcium
channel blockers and IV ACE inhibitors in this setting. The
patient was thus placed on a nitroglycerin drip , a furosemide
drip with ginger blood product resuscitation to address bleeding
and an elevated INR. He responded well to this regimen and
aggressive pulmonary toilet. Both the patient's PCP , Dr.
Gillice , and his cardiologist , Dr. Keks , did follow the
patient. His oxygenation never suffered during this time and he
did not have significant hypercarbia. He was eventually weaned
back to nasal cannula. He did have a mild transient elevation in
creatinine while on the Lasix drip but has since recovered back
to baseline off of the Lasix drip. His nasogastric tube was
removed on 5/18/06 and he tolerated ice chips without
difficulty. His home cardiac medications were restarted on
6/10/06. The patient was out of bed and ambulating without
difficulty. At the time of dictation , his nitroglycerin drip was
being weaned with the assistance of nitro paste. He is
anticipated to be transferred to the floor once he receives a red
blood cell transfusion and once the nitroglycerin drip is off.
PLAN:
Neuro:
1. The patient does sundown at home and has done so while in
the ICU. He has been much more calm and appropriate over the
past 24 to 36 hours.
2. He does experience more significant delirium with morphine
and less so with sparing Dilaudid p.r.n.
3. We will continue with sparing Dilaudid p.r.n. , and Zyprexa
2.5 at bedtime p.r.n. per home regimen. Haldol is written p.r.n.
as needed.
Cardiovascular:
1. CAD status post stent x2 , AF on chronic anticoagulation , CHF ,
status post pacer for sick sinus syndrome , currently V paced.

Discharge Date: 2/1/2001
CHIEF COMPLAINT: LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY NUMBNESS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Milo Barta is a 78-year-old
African American female with a
significant cardiac history , including hypertension , congestive
heart failure , history of afib -- patient is on Coumadin , CAD ,
status post MI , mitral valve replacement in 1995 or so , who was in
her usual state of health until the morning of admission , when she
says she awoke in a sweat , had a headache , and noticed she could
not stand. She felt that her left lower extremity was ""asleep"" and
weak. She called 911 , came to PCH . The patient also noted that
her speech seemed slurred at the time that she was unable to get
up. She denied any weakness or numbness in her other extremities
or face. She denied any chest pain , shortness of breath , or visual
changes. She says she did note transient heart palpitations. She
denied fever , chills , nausea , and vomiting. In the ER the patient
was noted to have 2/5 left lower extremity power. She had no
apparent sensory deficits at that time.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above , and including noninsulin dependent
diabetes mellitus , a status post left hip
replacement , history of DVT , status post mitral valve replacement
for mitral stenosis approximately eight years ago ( patient says she
has a history of rheumatic fever ) , and bilateral cataracts.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Norvasc 10 mg q. day , amiodarone 200 mg
q. day , Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 40
mg q. day , Coumadin 5 mg Monday , Wednesday , and Friday and 2.5 mg
Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday , and Sunday , Lomotil 1-2 mg q.i.d.
p.r.n. , glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. , and Prinivil 20 mg q. day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient denied any history of tobacco , ethanol , or
illicit drug use. She lives alone and says she is
a very private person. She does all of her own activities of daily
living and walks with a cane.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's mother died of an MI and her father
apparently died of a PE. She has a son that died
of an MI as well.
ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to penicillin , sulfa drugs ,
and aspirin.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On being admitted to the hospital , the
patient was afebrile at 97.4 degrees
Fahrenheit , with a pulse of 68 , blood pressure of 190/90 , and
satting 98% on room air. Patient's exam showed that she had no
carotid bruits or JVD. Her heart exam was notable for a regular
rate and rhythm , as well as prosthetic S1. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally and abdominal exam was benign.
Extremities showed cool fingers on the right , with a 1+ pulse , and
warm well perfused fingers on the left , with a 2+ radial pulse.
Apparently , these extremity changes are long-standing and not new.
She had 2+ pulses in her posterior tibial pulses and trace pulses
in her dorsalis pedes pulses bilaterally. On neuro exam the
patient was alert and oriented x three. She exhibited good naming ,
comprehension , reading , and fluency. Cranial nerves II-XII were
intact bilaterally. On motor exam the patient had 5/5 power
everywhere except for the left lower extremity , with knee flexors ,
knee extensors , ankle flexors , and ankle extensors being 3+/5 and
hip flexors and hip extensors being 4-/5. Her tone was slightly
increased in her left lower extremity. On sensory exam she had
slightly reduced sensation to pinprick , light touch , and
temperature in both extremities to the hip. Deep tendon reflexes
were symmetric and 2+ throughout , with downgoing toes bilaterally.
Pertinent labs on admission showed a slightly increased creatinine
at 1.7 and a BUN of 31. The patient had a TSH of 1.09 and a total
cholesterol of 197 , with an LDL of 131. Her sed. rate was 14 and
her hematocrit was 40.2. INR was noted to be 1.7. CKs were flat
and the patient was ruled out for an MI.
IMPRESSION:
1. Neurologic: Given the patient's significant cardiac history
and subtherapeutic INR , it was considered that her left lower
extremity weakness that was transient was likely a transient
ischemic attack. The patient's motor deficits quickly improved
over her hospital stay and she felt she was back to baseline on the
day of discharge. Head CT and head MRI and MRA were negative for
any acute changes , including hemorrhage and infarction. On MRA the
patient was noted to have some proximal stenosis of her right
intracranial carotid and had also some atherosclerotic changes of
her PCAs bilaterally. The patient also had ATTE with a bubble
study that was negative for PFO. The patient was continued on her
Coumadin at 5 mg q.h.s. until her INR was therapeutic. During this
interval she was started on heparin and was therapeutic on that.
The patient is to follow up in the Coumadin clinic as well as
neurology clinic in one month. She is to have her Coumadin drawn
at three days after discharge to ensure that her INR is above 2.
Her Coumadin dosing regimen was slightly changed , with her taking
four doses of 5 mg a week and three doses of 2.5 mg a week. The
patient was seen by physical therapy , who cleared her to go home
and felt that she was okay to walk stairs with her walker.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient has an extensive cardiac history
as detailed above. Her systolic blood pressure was calculated
between 120 and 160 during the first day of her hospital stay , as
it was unclear whether she had a serious carotid stenosis or not.
Her blood pressure meds were gradually added back. The patient had
several episodes of atypical chest pain , for which she was ruled
out with telemetry and enzymes , which were flat.
3. Endocrine: The patient was placed on a diabetic diet and was
continued on her glyburide. A hemoglobin A1C is pending at the
time of this dictation. She was covered with sliding scale insulin
during her hospital stay.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Amiodarone 200 mg q. day , Norvasc 10 mg
q. day , Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 40
mg q. day , Coumadin 5 mg Monday , Wednesday , Friday , and Sunday , and
2.5 mg Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday , glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. ,
Lasix 40 mg q. day , and Prinivil 20 mg q. day.

SERVICE: Coronary Care Unit.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Kolppa was a 58-year-old
woman with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and ejection
fraction of 15% who was initially admitted to the Faharb Medical Center Of following a cardiac arrest. On arrival in the
emergency department she was found to have recurrent ventricular
tachycardia and was defibrillated. She required an intraaortic
balloon pump to maintain her blood pressure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy. She has a pacemaker/ICD. She has a history of
chronic kidney disease , deep venous thrombosis , history of
cerebrovascular accident , history of hypercholesterolemia ,
history of coronary artery disease , history of diabetes , history
of GI bleed and history of chronic hepatitis C.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: Ms. Rubins had a complicated
course in the hospital and her care was related primarily to
recurrent ventricular tachycardia and prolonged anoxic injury
affecting multiple organ systems. During her hospital course ,
she required pressor medications , an intraaortic balloon pump ,
and ventilator support. Of note , the patient had noted , prior to her
admission , that she would never want to be dependent upon ""machines."" Due to
poor neurological status and poor
prognosis , and in conjunction with the patient's previously expressed wishes ,
medical care was withdrawn on 4/25 after many discussions with family. The
patient's primary care physician , Dr Sangh , was involved with these
discussions. The intraaortic balloon pump was turned off. Pressure medications
were held and the mechanical ventilator was stopped. The patient passed away
on 11/17/07 shortly after removal of mechanical support.

Discharge Date: 9/30/2001
PROCEDURE: Left lower extremity revascularization.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63 year old male with a
history of peripheral vascular disease
status post a left femoral to peroneal bypass graft on 4/19/01 for
left lower extremity rest pain. He presents with eleven days of
left lower extremity swelling. Over the prior eight days the
patient noticed pain and pinkish discoloration of the left foot.
The patient also noticed occasional left foot coldness which was
relieved with dependent positioning.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Peripheral vascular disease. Hypertension.
Diabetes mellitus. Aortic stenosis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left femoral to peroneal bypass in July of
2001. Right femoral to peroneal bypass in
September of 1999. Right fifth toe amputation in September of 1999. Multiple
wrist surgeries , including a failed left wrist fusion.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: He is on outpatient medications of Lopressor 25 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Glipizide 10 mg q.a.m. and 5 mg q.p.m. , Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. qhs ,
Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , and p.r.n. Percocet.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 10/21/01 for presumed
failed left femoral to peroneal bypass graft.
The patient was preopped for revision of his bypass graft and , on
1/26/01 , the patient was taken to the operating room for a femoral
to posterior tibial bypass graft. The patient tolerated the
procedure well but immediately postoperatively the patient was
noted to have non-Dopplerable signals in his left foot. The
patient was brought back to the operating room at which time the
significant sized clot was found in the distal anastomosis of the
graft which was removed. Again , the patient was returned to the
recovery room and , in the ensuing hours , the patient again lost all
Dopplerable signals in his left foot. On postoperative day #1 the
patient returned one more time to the operating room for revision
of his left bypass graft. The patient tolerated the procedure well
and had strong Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior
tibial pulse throughout the remainder of his hospital stay. The
patient was kept on perioperative Ancef antibiotics.
On postoperative day #0 the patient was found to be in respiratory
distress. Chest x-ray revealed flash pulmonary edema. Cardiology
consult was obtained at that time and an echocardiogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 35 percent with moderate aortic stenosis and
regurgitation. The patient ruled in by enzymes for a myocardial
infarction. The patient was kept on beta blocker for goal heart
rate less than 75 and was started on Digoxin. Cardiology also
recommended the addition of an Ace inhibitor for further blood
pressure control. The patient remained stable. He remained in the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit for the first three days
postoperatively at which time the patient was medically stable and
transferred to a surgical floor and monitored bed. Repeat
echocardiogram on postoperative day #4 and #3 was unchanged from
his prior echocardiogram , again , revealing an ejection fraction of
35 percent with global hypokinesis , severe aortic stenosis , and
moderate aortic regurgitation. Cardiology continued to follow the
patient throughout his hospital stay. They recommended the patient
return for cardiac catheterization following a short stay in acute
rehabilitation. Otherwise the patient progressed well. He did
develop a small amount of erythema in his left lower extremity
incision site. He was restarted on antibiotics and the erythema
slowly regressed over the ensuing three days. Otherwise the
patient's incisions to his right arm , left leg , and right leg all
were clean , dry , and intact with staples.
Physical therapy consult was obtained and the patient was able to
ambulate with the assistance of a walker. The patient continued to
progress well. He tolerated a regular diet and ambulated and
voided without difficulty. On postoperative days #9 and #8 , the
patient was accepted to acute rehabilitation at which time he was
transferred. The patient is in stable condition.
DISPOSITION: LEVEL OF ACTIVITY: He should continue working with
physical therapy to increase his mobility. DIET: He
has no restrictons of diet. Please keep his left lower extremity
elevated when he is resting in bed or in chair. Please call
Abed General Hospital if he experiences fevers , chills , or
redness or discharge from the surgical site. FOLLOWUP: The
patient is to follow-up with Dr. Koss in the vascular clinic.
Please call Cing Medical Center vascular clinic to arrange
for an appointment. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: He is discharged on
enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Captopril 25 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. , Glipizide 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. and

Discharge Date: 9/1/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57-year-old status
post a massive gastrointestinal bleed
in April of 2001 who was transferred to the Gosroa Health Services
Hospital for a TIPS procedure which failed. She proceeded to go to
surgery at that time for a splenorenal shunt. She was recently
discharged from the Tonla Liha Measemillr Hospital And Clinic on August ,
2002. During the hospitalization , she had a complicating course
with encephalopathy , but she was able to be controlled with
lactulose and discharged to rehabilitation. She at that time also
had complications with infections for which she completed a course
of antibiotics. At rehabilitation , she was doing fairly well , but
her ammonia had been high. The highest was 196 on March ,
2002. The patient has also had increased confusion , increased
abdominal girth. When the daughters went in to visit her today ,
she was completely disoriented , complaining of abdominal pain. The
daughters also report subjective fevers and chills. At the
rehabilitation , her vital signs were notable for a blood pressure
of 94/60 , temperature 99.2. Per the daughters , the diet had not
been followed at rehabilitation and she was eating hot dogs. She
was also given benzodiazepines for sleep , up to 60-75 mg q. day of
Oxazepam. Per report , she had increased confusion and more acutely
in the last two days. In the emergency room on arrival , her blood
pressure was in the 120s , 98% on room air , she was febrile. She
was given levofloxacin , Flagyl and ampicillin. A Gastrointestinal
consult was called.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C , grade 4
esophageal varices , encephalopathy , status
post a frontal craniotomy , status post a motor vehicle accident
with a subdural hematoma , peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Spironolactone 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
olanzapine unknown dose , Flagyl which she
had completed her course for Clostridium difficile , albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers , lactulose 120 mg q.6h. , Lopressor 50 mg
t.i.d. , Serax 30 mg , Duragesic patch , Neomycin 2 grams q.i.d. ,
Oxazepam 30 mg q.h.s. and 15 mg q.8h. p.r.n.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with one of her daughters. She
has a remarkable history of tobacco for 30 years ,
one pack per day , recently quit.
FAMILY HISTORY: Non-contributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 101.1 , heart rate
99-120 , blood pressure 94-149/55-71 , oxygen
saturation 99% on room air. GENERAL: She was a well-nourished ,
well-developed lady who was confused and agitated. HEENT:
Remarkable for icteric sclera. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIOVASCULAR:
She had a regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 normal. Jugular
venous pressure was flat. ABDOMEN: Positive for bowel sounds ,
soft , but distended. She reports tenderness on palpation. RECTAL:
Guaiac-positive per emergency department. EXTREMITIES: Her right
lower extremity had erythema , painful to the touch , no warmth and
no cords. NEUROLOGICAL: Positive for asterixis. She was alert
and oriented to person , but not to time and confused about the
place. She was unable to carry on a conversation and unable to
keep attentive. Her strength was 5/5 and her sensation was intact.
LABORATORY: Laboratory data was remarkable for a sodium of 130 ,
potassium 4.9 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 17 , BUN 9 ,
creatinine 0.8 and glucose 100. Her ALT was 16 , AST 72 , alkaline
phosphatase 118 , amylase 15 and lipase 33. Her ammonia level was
45 , albumin 3.2 , total bilirubin 2.4. Her hematocrit was 29.1.
Her INR was 1.4. EKG was normal sinus rhythm. Abdominal CT scan
showed that she had no abscess , no obstruction , no acute abdominal
process.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Gastrointestinal: At the time of admission ,
it was a confusing picture for increased
abdominal girth , however the CT scan showed that she had very
little ascites and on examination , little tenderness. Therefore ,
she got a paracentesis which was negative for spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis. The patient was treated with cefotaxime and Flagyl
for possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis , continued on the
lactulose and her diuretics. However , the patient much improved
from the gastrointestinal standpoint and after resolution of her
infectious picture ( see below ) , the patient was doing incredibly
well with spironolactone and Lasix. She has not been able to
tolerate her beta blocker secondary to hypotension. During her
hospitalization , her hematocrit has been stable. A
gastrointestinal consult was obtained. I appreciate their input.
They recommend to follow up with the Transplant Team. She has an
appointment to see the Transplant Team on July , 2002. At this
time , it is recommended that she begin to get work-up for a liver
transplant. However , her hematocrit and her INR remained stable
throughout the hospitalization.
2 ) Infectious disease: The patient was negative for spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis , however on the second day of
hospitalization , she grew out 4/4 bottles with gram positive cocci
in pairs which speciated to be Streptococcus Group B. Therefore ,
the antibiotics were tailored and she was started on nafcillin
intravenously. The patient then had a PICC line placed and she
will continue treatment of two weeks with intravenous penicillin.
The patient has been doing very well with resolution of her
erythema. Infectious Disease Service consult was obtained. I
appreciate their input. They suggested two weeks of intravenous
penicillin.
3 ) Cardiovascular/hematology: Given the swelling of the leg , the
patient had lower extremity ultrasounds which were negative for
clot. Otherwise , she remained in normal sinus rhythm and no
symptoms of congestive heart failure.
4 ) Psychiatry: The patient was very confused , most likely
delirium. Psychiatry input was greatly appreciated. Another
reason for her confusion was the fact that she was getting much
benzodiazepines at her rehabilitation before. She was weaned off
her benzodiazepines and started on olanzapine and titrated up as
tolerated. Therefore , we highly recommend avoiding benzodiazepines
in this patient and continue with olanzapine which can take p.r.n.
as well as needed.
5 ) Vascular: Vascular Surgery followed this patient during her
hospitalization and deemed that her splenorenal shunt was working
well with no evidence of leak.
DISPOSITION: The patient is sent to rehabilitation for further
treatment and finishing of her antibiotic course. At
this point , she has requested a new primary care physician and this
will be myself. I will follow her with an appointment in July ,
which I have scheduled for her.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Nexium 20 mg p.o. q. day , olanzapine 5
mg p.o. q. PM and olanzapine 2.5 mg p.o.
q.8h. p.r.n. , Atrovent inhalers , Azmacort , spironolactone 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , penicillin 3 million units intravenously q.4h. for a
complete course of two weeks , Nico-Derm 14 mg a day topical ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. which is to be held if her systolic
blood pressure is less than 100 , lactulose 30 ml p.o. t.i.d. ,
Motrin p.r.n. for pain and Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day.

cath '91 , h/o CHF , now presenting with 2 episodes
of ?syncope. First episode while sitting ,
?LOC , second episode while leaning over , likely no
LOC , both episodes without pre- or
post-syncopal SOB/palpitations/lightheadedness/confusion
or other sx. In ED had Lleg/armpain and HA.
Had negative Head CT , neg Lextremity films.
Meds noteable for extensive cardiac regimen
including lopressor , coumadin ,
amio , norvasc , lisinopril , lasix , isordil. CXR showed mild CHF
?Lbase effusion. ECHO 18 of January EF65% , EKG old inferior
MI changes/primary AVblock. Noted bradycardia to
30s while asleep on night of
admission CV: unclear etiology of syncopal episodes but
CV likely given her history. Will call Cards
consult in a.m. Important to assess specific
etiology given need for coumadin for MVR versus fall
risk with the syncopal episodes.Orthostatics
negative. Cardiology consulted , and recommended an event monitor to
assess for specific rhythms while she is symptomatic. Over her hospital
course , she had one episode of near-syncope similar to her weekend
symptoms. There was no typical rhythm noted on telemetry at that time.
Cardiology recommended monitoring HR and BP and consider d/c'ing
Lopressor if it is excessively low and correlating with symptoms.
Would follow up on event monitor to determine need for further
intervention.
Neuro: Head MR negative; ruled out intracranial
ischemia/bleed. Heme: INR 4.3 on admission and restarted after holding
for one day. Restarted coumadin at usual home dosing. On 7/10 INR was
2.1 so arranged for 4days of Lovenox to be given if INR is not
therapeutic.
Follow up plan: Event monitor to be ordered. Patient to follow up with
Dr. Bergerson and Dr. Gamma in 1-2 weeks. Visiting nurse to do home safety
eval , and monitor INR/administer Lovenox if needed , and check
BP/HR/symptoms.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: For visiting nurse: Please draw blood qd for 5 days to check INR. If it
is less than 2 please give the Lovenox injections for the day. If it
remains in 2-3 range , just continue the regular Coumadin dosing. Please
check BP and heart rate and call primary doctor Dr. Mickles if it is
excessively low or high and patient is complaining of symptoms. Please
ensure she is wearing her event monitor.

TEAM: S Terchu Fay
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: The condition responsible for causing this
admission is pneumonia.
LIST OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES: COPD , CAD , diabetes type
2 , hypertension , TIA , TVD , psoriasis.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 70-year-old female
with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , COPD , diabetes type
2 who was admitted with dyspnea and tachycardia on the 10/28/06.
The patient reported a history of cough with productive sputum x3
days and chest pain pleuritic in nature. She denied any nausea ,
vomiting , any bowel or bladder symptoms. She denied headache ,
fatigue , anorexia. Per her family , the patient had a fever to
103 and some confusion while reportedly at home. In the
Emergency Department at Re Memorial Hospital , she was tachypneic to the 40s
sating upper 80s on room air and had a fingerstick glucose of 30.
An ABG was consistent with a respiratory acidosis , pH of 7.3 ,
pCO2 of 55 , pO2 of 63 , sating 89% on 2 L. An admission chest
x-ray demonstrated an opacity at the left base. An EKG showed
some left-sided strain unchanged from prior. She received
azithromycin and ceftriaxone in the Emergency Department as well
as vancomycin and was started on BiPAP and transferred to the
MICU. In the MICU , she was treated as a COPD flare with
steroids , antibiotics , and nebulizers , however , the patient began
to tire and developed worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure
so was intubated on the night of the admission and extubated five
days later. Over the course of her MICU admission , she developed
AFib and had a troponin leak. Otherwise , the stay was
unremarkable and she extubated without complication and
transferred to the GMS Services on 4/8/06.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis
Monday , Wednesday and Friday. The renal failure is secondary to
renal artery stenosis. Hemodialysis began in April 2005.
Diabetes type 2 with hemoglobin A1c of 5.8. COPD , no PFTs are
available. Hypertension. Coronary artery disease with history
of remote MI , diastolic dysfunction/CHF. TIA for which she
receives Coumadin. Bilateral fem-pop bypasses , psoriasis and a
perforated appendix.

81 , iron t.i.d. , Paxil 10 , Nephrocaps daily , Flovent and
Combivent doses unknown.
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS TO THE GMS SERVICE: Diltiazem 90 p.o.
q.i.d. , Lopressor 37.5 q.i.d. , aspirin , albuterol , PhosLo ,
Colace , Pepcid , insulin NPH 15 units b.i.d. , Nicotine patch ,
nystatin , prednisone taper , betamethasone , captopril 50 t.i.d. ,
Coumadin 2 , simvastatin 20 , an Aspart sliding scale and p.r.n.
lactulose , Zyprexa and Ativan.
ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is an active smoker , smokes about a pack and
a half a day for the past 55 years. Lives with her daughter , has
9 children.
PHYSICAL EXAM UPON TRANSFER TO THE GMS SERVICE: Weight 92.9 ,
temperature is 96.2 , heart rate 118 AFib , BP 107/57 , sating 95%
on 2 L. In general , she appeared younger than stated age. She
had a psoriatic rash on her right thigh. Neuro exam , she was
hard of hearing , otherwise her cranial nerves were intact and she
was alert and oriented x3. Head and neck exam notable for JVP of
5 cm of water. Mucous membranes were moist. Her oropharynx was
clear. Her extraocular motions were full. Her cardiac exam , she
had a regular rhythm without appreciable murmurs , rubs or
gallops , no heaves. Lungs , she had expiratory wheezing without
rhonchi or crackles. Abdomen , although distended but soft , no
laparotomy scar , normoactive bowel sounds without guarding. She
had a Port-A-Cath in her right chest that appeared clean , dry and
intact. Extremities , she had TEDs and SCDs , bilateral pedal
edema , they were warm.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. From a Pulmonary Standpoint: Pneumonia/COPD flare. The patient was
admitted with pneumonia and COPD flare for which she needed to be intubated and
had a short MICU stay. She did well on antibiotics and was
changed from ceftriaxone , azithromycin , and vancomycin to
levofloxacin which she completed a ten-day course. She also
started on steroid taper and will leave with 20 mg of prednisone
for two more days and then 10 mg of prednisone for three days.
Upon transfer to the floor , she was restarted on Combivent and
Flovent and received p.r.n. albuterol nebulizers and albuterol
inhaler on a q.4 basis. Smoking cessation was emphasized with
the patient. Ace consult was called and the nicotine patch was
continued. She was given a flu vaccine while in the hospital.
The blood cultures and sputum cultures were unrevealing and her
O2 saturation was titrated to greater than 93%.
2. From an endocrine perspective she had a history of diabetes
type 2. She was fleetingly placed on Portland protocol while in
MICU and then transferred to NPH 15 b.i.d. insulin and NovoLog
sliding scale. She should continue her aspirin and ACE inhibitor
as an outpatient and later her hemoglobin A1c was consistent with
very well controlled diabetic.
3. From a cardiovascular standpoint:
A. Ischemia. Her troponin peaked to 0.38 on 11/22/06 while in
the MICU. It was not associated with any dynamic EKG changes ,
however , her EKG does show some evidence of strain versus
infralateral ischemia with T-waves inversions in the inferior and
lateral leads. Her troponin trended down over the course of the
admission and on last check were less than 0.2. There was a
question of whether this leak was due to volume overload versus
infection. Her aspirin , statin , beta-blocker , and ACE were
continued. Her fasting lipid profile was remarkable only for
hypertriglyceridemia and HDL of 38. She is scheduled for a
outpatient nuclear medicine stress test on 8/13/06 at 09:00 a.m.
B. Rate. She was noted to be in AFib on the MICU and rate was
controlled with diltiazem and Lopressor titrated to heart rate of
80 , she was monitored on tele over the course of admission. She
was already in Coumadin for TIAs , however , the new INR goal for
her is between 2 and 3 and Coumadin levels should be checked at
the time of dialysis.
C. Pump. Her EF was 55% on echo that was done while in the
MICU. There is some evidence of aortic sclerosis , otherwise ,
there is no hypokinesis or wall motion abnormalities noted.
4. From a hematologic standpoint , she was started on epopoietin
for anemia of chronic disease. Her baseline hematocrit of 35
dropped to 26 while in the MICU and she received a unit of blood
for that. Following that transfusion , her hematocrit was stable
in the lower to mid 30s. She was also restarted on iron , which
she takes as an outpatient. Her stool is guaiac negative over
the course of the admission.
5. From a GI perspective , the patient had a mild transaminitis
noted while in the MICU thought likely secondary to hepatic
congestion. Viral serologies were drawn including hep B and C ,
which were negative. Her transaminitis resolved on its own.
6. From a dermatologic perspective , the patient has a history of
psoriasis. She was continued on topical steroids with good
effect.
7. From an infectious disease standpoint , this patient has
evidence of pneumonia by clinical exam and chest x-ray on
admisison , which appeared to be resolved. She completed a
ten-day course of levofloxacin. In addition , multiple cultures
were taken while in the MICU including that from the A line which
grew out coag-negative staph thought likely to be a contaminate.
8. Neuro exam , she was alert and oriented and intact upon
transfer to the medical service. For history of TIAs her
Coumadin was continued.
9. FEN. The patient was started on a renal diabetic low-fat
diet and was fluid restricted to 2 L a day.
10. Renal. The patient is on dialysis Monday , Wednesday , and
Friday for end-stage renal disease secondary to RAS. She is
followed by renal and had a renal attending during the course of
this hospitalization. She was started on Neutra-Phos ,
Nephrocaps , and her PhosLo was continued. Her calcium and
phosphorus were monitored q.a.m. and her IPTH was checked and was
415.
11. Prophylaxis. Heparin was continued subcu until her INR was
therapeutic. She still is on VRE precautions for a positive
rectal swab.
She was a full code.
Discharge medications will be included as an addendum.

Discharge Date: 2/15/1993
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Mcguirl is a 44 year old man with a
history of hypertension and a family
history of coronary artery disease who presents with new onset of
chest pain. He has been previously treated at the PH for
hypertension. He has no cardiac history , no prior history of chest
pain. He ran out of his blood pressure medicines approximately one
week prior to presentation. He was feeling well until the day of
admission while at work when he noted onset of substernal chest
pain while seated. He was diaphoretic , nauseated , but had no
vomiting. He also had some shortness of breath but no
palpitations. He went to SH with the same pain and an
electrocardiogram showed LVH with strain. He was given oxygen and
sublingual Nitroglycerin without relief. He was sent to the
Rahoag Hospital emergency room. There , he was treated
with Magnesium Sulfate , IV Lopressor , IV Nitroglycerin , and
sublingual Nifedipine. His blood pressure at WMC had been 210/150.
His pain then resolved with a total of approximately five hours.
He was entirely pain-free since his treatment in the emergency
room. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for only hypertension. He
was on three medications which he is unsure of , including
Captopril. He apparently had good blood pressure control with his
blood pressure medication. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Captopril of unknown dose; Hydrochloro-
thiazide 15 mg po q day; Diltiazem of unknown dose. FAMILY
HISTORY: Significant for his father who died of myocardial
infarction at age 50. SOCIAL HISTORY: He works as a plumber at
Hunt Ca He does not drink and does not smoke.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is a middle-aged , black man , in no
apparent distress. His blood pressure was
140/100 , pulse 76 , afebrile. Head and neck exam showed PERRL ,
oropharynx was benign. Neck was supple and no adenopathy. Lungs
were clear to auscultation. His cardiovascular exam revealed a
regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , an S4 gallop. No
murmurs or rubs , no jugular venous distention , and his carotids
were 2+ bilaterally. Abdomen; good bowel sounds , no hepato-
splenomegaly , no masses. Extremities; no clubbing , cyanosis , or
edema. Neurologic exam was non-focal.
LABORATORY EVALUATION: potassium 4.9 , BUN 11 , creatinine 1.1 ,
glucose 134 , hematocrit 44.6 , white count of
11 , and platelets of 223. CK was 215. PT was 12.1 , PTT 30.1. His
electrocardiogram showed him to be in normal sinus rhythm at 83
beats per minute , normal intervals , axis was -29. He did have LVH
with strain. His chest x-ray showed no pulmonary vascular
redistribution , no effusions or infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the coronary care unit
and ruled in for a myocardial infarction. His
peak CK was 453 with MB fraction of 16.5. He was in the coronary
care unit for one day , after which he was transferred to the floor.
He had no arrhythmias or complications of his myocardial
infarction. Echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderate
concentric LVH with moderate chamber enlargement , posterolateral
hypokinesis , and ejection fraction of 45% , and moderate mitral
regurgitation with thickened mitral valve leaflets. His
hypertension was initially controlled with Lopressor 150 mg three
times a day. He was then changed to Atenolol and Captopril. With
these medications , he had good blood pressure control. One week
after his myocardial infarction , he underwent an exercise tolerance
test MIBI. He went for 9 minutes on his exercise tolerance test
and stopped due to completion of his protocol. He had no chest
pain or shortness of breath and no ischemic changes on his EKG , and
reached a peak blood pressure of 180/85 and a peak pulse of 94.
His MIBI images showed a fixed defect in the apical anterior
lateral wall , but no reversible changes , consistent with myocardial
infarction but no ischemia. He is discharged to home in stable
condition.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
78 yo man who presents with 2 episodes of SSCP. Recently had MV and TV
repair with SVG to OM1. Reported to have 80% diag , 70% LCX from a cath
in Ohio in 3/1 Also h/o HTN , DM 2 ( diet controlled ) , AF ,
ventricular pacemaker , ischemic CMP , EF 30%. CP occurred while at
rest , no radiation and no associated symptoms. 1st episode was 10/8 ,
resolved spontaneously. Came to ED , EKG was paced , CK flat , TnI
elevated at 0.17 , similar to value on 4/21 when pt came in for a TIA.
Mr. Faiella was sent home with sl nitro. Pain occurred again while
watching TV , resolved with one sl nitro. Was admitted for workup of
possible ischemia. Currently CP free.
1. CV: Ischemia: ruled out for MI , added isordil to regimen , ASA.
Continue carvedilol , captopril. Likely to have CAD , Adenosine MIBI
revealed fixed inf/lat defect , consistent with LCX disease. No
reversible defects. Since chest pain is unlikely to be cardiac in
origin , will stop nitrates. Pt was able to amubulate w/o SOB or CP
CHF: euvolemic. continue lasix , aldactone , digoxin.
2. Endo: DM 2 , diet controlled. HbA1C 5.8%
3. Renal: baseline Cr 2.0
4. Neuro: recent history of TIA , on coumadin , may not want to reverse
anticoagulation for possibility of cath.
5. Heme: coumadin was held for possible cath , but was restarted on day
of discharge.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted to the hospital for chest pain , and we have made sure
that you are not and did not have a heart attack. We also did a
perfusion test to make sure that your heart muscle is receiving
adequate amounts of blood flow. If your chest pain recurrs , gets
worse , or you become short of breath , please call you cardiologist and
return to the emergency department.

OTHER TREATMENTS/PROCEDURES ( NOT IN O.R. )

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
76yoM with CAD s/p CABG 1997 presented with 2-3 weeks of nocturnal
angina with increased nitroglycerin requirement for relief. Given
limitations of imaging modalities due to his severe spinal stenosis ,
MIBI/ETT were not feasible , so the patient presented for elective
catheterization 5/16/06. Upon catherization , two occlusions were noted in
the PLV: a 90% occlusion , as well as a moderate sized plaque.
Revascularization was achieved with the placement of non-drug alluding
stents to these lesions; the original 90% lesion was stented to 0%
occlusion. During the catheterization , Dr. Taran noted a gradient of
40mmHg from the thoracic aorta to the femoral aorta raising the
possibility of this as an etiology for Mr. Mcconnell 's severe lower back pain
and limited ability to ambulate. The catheterization was without
complications. The patient was placed on Plavix x 6 weeks and Aspirin
indefinately following the procedure , and continued on his home regimen
of Captopril , Metoprolol , Isordil , Digoxin , Spironalactone , Insulin ,
Lasix , Zocor and prn Nitroglycerin. Groin sheaths were removed and the
patient was without hematoma or bruit. He had 2 episodes of chest
pressure several hours following the procedure with negative EKG and
stable vitals; the symptoms resolved with oxycodone and did not recur.
On discharge he was ambulating confortably without chest pain or shortness
of breath.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take your Aspirin and Plavix. The Aspirin needs to be taken every
day on a long term basis , and the Plavix must be taken for ATLEAST 6
WEEKS from 10/29
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Please follow up with your Cardiologist , Dr. Golaszewski
Please take your Plavix 75mg for 6 weeks ( until atleast 3/12/06 )
Take your Aspirin 325mg indefinately
Please reschedule appointment with Dr. Kuick to receive steroid
injections for spinal stenosis until AFTER your course of Plavix is
complete

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
89 F Bagreen Con Ri woman with CAD s/p multiple PCI , CHF , anxiety , GER
D , atrial fibrillation , and profoundly demented at baseline ,
admitted via ED on 6/10/4 with SSCP , mild volume overload and
inability to cope at home. Has had multiple identical admissions over
the past year. Felt not to be a candidate for further
coronary iintervention. Admitted for ROMI , gentle
diuresis and mainly for placement issues.
Course:
1. CV:
-Ischemia: Ruled out by 3 sets of cardiac enzymes. No ischemic
changes on EKG. She was maintained on cardiac regimen: ASA , Isordil ,
statin , BB , ACEI. No further risk stratification was performed as
stated above.
-Pump: Mildly volume overloaded on admission. Was gently diuresed and t
hen changed back to baseline lasix PO dosing.
-Rhythm: Atrial fibrillation intermittently with sinus rhythm. Not
candidate for anticoagulation. Was bradycardic ( HR 40s-60s ) but
asymptomatic during course. Atenolol was changed to TID dosing of
lopressor given CRI ( Cr 1.9 ) and worry that renal clearance of drug
was impaired.
2. Psych: Demented at baseline. Continued home meds: remeron , zyprexa ,
dilantin.
3. Prophy: Will continue prophylactic dosing of lovenox at rehab ( not
contraindicated even with CRI ).
4. Dispo: Pt will be discharged to skilled nursing facility after
extensive discussions with family. Pt should follow up with PCP when
ready to leave Wellnorhamcypress Hospital 120-824-5764 Dr. Hamann

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: HOGGE , WILLIAMS DAREN MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Elective right total knee replacement.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70-year-old woman
with multiple medical problems including asthma , interstitial
lung disease and autoimmune hepatitis leading to cirrhosis with
varices , hypersplenism and thrombocytopenia. Prior to admission
she lived with her husband and was independent with activities of
daily living. She was limited by right knee pain. She was
admitted to Roundcleod Valley Medical Center 9/2/05 for elective
right total knee replacement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Migraine headaches , interstitial lung
disease , asthma , reflux , hepatitis A , autoimmune hepatitis
leading to cirrhosis with varices , hypersplenism , and
thrombocytopenia , coagulopathy , chronic diarrhea x10 years ,
status post cholecystectomy , osteoporosis , L4 compression
fracture , osteoarthritis.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Valium.
2. Advair.
3. Combivent.
4. Prednisone
5. Nexium.
6. Propranolol.
7. Lasix.
8. Spironolactone.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient does not smoke cigarettes or drink
alcohol. She is married with four children.
ADMISSION LABS: Potassium 4.3 , white blood cell count 9.9 ,
hematocrit 26.3 , platelets 61 , INR 1.3.
ADMISSION EXAM: First documented by the orthopedic team: Alert
and oriented , afebrile. Pulse in the 70s and sinus. Blood
pressure in the 90s/50s. Satting 100% on 2 liters. Thin ,
elderly woman , faint bibasilar crackles. Regular rate and
rhythm. Abdomen: Soft and nontender. Extremities: Warm.
ADMISSION IMAGING: Portable chest x-ray on 10/11/05 with patchy
opacity in the left lung base , likely atelectasis.
ADMISSION EKG: Normal sinus rhythm , normal axis. QTC 464. LVH ,
T-wave inversion in 3 , T-wave flattening in AVF , T-wave
flattening in V3 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Ortho: Right knee replacement. The patient underwent an
uncomplicated right knee replacement on admission. Subsequently
her leg was immobilized as per orthopedic recommendations. The
reason for immobilization was that movement of the right lower
extremity might precipitate skin tears.
2. Skin: The patient incurred a laceration in her left calf
perioperatively. She also incurred a skin tear on 11/29/05 with
turning in the bed. Her skin was noted to be paper thin with
underlying fluid. Wound healing was impaired secondary to low
albumin and chronic steroid use. The patient was seen by the
Plastic Surgery team. This team recommended appropriate
dressings for the patient's skin tears. The team also grafted
the left thigh skin tear. The patient was treated with
supplemental vitamins to promote wound healing including vitamin
A and zinc. She was also treated with antibiotics to prevent
skin infections. Originally she had been on vancomycin for a
urinary tract infection and when the course was complete for the
urinary tract infection , the patient was switched to Keflex for
prophylaxis versus skin infections.
3. GI: End stage liver disease with varices and
thrombocytopenia. The patient's complete metabolic panel and
coags were checked each day. During the course of her
hospitalization , the patient's transaminases were relatively
stable , but her alkaline phosphatase trended upward. On exam ,
the patient had mild right upper quadrant tenderness which she
reported was chronic. On 5/13/05 , the patient underwent an
abdominal ultrasound to evaluate her right upper quadrant
tenderness and elevated alk/phos. This study revealed a 2.0 x
1.6 x 1.6 cm hyperechoic mass in the portahepatis. This study
also showed evidence of cirrhosis as well as common bile duct
dilation and splenomegaly. A CT scan to further evaluate the
portahepatic mass was recommended. For her autoimmune hepatitis ,
the patient was continued on prednisone. For her varices , she
was continued on propranolol. Her Lasix and spironolactone were
held through much of her hospitalization. On 6/19/05 , her Lasix
was restarted in an attempt to remedy her hyponatremia.
4. Low albumin state: The patient has a low prealbumin
suggestive of decreased PO intake versus decreased synthetic
function of the liver. The patient also has chronic diarrhea and
was thought to be wasting protein. The patient refused ??___??
placement for tube feeds. She was initially on a house diet with
Ensure and Boost supplements as well as MVI and lactinex
granules. The patient was not taking in adequate calories. On
6/19/05 , TPN was initiated.
5. Persistent chronic diarrhea: The patient has a history of
chronic diarrhea. Stool studies including C. diff testing was
negative. The patient was also tested for celiac sprue and this
testing , too , came back negative. The patient was treated
symptomatically with Imodium.
6. GERD: This patient was treated with Nexium and p.r.n.
Maalox.
7. Dysphagia: The patient reported trouble swallowing. She was
evaluated by the Speech and Swallow team on 4/6/05. Her
swallowing function was noted to be intact.
8. Infectious Disease:
Postoperative prophylaxis: Immediately postoperatively , the
patient was initially treated with clindamycin for prophylaxis
versus perioperative infection.
Skin Prophylaxis: The patient was initially treated with
vancomycin and switched to Keflex.
Urinary tract infection: The patient had a series of dirty UA's.
She was ultimately treated with vancomycin for a urine culture
that grew out resistant staph species. She finished her course
of vancomycin on 8/7/05. A repeat UA was noted to be positive
for infection. A repeat urine culture is pending.
Odynophagia: The patient reported trouble swallowing. She was
treated empirically with fluconazole and clotrimazole for
esophageal Candida. This treatment did not remedy her pain in
swallowing. The patient then developed mouth sores. HSV swabs
of these sores are pending. The patient was treated
symptomatically with viscous lidocaine.
9. Pulmonary: The patient has a history of interstitial lung
disease and asthma. She was treated with Combivent and standing
nebulizer treatments. On 8/6/05 , the patient was noted to have
a new oxygen requirement of 3 to 4 liters. Differential
diagnosis was PE versus pneumonia versus volume overload. On
8/6/05 , the patient had a chest x-ray which showed left lower
lobe atelectasis. A repeat chest x-ray on 10/17/05 was read as
normal. On 7/15/05 , the patient was weaned down to room air.
10. Neuro:
Pain: The patient was treated with standing codeine sulfate.
Nausea: The patient was treated with p.r.n. Compazine.
11. Cardiovascular:
Pump: The patient has no known heart failure. In terms of her
volume status , she was deemed to be intravascularly depleted as
evidenced by prerenal urine electrolytes. She was thought ,
however , to be total body volume overloaded. It was thought that
in the setting of her low albumin , she was third-spacing fluid.
The patient was intermittently treated with normal saline and
spa. On 6/19/05 , normal saline was held and the patient was
treated with spa in conjunction with Lasix.
Rhythm: The patient had normal sinus rhythm. She was monitored
on telemetry.
Ischemia: The patient has no known history of coronary artery
disease. She had no chest pain. Her cardiac markers were
negative. Her EKG had nonspecific abnormalities. She was
continued on her beta-blocker. She was not on an aspirin given
her thrombocytopenia.
12. Renal: Decreased urine output. From the day of admission
onward , the patient had relative oliguria , 500 to 900 cc of urine
per day approximately. Her creatinine trended downward from a
value of 0.5 on admission down to as low as 0.2. As noted above ,
the patient was intermittently treated with normal saline and spa
versus spa and Lasix.
13. Hyponatremia: The patient developed asymptomatic
hyponatremia. This hyponatremia was not responsive to fluid
restriction. On 6/19/05 , the patient was treated with Lasix and
spa as noted above. TSH , cortisol and uric acid were checked to
rule out other etiologies of hyponatremia. The results of these
studies are pending.
14. Endocrine: The patient has steroid induced diabetes. She was
treated with Lantus and sliding scale insulin.
15. Heme: Anemia: The patient had normal iron studies , B12 and
folate.
16. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is most
likely secondary to splenic sequestration. An antiplatelet
factor 4 test was sent and is pending.
17. Anticoagulation: The patient had two indications for
anticoagulation. The first was right total knee replacement.
The second was a right lower extremity superficial femoral DVT
discovered on 10/16/05. The goal INR for this patient was
determined to be 1.5 to 2. It was thought that the patient was
at bleeding risk with a higher INR given her known varices and
her thrombocytopenia. From 8/21/05 onward , the patient's INR was
supertherapeutic and her Coumadin was held. It was thought that
the supertherapeutic INR could relate to Coumadin effects versus
nutritional deficiencies versus worsening of her function.
18. Musculoskeletal: Osteoporosis: The patient was treated with
cholecalciferol.
19. Physical therapy: The patient was followed by the Physical
Therapy team.
20. Access: The patient had a PIC line in place.
Discharge medications , the remainder of the hospital course and
disposition will be dictated by Dr. Steven Jaksic

region of the pancreatic head. EKG showed her to be in sinus
tachycardia with the rate of 122. She had a left axis deviation in
Qs and V1.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for pancreatitis , asthma ,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , history
of vascular necrosis of both hips , status post a total hip
replacement on the right as well as a total hip replacement on the
left. She has known coronary artery disease , history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease , history of GI bleed. Status post a
Nissen fundoplication with redo. Hypertension. Alpha thalassemia.
History of congestive heart failure. Chronic low back pain

children. She lives alone.
After admission to the medical service , she was seen by the
surgical service in consultation. Based on clinical findings and
laboratory values , a repeat abdominal CT study was ordered with a
plan for CT guided drainage to rule out a pancreatic abscess. The
CT guided aspirate appeared purulent and was sent for gram and
cultures. Gram stain was positive for gram negative rods and gram
positive cocci in pairs actually growing out Strep viridans and
Klebsiella.
While in the hospital , the patient also developed a urinary tract
infection with yeast , and was started on fluconazole. This too ,
she will be discharged with , to complete a seven-day course. As
well , the patient was felt to have peptic ulcer disease , and was
begun on H. pylori therapy of Biaxin and bismuth , both of which she
will be discharged on to complete a seven-day course. At the time
of discharge , the patient is relatively pain-free , tolerating a
p.o. diet , and afebrile. The plan is to discharge her to the

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Ms. Dinwoodie it was a pleasure to take care of you during your
hospitalization. We have made some changes to your medications. We
increased your blood pressure medication: Lisinopril from 5mg to 15mg
once a day. We started you on a medication for anemia: ferrous
gluconate which you should take 3 times a day along with colace a stool
softener which you should take twice a day. We also increased your lasix
frm 20mg once a day to 40mg twice a day. As discussed with you , your
echocardiogram ( ultrasound of your heart ) showed that you had some
abnormality with the functioning of your heart which may in part explain
your shortness of breath especially on exertion. It is extremely important
to follow up with your primary care physician Dr. Clague appt 7/12 at
12:10pm and your cardiologist Dr. Dodgen on 2/16 at 1:30pm. If you
have trouble breathing , have chest pain please seek medical attention as
soon as possible.

after a recent discharge from Ouh On Valley Health
during , which she was treated for pneumonia. The patient had a
recent admission to Harbanburkehead Health from 3/25/06 to
4/3/06 , during which she was treated for a urinary tract

ALLERGIES: Sulfa , azathioprine , sertraline , and metoclopramide.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient never smoked , use alcohol or drugs.
Her son is very involved and confirms that the patient is
DNR/DNI.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the temperature is 98.6 ,
heart rate 70 , respiratory rate 16 , blood pressure 133/61 , oxygen
saturation was 79% on room air and increased in 94% on 3 L nasal
cannula. In general , the patient appeared comfortable with
pleasant and convulsant and blind. Neck showed a JVP of 7.
Chest exam was with left basilar crackles no wheezes. Heart was
regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at
the left upper sternal border. Abdomen was soft , nontender , and
nondistended with normal bowel sounds. Extremities with no
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission were significant for potassium of
4.5 , BUN of 23 , creatinine 1.6 , which is at her baseline of 1.4
to 1.6. White blood cell count of 5.7 , hematocrit 27.3 from a
baseline of 26 to 29 , platelets of 347 , 000. Coagulation studies
were normal. Liver function tests were normal. Cardiac enzymes
were negative. Chest x-ray showed no change in the left lower
lobe infiltrate , since 10/20/06. An EKG showed Q-wave
flattening , but no changes from her prior EKGs. Normal sinus
rhythm.
IMPRESSION: This is an 86-year-old woman with multiple medical
problems including congestive heart failure , diabetes , and
adrenal insufficiency , who presents with recurrent fevers through
levofloxacin and vancomycin.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Infectious Disease. Initially , the source of her repeated
fevers was unclear. Multiple cultures were sent including urine
cultures , stool studies , peripheral blood cultures and blood
cultures from the PICC sputum cultures and induced sputum with
testing for PCP , given her history of chronic steroid uses
without PCP prophylaxis. All of these came back negative with
the exception of one blood culture from the PICC , which grew
coagulase negative Staphylococcus aureus. So , the PICC line was
discontinued and the tip sent for culture , which was negative.
After discontinuation of the PICC line , the patient did not have
any further fevers. The remainder of her admission , which was
greater than 72 hours. The induced sputum for PCP was also
negative and the patient was then started on PCP prophylaxis with
Mepron ( given her sulfa allergy ) to be continued until she had
completed her gradual tapper off of steroids. She completed the
levofloxacin and vancomycin courses , which were started on the
previous admission , for pneumonia and did not have any further
fevers after completing these antibiotics. A PPD was placed ,
which was negative.
2. Endocrine. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism ,
adrenal insufficiency secondary to chronic steroids in the past
and insulin-dependent diabetes. Her TSH was checked and was
normal on admission. So , she was continued on her home dose of
Synthroid. Further instructions through her primary care
provider. Her hydrocortisone was slightly decreased and her slow
taper will be further directed by her primary care provider after
discharge. Her insulin regimen was up titrated with the addition
of the q.a.c. Novalog , given her high fingerstick blood glucoses.
She should continue on this increased regimen after discharge.
3. Pulmonary. On admission , the patient was noted to be hypoxic
on room air with an oxygen saturation of 79% to 80% , which
increased to 93% on 2 L to 3 L of nasal cannula. Given this new
hypoxia and her chronic decreased ambulation , she was sent for a
CT angiogram of the chest , which was negative for PE. The study
also shows small bilateral pleural effusion and mild pulmonary
edema. Resolution of her previous pneumonia and possibly
reactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Given this data , she was
restarted on Lasix with diuresis , titrated to 1 L negative per
day and was sound well. Given this data , she was restarted on
Lasix with the diuresis titrated to 1 L negative per day and
responded well. She had decreasing shortness of breath and
improved room air oxygen saturation up to 85% at the time of
discharge. She is continued to be maintained on oxygen of 2 L
nasal cannula with good oxygen saturation and is anticipated to
have a successful gradual wean from oxygen as her diuresis
continue after discharge. The Pulmonary Service was consulted
and followed her agreeing with the diagnosis of pulmonary edema.
They also recommended a followup noncontrast chest CT in 2 to 4
weeks after discharge to reevaluate her mediastinal
lymphadenopathy after a period of diuresis. A followup
appointment was made with Dr. Soucek at the Chest Clinic at
Sio Sane Hospital for two weeks following discharge.
Pulmonary function test were completed , which showed a
restrictive defect , which the Pulmonary Service felt could be
attributed to her volume overload. An echo showed an increased
pulmonary artery systolic pressure at 47 plus the right atrial
pressure consistent with previous echo done in September of 2005.
Thus , this was not considered to be new pathology , nor likely
related to her new hypoxia.
4. Hematologic. The patient has a known diagnosis of iron
deficiency anemia as well as anemia of chronic disease and is
maintaining on iron and epoetin as an outpatient. There were no
signs or symptoms of bleeding throughout this admission and she
not required a blood transfusion at any point. She should
continue on her outpatient regimen of iron and epoetin after
discharge. Iron studies done on this admission showed adequate
iron repletion with her current regimen.
5. Cardiovascular. There was no evidence of ischemia throughout
the admission. Given her findings of pulmonary edema on chest CT
and her history of diastolic congestive heart failure , she was
started on Lasix 20 mg IV b.i.d. with effective diuresis noted.
This was transitioned to a p.o. regimen of 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
which will be continued after discharge and titrated to her
weight loss. She was also continued on her outpatient Zocor ,
Norvasc and lisinopril.
6. Renal. The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency. She received Mucomyst and bicarbonate in her IV
fluids , prior to her CT angiogram of the chest with prophylaxis
against contrast nephropathy. Her creatinine remained stable at
1.6 for remainder of the admission , which was greater than 72
hours. All mediations were appropriately renally dosed. She
should continue followup with her primary care provider regarding
her chronic renal insufficiency in the future.
7. Fluid , Electrolytes , and Nutrition. The patient was
maintained on any IV fluids except as prophylaxis for her CT
angiogram. The potassium and magnesium were repeated as needed
and she was maintained on the renal , cardiac ADA diet.
8. Prophylaxis: She was maintained on t.i.d. subq heparin for
DVT prophylaxis and Nexium for GI prophylaxis as well as an
aggressive bowel regimen , given her history of chronic
constipation.
9. Code Status: The patient is DNR/DNI and her son John Durazo , is the healthcare proxy.
DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will be discharged back to Mclemens Hospital Of County to continue physical therapy to regain some independence
with her activities of daily living and more specifically to
regain some independence and the activities , which she enjoys
such as playing the piano. She will have followup with her
primary care provider , Dr. Pacetti regarding general plan for her
care including gradual hydrocortisone taper , her Lasix dosing and
her diabetes management. She will also followup at the chest
clinic with Dr. Tobola regarding her PCP prophylaxis and the
possibly of repeat chest CT regarding the question of her
mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen on CT during this admission.

Discharge Date: 10/4/1998
CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient is a 79 year old female with diabetes
on immunosuppressants with fever x one day of an
unclear source.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has a history of diabetes
and of PMR , maintained on prednisone
7.5 mg p.o. q day and Imuran 100 mg p.o. q day ( begun three weeks
ago ). On 9 of June the patient noticed some blood in the sink after
brushing her teeth and she felt that she had coughed this up. A
chest x-ray was done , which was within normal limits. The patient
had felt tired for the last week. Since yesterday morning , she
felt nauseated , anorexic , had some chills , and took her temperature
later in the day and found a fever of 102. The patient also had a
moderate headache , but has no nuchal rigidity and no difficulty
with moving her head. She also has an occasional cough , which has
been nonproductive , for the past few days. The patient has no
other localizing symptoms - no hemoptysis , no chest pain , no
palpitations , orthopnea , edema , dysphagia , abdominal pain ,
diarrhea , hematuria , dysuria , flank pain , vaginal discharge , edema ,
rash , joint pain , claudication or scalp tenderness. The patient
has no moved her bowels for four days , but this is not unusual for
her.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Mrs. Flippen is somewhat lethargic , though
appropriate in conversation. Vital signs:
Temperature 103.0 , blood pressure 140/70. HEENT examination:
Anicteric. The extraocular muscles are intact. The pupils were
equal , round and reactive to light. No scalp tenderness. Temporal
arteries are nontender. The oropharynx is dry with no thrush. The
neck is supple. Chest: Crackles at the left base. No jugular
venous distention. Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs , rubs or gallops.
Abdomen: Bowel sounds are positive , soft , nontender , nondistended ,
no hepatosplenomegaly or masses. Rectal examination: Guaiac
negative. Extremities: No edema. No rashes. No tenderness.
Neurological examination: 5/5 strength in all extremities.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , PMR , hypothyroidism , peripheral
neuropathy , lower back pain , osteoporosis ,
borderline hypertension , history of stroke ( difficulty playing the
piano with her right hand , mild slurring of speech , but by
discharge her symptoms of wide-based gait and slurring of speech
had resolved. )

Inderal 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 20 mg p.o. q.p.m. and 10 mg p.o.
q.h.s.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a retired Hebrew teacher. The
patient lives with her husband in a retirement
home. Tobacco - One pack per day for 20 years. Quit 20 years ago.
Alcohol - Occasional.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's mother had a stroke in her 60's.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies on admission showed a white
blood cell count of 8 , 200 , with 15 bands. ALT
18 , AST 26 , alkaline phosphatase 64 , total bilirubin 0.2 , ESR 55 ,
hematocrit 35.8. Sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , creatinine 1.3.
A spinal tap was done which revealed the gram stain revealed no
organisms , no polys and no epithelial cells. Only one white cell
was noted in the CSF , glucose 92 , protein 46. The patient's
urinalysis showed 5 - 7 white blood cells , 2+ bacteria. The
patient's chest x-ray showed no infiltrates , no free air. KUB
showed no signs of obstruction.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's Imuran was held because it was
thought that this could be a possible cause of
her fever. She was started on Ceftriaxone two grams , Mezlin and
Gentamicin in the Emergency Room. The patient's blood and urine
cultures were all negative , as was the spinal culture. The patient
improved steadily , and the day following admission she had been
afebrile x 24 hours saturating 94% on room air; therefore , the plan
was to discharge her. On the floor the patient received two grams
of Ceftazidime x one and then was taken off of antibiotics.
On the afternoon of 29 of July the patient's oxygen saturation
suddenly dropped. She complained of feeling short of breath and
nauseous. Her room air saturation was 82% when these symptoms
first developed. Over the next 30 minutes the patient
decompensated and her oxygenation was steadily increased; however ,
on 100% nonrebreather face mask her oxygen saturation was less than
80% and her skin appeared mottled. A portable chest x-ray showed
mild congestive heart failure. The patient's EKG showed a normal
sinus rhythm , no axis changes and no ST changes. The patient had
received 100 mg of IV Compazine for nausea; otherwise , no new
medications since admission. Her temperature was 100.5 at 2:00
p.m. Because of her rapid decompensation a code green was called
and she was intubated and transferred to the MICU. ABG showed a pH
of 7.35 , a pCO2 of 44 , and a pO2 of 96 following intubation. Blood
pressure remained , during this time , at 130 to 200 over 70 to 90
with heartrates in the 70's to 90's. During her rapid
decompensation the patient was given nebulizers , but with no
effect. The cause of the patient's sudden decompensation was
unclear. During the period of rapid decompensation the patient got
a total of 100 mg of IV Lasix. Her lung exam showed some crackles ,
but she did not appear to be all that wet. A chest x-ray three
hours post intubation showed diffuse fluffy infiltrates in the
bilateral lung fields , more central than peripheral. No effusion
was noted. Based on the findings of this chest x-ray , a VQ scan
was not done. It was thought that the rapid decompensation was due
to either pulmonary edema ( the patient had been on 150 cc an hour
of IV fluids for approximately 24 hours because she was dehydrated
when she first came in ) , blood , or pneumonia. The patient was
covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime ( for Pseudomonas ) ,
Levofloxacin ( for Legionella ) , and Pentamidine ( for PCP ). The
patient was also given 50 mg of IV Solu-Medrol b.i.d. Numerous
laboratory studies were sent off including: RSV , influenza ,
parainfluenza , VRE , Legionella , PCP , adenovirus , acid-fast bacilli ,
CH50 , and ANA , all of which were negative. Urine and blood
cultures were negative as well. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema was
thought to be an unlikely cause , given that she had a normal left
ventricular size and an ejection fraction of 50% in an
echocardiogram done right after being intubated. There was also no
evidence of any right ventricular dysfunction or RV strain.
She did well over the two days following intubation and was
extubated on 6 of May A bronchoscopy was considered , given the
patient's history of hemoptysis , but as the hemoptysis resolved
over the next couple of days , it was thought to be unnecessary.
The patient's oxygen saturation following extubation was 95% on
three liters nasal cannula and continued to be in the mid 90's once
she was weaned to room air in the subsequent two days. All
antibiotics were stopped while the patient was in the MICU except
for Levofloxacin , which was continued for a seven to ten day
course. The patient was gradually tapered off of the IV
Solu-Medrol and put on a p.o. prednisone taper starting at 80 mg
p.o. q day. The Pulmonary Consult Team saw her when she was back
on the floor for her continued hemoptysis , but this appeared to
resolve over the next couple of days , and , as a result , it was
decided that this need not be pursued at the present. The patient
did well over the next several days and the day prior to discharge
was saturating at 94% on room air and received 10 mg of p.o.
prednisone. The etiology of the patient's sudden decompensation
was never entirely clarified , but it appeared that flash pulmonary
edema was probably the most likely explanation , possibly due to a
viral pneumonia in conjunction with fluid overload.

ATTENDING: AL DAMIAN DUMBAR MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Stented basilar occlusion.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSIS:
None , Q-wave myocardial infarction.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES:
Cardiac catheterization done on 3/14/03.
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
This is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery
disease , diabetes mellitus , hypertension and ____ fibrillation
managed on aspirin and Plavix who presents to the Maven Health emergency department complaining of lethargy , diplopia
and vertigo. Further information regarding her symptomatology is
not currently available as the patient's initial mental status
was quite poor.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension , diabetes , glaucoma ,
hypercholesterolemia , history of alcohol abuse , history of
coronary artery disease.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Not available currently in detail but included aspirin 325 mg and
Plavix 25 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES:
She is allergic to NSAIDs , penicillin and Diltiazem.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:
Revealed her to be lethargic , obese. Her face is slightly
asymmetric with some left cheek swelling. Her neck revealed no
bruits. Her heart was irregularly irregular. Her lungs revealed
bibasilar crackles. Her extremities had 1+ pitting edema
bilaterally. Neurologic examination: The only focal findings
were a transient skewed deviation of her eyes. Further
information regarding this is not currently available. Focal
weakness and numbness were not delineated upon initial
evaluation.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit
given her initial imaging findings. These findings were that she
had an occlusion , flat high-grade stenosis of the distal basilar
artery. There was no acute infarction noted. Based on these
findings , she was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit
and placed on intravenous heparin. Her neurologic status
gradually improved throughout her hospitalization. She did not
complain of diplopia after the first day of her hospitalization.
She also was quite awake after the first day of her
hospitalization. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging done on
10/21/03 revealed a new left cerebellar infarct with persistent
high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery which did appear a bit
more patent than the initial scan done on 10/20/03. At the time
of her discharge , she was being transitioned from heparin to
Coumadin and she was neurologically intact. With regard to her
cardiovascular status , the patient initially ruled in for an MI
based on positive cardiac markers. Her peak troponin-I was 11.02
and her peak CKMB was 18.4. She had lateral T-wave inversions
that were new compared to her old EKGs. She was brought to the
cardiac catheterization laboratory where it was found that she
had multiple moderate stenoses but without any high-grade or
critical stenoses. She was found however to have an elevated
wedge pressure of approximately 30 cm. Echocardiogram done on
10/30/03 revealed an ejection fraction of 60%. She had a mildly
dilated left atrium. It was found that she had moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Her pulmonary artery pressures were
elevated to 51 mL of mercury. She also is found to have moderate
mitral regurgitation. Based on the findings of her
catheterization and elevated wedge pressures , the patient was
diuresed relatively aggressively. She was also given high doses
of beta-blockade. Her troponin and CKMB levels did decrease
after this. She remained weight controlled with beta-blockade.
There was some discussion of possibly cardioverting her , but
given her recent stroke this will be deferred. With regard to
her blood pressure management , she has been managed while at an
inpatient with hydralazine and Lopressor. A decision was made
not to introduce an ACE inhibitor at this time given her recent
_____ and her baseline renal insufficiency ( 1.8-1.9 ). The
addition of an ACE inhibitor may be indicated at some point in
the near future.
DISCHARGE PLAN:
The patient will be discharged to Mitent Health
Hospital.
FOLLOW UP PLANS:
The patient will see her primary care physician , Marco Kenouo ,
at the Department of Medicine on 9/26/04. She will see Dr.
Doyle Ghamdi of Neurology on 2/12/03 at 4 p.m. She will see Dr.
Toney Montagna at the Department of Cardiology on 10/4/04.

6 ) h/o asthma per pt; 7 ) depression; 8 ) fibromyalgia; 9 ) gout; 10 )
gastritis/DU; 11 ) s/p ventral hernia repair. Now , pt described
subacute chest/neck diffuse discomfort and episodic SOB possibly worse
w/ exertion though not clearly related to activity , breathing , meals ,
position , nitro and w/o further associated sxs. Notes medication
non-adherence at times due to depression and not re-filling meds;
includes no lasix x3+ weeks. Seen by PCP w/ SaO2 noted to be 91% on RA
( on home O2 prior but not currently for e/o PNA ) -> admitted.
Overall , evaluated for dyspnea w/ neck/chest discomfort & hyoxemia of
unclear etiology. Performed ABG to confirm hypoxemia: on 3L NC
7.45/45/79 ( Aa gradient elevated at approximately 158 ).
- Suspected DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION in context of ischemic heart dz/HTN
w/ exacerbation due to med compliance including no recent lasix. This
supported by a ) mild improvement w/ diuresis w/ lasix 40 IV qd
w/ resting & ambulatory SaO2s > 93% on 2L and resting SaO2 >90% ( though
decreased to 87% w/ ambulation ) at time of discharge; b ) underlying
CAD/HTN; c ) repeat TTE w/ low E/A suggestive of diastolic dyfxn; d )
crackles though no elevated JVD. However admission BNP=102 & still
some hypoxemia at DC & unclear crackles despite diuresis suggesting
additional process:
- PFTs suggest RVD ( ? obesity/CHF v other ); A-mibi w/o e/o active
ischemia; CXR/CT not suggestive of interstitial
abnormality/thromboembolic dz/PNA; episode of panic w/ more dypnea
possibly further explaining SOB though not hypoxemia. Outpt
consideration of full PFTS , OSA screen , screen for shunt ( not pursued
given correction w/ supplemental O2 )
- pt to follow w/ a ) pulm to see if possible ILD/other despite nl
CT given RVD/hypoxia/RA & consider full PFTs including lung volumes &
consider contribution of possible OSA/hypoventilation; b ) CHF clinic
( discharge weight = 186.4 though no relaible weights established ); c )
PCP; d ) psychiatry to enhance mood and med adherence. Established w/
home O2 transiently at 2L given borderline hypoxemia w/ ambulation on
RA and much improved sxs.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please note that we have intended to make NO changes in your
medications , in case you note any discrepanices , with the following
exception: we increased lisiniopril to 5 mg once a day. It is critical
that you take your medications , including the lasix - seek help from
your pharmacists/primary providers if needed as arrangements including
pill packs may be arranged. It is also critical that you see your
outpatient providers as outlined for continued evaluation though seek
medical attention immediately if you develop anything of concern.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
Consider full PFTS , screen for sleep apnea , adjustment of diuresis
regimen , and TTE w/ bubble if no improvement ,

ADDENDUM
Please note this is an addendum to the previously dictated
discharge summary #6047544.
INTERIM HISTORY: In the interim , since the previously dictated
discharge summary , the patient has continued to progress from a
cardiac standpoint.
HOSPITAL COURSE: His hospital course by system from 10/25/05
through the date of discharge is as follows:
1. Ischemia: The patient had continued to remain stable from an
ischemia standpoint. He continues on aspirin and statin. A
beta-blocker has been added back to his regimen and was titrated
to a dose of Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. The patient has not
been started on an ACE inhibitor secondary to his elevated
creatinine at this time. He has had no further episodes of chest
pain.
2. Pump: The patient's congestive heart failure regimen was
titrated. The patient continues on Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. and
hydralazine 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. for after load reduction. He was
restarted on a low-dose beta-blocker at 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. as
well as digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d. The patient was
aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix and Zaroxolyn
followed by conversion to oral diuresis with torsemide at the
time of discharge. The patient will be followed by Dr. Rayford Hogenmiller in the Clevesa Irvca Sideenandri as well as by the
CHF Service at Sher-ship Rimark's Medical Center . At the time of
discharge , the patient was felt to be nearing euvolemia with
estimated dry weight of approximately 76 to 77 kg.
3. Rhythm: The patient continued to have atrial flutter with a
block. His heart rate remained in the rate of 100 to 110 at the
time of discharge. He had decreased episodes of more rapid
dysrhythmia following addition of beta-blocker and digoxin to his
medication regimen. He also continues on amiodarone at 200 mg
p.o. q.d. As mentioned , the patient was found to have atrial
clot on transesophageal echocardiogram and thus was started on a
heparin drip and transitioned on Coumadin. However , after a
substantial discussion with the Congestive Heart Failure Service
and the patient's outpatient CHF Care Team , it was felt that the
risks of Coumadin in this patient who has a history of
significant noncompliance were greater than the known risk of
thromboembolic disease in the setting of his known atrial clot
and thus the patient was not continued on Coumadin
anticoagulation. Rather , he was given aspirin and Plavix at full
doses. The use of Coumadin in this patient could be re-evaluated
as an outpatient based on the patient's follow-up as deemed
appropriate by his outpatient providers.
4. Endocrine: The patient remained on stable diabetes mellitus
regimen of Lantus 5 units q.p.m. and standing NovoLog 3 units
q.a.c. as well as the NovoLog sliding scale. The patient's
insulin regimen can be adjusted as an outpatient and possibly
oral diabetes medications restarted.
5. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from the pulmonary
with good oxygen saturations on room air at rest and with
ambulation.
6. Renal: The patient's creatinine on the day prior to
discharge was 1.6 improved from the peak of greater than 2.
Renal toxic medications were avoided. The patient had not been
restarted on ACE inhibitor , which could be done as an outpatient
as his renal function stabilizes. His electrolytes were
monitored and repleted aggressively.
7. Hematology: As mentioned , the decision was made not to
anticoagulate the patient with outpatient Coumadin. He was
started on aspirin and Plavix. Of note , the patient also had
decreased platelets in the setting of heparin anticoagulation and
thus anti-P4 antibody was sent. This test is pending at the time
of the dictation , but should be followed up by the patient's
outpatient providers as it may input further treatment. In the
meantime , recommend no heparin products. As mentioned , the
decision was made by the CHF Team who will be following the
patient as an outpatient not to continue Coumadin
anticoagulation.
8. Neuro: Of note , on the evening of 5/2/05 , the patient
complained of left-sided blurry vision , which was new for the
patient. He does have chronic right visual changes. In light of
the patient's known peripheral atherosclerotic disease and atrial
clot , the patient was seen by the Stroke Team for a question of
acute stroke. He had MRI at that time , which did show multiple
old infarcts in the right frontal , right occipital , left
occipitoparietal , left posterior frontal areas. There was ,
however , no new stroke seen on the MRI. The left internal
carotid artery was not evaluated , not visualized on the MRI and
there was concern for left carotid artery occlusion versus
stenosis. The patient declined any procedure such as carotid
endarterectomy or carotid stenting for his possible carotid
stenosis and due to this denial no workup with the CTA was done.
It was felt that because the patient would decline any
intervention the risk of contrast in the setting of his acute
renal insufficiency would outweigh the benefits of the study.
The patient declined any intervention for his carotid arteries on
several occasions. A carotid noninvasives were ordered and are
pending at the time of this dictation to evaluate the severity of
disease.
9. Social: The patient's sister , Alexis Fernendez , is his health care
proxy. The patient in her presence has declined coronary artery
bypass grafting and heart transplant evaluation. The patient has
also declined further procedure for his probable carotid artery
stenosis.
10. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to the Com Medical Center for further rehabilitation. He will follow up with Dr.
Kyle Yandle in the T Las on 8/23/05 at 08:30 a.m. as well
as with Dr. Clyde Chatampaya of Elmert Hospital
Cardiology 10/25/05. He also has a follow-up appointment with
TRISTONTERN MEDICAL CENTER PCP , Raymond Banaag , on 8/26/05 at 01:50 p.m. The patient
requires substantial social support at this time , which is being
provided by his sister.

The patient received care on the Stockvi
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Dilated cardiomyopathy with associated
problems of hypertension and asthma.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: This is a 53 year old female with hypertension x
eight years , who presents with increased dyspnea
on exertion and admitted for left and right heart catheterization ,
and to optimize blood pressure control.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 53 year old Afro-American
female , first diagnosed with
hypertension in 1987. She presented to the Emergency Room in 1987
with acute atypical chest pain , and was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. ETT in 1987 demonstrated chest pain during exercise
and suggestive ST T wave changes in the inferolateral leads during
exercise. The patient was discharged from the hospital , and did
relatively well with intermittent chest pain on exertion.
Exercise tolerance test in 1991 demonstrated consistent , but not
diagnostic of ischemia. No chest pain. Echocardiogram in 1992
demonstrated inferior , posterior , and apical hyperkinesis , low to
normal global pattern of systolic contractile function , and a
celionous redundancy of the mitral anterior leaflet , with only
trace mitral regurgitation.
Since 1992 , the patient has developed severe shortness of breath
with positive chest discomfort of pin and needles in the left
chest , which radiates down her left arm. She notes positive
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with the need of sleeping elevated at
45 degrees at some times.
Echocardiogram in 1994 demonstrated moderately dilated left
ventricle with severely depressed systolic function. Ejection
fraction equals 26%. There was 2+ mitral regurgitation and mild
left atrial enlargement also noted. Mild tricuspid regurgitation
with pulmonary artery pressure estimated at approximately 25.
Due to her hypertension and decreased left ventricular function ,
the patient presents to the Ton Medical Center for a left
and right side catheterization , and also for monitoring of her
blood pressure. Her blood pressure ranged , as an outpatient ,
between 170 to 180/100 to 110.

ATTENDING: LEGGET , BASIL MALCOM MD
Admitted 10/18/05 to Dr. Alan Smaniotto
ADMISSION CHIEF COMPLAINT: Poor p.o. intake and failure to
thrive.
HPI: This 77-year-old female first noted dysphagia beginning in
approximately October 2005. Since then it has persisted and
worsened , and she was seen by a primary care physician. Initial
endoscopy was performed , which was suspicious for malignancy ,
however , the patient was on Coumadin and no biopsy was obtained
at that time. She underwent a repeat upper endoscopy on August ,
2005 at the Arma Healthcare Health The EGD revealed that Ms. Hinrichsen
had Barrett's esophagus as well as a nodule on the distal
esophagus. No evidence of gastritis. A biopsy of the nodule
revealed poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma at 35 cm.
It appeared to be rising in association with Barrett's
esophagitis. She also has a history of ischemic myopathy with an
LVEF of approximately 20% and CAD with a history of bypass graft
in 1992 and a biventricular ICD placed in October 2004. She
underwent an endoscopy on September , 2005 , an EUS revealed that she
had an intramural lesion in the distal esophagus measuring 2 cm
in diameter invading into the muscularis propria , therefore she
was staged and having T3 , N0 , MX , and tumor by EUS. She was seen
at Toards Health in mid July by both Dr. Tyrell Aningalan
from Medial Oncology and Dr. Wahlen from Radiation Oncology. It was
felt that she was a reasonable candidate for consideration of
chemoradiation. She therefore began her chemoradiation and
radiotherapy , chemotherapy including Taxol and cisplatin.
Approximately 1 week prior to admission on February , 2005 ,
unfortunately , she reports over the course of the past week , she
has had increasing dysphagia to the point where she is having
trouble swallowing liquids. She presented for her routine
radiation therapy the day prior to admission , with complaints of
severe lightheadedness and difficulty getting off the radiation
table. She was taken to the ED , where she was found to be
dehydrated and weak. She had some chills , but no fever , no
hemoptysis or diarrhea. She has had very poor p.o. intake and
she notes some weight loss.

10. Hypothyroidism.
11. Peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES: Codeine causes GI upset , morphine and Demerol caused
GI upset , amoxicillin/clavulanic acid caused GI upset , azelastine
causes stinging , and amiodarone causes cold sweats.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications on admission were Lopressor 50
b.i.d. , Diovan 80 , digoxin 0.125 mg five days a week , Synthroid
0.125 mg , Imdur 30 daily , Lasix 80 daily , Prevacid 30 daily ,

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives with her
husband. She is a homemaker. She does not smoke. She does not
drink except for occasionally.
FAMILY HISTORY: She has a father with melanoma , and a mother
with an MI at the age of 59.
REVIEW OF SYSTEM: She had no abdominal pain , no chest pain , no
shortness of breath , no headache , and no joint pain.
PHYSICAL EXAM: On admission ,
VITAL SIGNS: Her temp was 97.4 , pulse 86 , blood pressure 87/56 ,
respiratory rate 20 , saturating 98% on room air.
GENERAL: She was an alert , oriented , cooperative female , who was
resting comfortably.
HEENT: Her mucous membranes were dry , oropharynx clear. Pupils
were equal , round and reactive to right. Extraocular motions
intact.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no crackles or
wheezes.
NECK: There is JVP at 7 cm , low lymphadenopathy. Her neck was
supple.
CARDIOVASCULAR: She was irregularly regular with a 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur loudest at the apex.
ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , with positive bowel
sounds. Her extremities had trace edema with no bruising.
LABORATORY DATA: Her admission labs were notable for potassium
of 2.9 , BUN of 37 and creatinine of 1.6. Her LFTs and CBC were
within normal limits. Her INR on admission was 2.7. Her albumin
was 3.7 , mag 1.5. Her UA was negative. Her EKG showed a right
bundle branch block with A-fib , A-flutter with occasional paced
beats from her pacer. Her chest x-ray was clear.
ASSESSMENT: This 77-year-old female with a history of CAD , CHF
and esophageal cancer presenting with lightheadedness , however ,
having nausea and vomiting , most likely her symptoms are due to
dehydration. Unlikely a cardiac cause given no chest pain , no
palpitation , and obviously decreased p.o.
PLAN:
1. Lightheadedness: Poor p.o. intake and dehydration.
Nutrition was consulted to evaluate regarding the possible stent
in esophagus. She will be treated with gentle hydration
overnight , measure orthostatics , holding Lasix.
2. Cardiovascular: History of CHF with an EF of 20% , checking
BNP and monitor on tele for arrhythmia , continue digoxin , Diovan ,
Lopressor , continue Imdur , continue Lasix while hydrating.
3. Esophageal Cancer: Got XRT. On the day of admission , she
will continue XRT.
4. Nausea: Rx for Zofran and replete potassium.
5. Hypothyroidism: Continue Synthroid.
6. GERD: Continue Prevacid.
7. A-fib: Continue Coumadin.
8. Hyperlipidemia: Continue Zocor.
9. FEN: Replete electrolytes p.r.n. , diabetic diet , and
multivitamin.
10. Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin and Prevacid.
11. Full code.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Lightheadedness: It was felt that all of her lightheadedness
was most likely due to dehydration. Her lightheadedness improved
with hydration , it was most likely due to poor p.o. intake.
Nutrition evaluated her and suggested high calorie supplements ,
however , she continued to be nauseated and unable to take good
p.o. GI was consulted regarding possible stenting of her
esophagus given that she had an intra-esophageal lesion that
could potentially be causing this nausea. She was also ordered
for a barium swallow. On the barium swallow , there was a strict
stenotic lesion of the esophagus , which is not allowed any food
to pass through. An EGD was performed , which showed some food
about a tight stenosis that was unable to be passed. Based upon
this it was felt that she would benefit from a G-tube.
Interventional radiology was consulted and placed a G-tube
without complication. Tube feeds were begun and she tolerated
them well without complication. She has been continued on tube
feeds and is currently at goal of 360 cc four times a day , with a
scoop of promod , these will be continued upon discharge.
2. TIA/CVA: On the evening of 5/24/05 , it was noted that she
had decreased ability to move the left side of her body. Based
upon this , a STAT CT and CTA was performed. The CT showed no
bleeding , and during the CT scan , she regained all function in
the left side , however , the CTA did note a large friable clot
within her right ICA. Based upon her high level of heart disease
and high risk for an operative procedure , it was not felt that
she would be a stent candidate at that time. She was continued
on Lovenox therapy with Coumadin with the plan to discharge her
on medical management for this TIA. However , on the morning of
8/16/05 , she was noted to have a new left-sided facial droop.
She also had some left-sided weakness. A STAT CT , CTA once again
showed no bleed. At this point , the clot was noted to have moved
from the right ICA into the MCA , and to have dissolved somewhat.
Based upon this , it felt that she would have good recovery from
her stroke , and she was not a candidate for any sort of
intervention at that time. She was converted over to heparin
drip with the plan to give her a heparin drip as bridging over
while her Coumadin became therapeutic. She was continued on
heparin drip until her INR was therapeutic. She will be
discharged on Coumadin and continued on Coumadin and aspirin
therapy for life.
3. Esophageal Cancer: She was continued on XRT for the entire
time when she was in the hospital. Conversations between Dr.
Depaoli , Dr. Serl and the family were had and it was felt that she
was no longer a chemotherapy candidate given her poor status , in
terms of her other issues. She will be continued on XRT after
discharge from the hospital.
4. Acute Renal Failure: On admission , she was noted to have an
increased creatinine; it was felt to be most likely due to
dehydration. However , at the time of admission , she had a BUN of
50% and a renal ultrasound was performed , the renal ultrasound
was normal and showed no further defect over the course of her
hospital stay. Her creatinine continued trending down and was
0.9 on the day prior to discharge.
5. CAD: She has a history of CHF with an EF of 50%. She was
monitored on tele for arrhythmia and no arrhythmia was observed.
She does of note have a right bundle branch block at baseline as
well as biventricular pacer with 1 lead out of place causing a
wide complex rhythm. There were multiple alarms for VT , which
were simply her baseline rhythm. In the hospital , she was
continued on digoxin , Lopressor , and Imdur. Her Lasix was
initially held , while she was being hydrated , however , it was
restarted after the G-tube was placed and she was getting
sufficient feeds. She was also continued on her statin. She had
no other cardiac issues while she was in the hospital.
6. Nausea: She was treated with Zofran for her nausea when she
was admitted and she continued to have good response to this.
7. Urinary Tract Infection: On the 25 of May she noted that she was
having increasing pain on urination and increasing burning , an UA
was done and it was found to be positive for infection. A
culture was performed , which showed enterobacter that was
levo-sensitive. She was started on Levaquin and the Foley , which
had been placed prior was discontinued. She was continued on
Levaquin for a 10-day course and this will be continued for
several days after discharge.
8. Hypothyroidism: She was continued on her Synthroid at her
home dosages while she was in-house.
9. GERD: She was continued on Prevacid while she was in-house.
10. A-fib: She was continued on Coumadin , although it was held
prior to her EGD and G-tube placement. During the time when she
was not therapeutic on her Coumadin she was treated with either
Lovenox subcu. or heparin IV drip titrated to a PTT of 60 to 80 ,
therefore she was always therapeutic on her anticoagulin during
this hospital stay.
11. She was initially on a full diet , however , she was unable to
take any p.o. so she was started on tube feeds , which she was
able to make her goal. Nutrition was involved in her care and
she was continued on multivitamin.
12. She was on Lovenox or heparin drip throughout her
hospitalization for DVT prophylaxis. She was also continued on
Prevacid.
CODE STATUS: Full Code , and remained full code throughout her
hospitalization.
COMMUNICATION: There was much communication between her family
throughout this hospitalization in terms of their wishes for her
care and for her discharge , and it was agreed that a rehab would
be a good place for to go at the end of her stay here.

Discharge Date: 11/1/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Ainsley is a 60-year-old woman with
a history of insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and congestive heart
failure who presented in February of 2001 with pain in the left
lateral aspect of her fifth metatarsophalangeal area without
bleeding. This wound has failed to heal over time.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus times
20 years , obesity , hypertension , depression ,
sleep apnea.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 8/23/94 incision and drainage and
debridement of abdominal wound. 4/6/94 ,
debridement of abdominal wound. 10/26/94 debridement and closure
of abdominal wound. 1/7/96 debridement of a chronically infected
abdominal wound in the right lower quadrant. 4/5/97 debridement
of nonhealing abdominal wound in the right lower quadrant. Ventral
hernia repair and abdominoplasty in 4/27/97. 8/1/97 drainage of
seroma with wound debridement and closure. The patient has also
had an appendectomy in 1994 , cholecystectomy and ventral hernia
repair.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q day , Neurontin 600 mg
p.o. q day , Prozac 40 mg p.o. q day , Prilosec
20 mg p.o. q day , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day , Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q
day , Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q day and magnesium supplementation of an
unknown quantity.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Weight 315 pounds , blood pressure 130/70 , pulse 68 ,
respiratory rate 18. GENERAL: She was an obese ,
age appropriate elderly female. HEENT: Extraocular movements
intact. No jugular venous distention and no bruits. HEART: With
a clear distinct S1 and S2. Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs ,
rubs or gallops. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation with no wheezes ,
rales or rhonchi. ABDOMEN: Obese , nontender , nondistended with
normal active bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. EXTREMITIES:
Demonstrated no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. She had radial pulses
2 plus right and 2 plus at the left. Femoral pulses 1 plus
bilaterally. Popliteal pulses 1 plus bilaterally. Dorsalis pedis
pulse was biphasic and so was the posterior tibialis bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the manic vascular
surgery service and she underwent an
uncomplicated debridement of the nonhealing ulcer on the left
lateral aspect of her left forefoot. The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was stable in the immediate postoperative
period. The patient was then transferred to the floor where she
underwent a rapid progressive and uncomplicated course of recovery.
The patient's hospital stay was protracted due to inability of the
patient to mobilize herself with the assistance of physical
therapy. She was screened for rehabilitation placement at this
time but there was some difficulty in placement secondary to bed
non-availability. This immobility is consistent with her
mobilization ambulatory capacity at home as per her own report.
The patient throughout the remainder of her hospital stay had
continued progressive healing of the wound on the lateral aspect of
her left forefoot with wet-to-dry dressing changes. Her finger
stick blood sugars were well controlled. By postoperative day
number seven , June , 2001 the patient was found to have
minimal pain , to be voiding and moving her bowels with ease , to be
ambulating with assistance from physical therapy and a walker , to
demonstrate continued well healing of the ulcer at the lateral
aspect of the left forefoot. She was satting well on room air and
tolerating a diabetic house diet.
A placement in a rehabilitation facility was found and the patient
was discharged to rehabilitation with appropriate follow up and
discharge instructions.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally with no wheezes , rales or
rhonchi. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs , rubs or
gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , obese , nontender , nondistended. Normal
active bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Pulses at the foot which are
biphasic at the dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibialis
bilaterally. The ulcer at the lateral aspect of her left forefoot
was well healing and approximately 0.75 cm in diameter with a well
developed bed of granulation tissue.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4h p.r.n. pain ,
headaches or temperature greater than
101.0 , Prozac 40 mg q day , NPH insulin 60 units q a.m. and 40 units
q p.m. subcutaneously , insulin regular sliding scale subcutaneously
q.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q day , oxycodone 5 mg p.o. q 4 hours
p.r.n. pain , Senna tablets p.o. b.i.d. , Trazodone 50 mg p.o.

Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q day , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day.
REMAINING ISSUES: Primarily mobilization. The patient should be
seen by physical therapy to expand her
ambulatory and mobilization capacity. Her wound should be cared
for with wet-to-dry dressing changes twice per day and she should
follow up with Dr. Aljemal in 7-10 days.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypertension.
2. Anemia.
3. Congestive heart failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73 year old male who
was in his usual state of health until
approximately one to two weeks prior to admission , when the patient
had his antihypertensive medications changed. His nifedipine was
discontinued because of gingival hypertrophy and Atenolol was
replaced. Shortly after that he developed increased dyspnea on
exertion , shortness of breath , especially with walking in the
morning. There was a question of light-headedness. He denied any
chest pain , pressure , or tightness. No jaw , neck or arm symptoms.
No orthopnea or PND. Her also denied visual symptoms or headache.
One day prior to admission the patient was taking a walk and was so
fatigued that he had to stop. On the day of admission the patient
was again taking a walk and was noted by friends to be somewhat
unsteady and diaphoretic. The EMTs were called. The patient was
given Lasix and nitroglycerin with improvement in his symptoms. He
denies cough , fevers , chills , vomiting , melena or hematochezia.
The patient has been taking all of his prescribed medications. No
dietary changes. He notes good appetite , no early satiety. He has
a history of two syncopal episodes in the distant past. On the
morning of the admission the patient has not taken any of his
medications yet.

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient quit smoking tobacco approximately 40
years ago. Occasional alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: His brother had a heart attack in his late 50s.
The brother also has diabetes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98 , blood pressure
190/98 , pulse 48. O2 saturation was 98% on
two liters by nasal cannula. GENERAL: The patient is an elderly
African-American gentleman , sitting up in bed in no acute distress ,
talking in complete sentences. HEENT: The left eye has a
nonreactive pupil. The right eye has a small pupil , approximately
2 mm , with a clear cataract. There is no icterus. The oropharynx
was clear with gingival hypertrophy. NECK: Supple , with full
range of motion. There was no lymphadenopathy. JVP was difficult
to assess because of the large neck. CARDIAC: Regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the base. The carotids were
without bruits. PULMONARY: The patient had bibasilar rales with
expiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase. ABDOMEN:
Protuberant , soft , non-tender. Normoactive bowel sounds. No
organs appreciated. EXTREMITIES: Edema 2+. Femoral pulses were
2+. There were bruits. Distal pulses were intact. RECTAL: The
patient was heme-negative.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Sodium 143 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 104 ,
bicarbonate 24 , BUN 35 , creatinine 2.0 ,
glucose 144. CBC shows WBC 8 , hematocrit 32.9 , platelets 343 , MCV
approximately 80 , RDW approximately 16. Admission CK was 175.
Troponin I was 0.05. Chest x-ray showed a questionable bibasilar
infiltrates. EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 56. The axis was 20
degrees. The intervals were 0.175/10/96/0.471. There was LVH by
voltage criteria , an isolated Q in lead 3 , biphasic T waves in AVL ,
and a flat T in lead 3.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By problems:
Congestive heart failure: The patient underwent a rule out
myocardial infarction protocol and subsequently did rule out.
After that he had an exercise echo. The patient exercised for
three minutes on a modified Bruce , achieving a maximum heart rate
of 97 and a blood pressure of 160. The test was stopped because of
knee pain and shortness of breath. Baseline images prior to
exercise showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy , with overall
normal function. There were no resting wall motion abnormalities.
Stress images obtained after peak exercise showed a suggestion of a
posterobasilar hypokinesis. No other wall motion abnormalities
were noted. It was felt that this findings were questionable for
nonspecific finding or ischemia. It was felt that the EKG portion
of the ETT showed no evidence for ischemia. The patient was
diuresed gently with IV Lasix and his shortness of breath improved.
Hypertension: On admission , the patient's blood pressure was
approximately 220/110. The patient was started on IV nitroglycerin
and IV Labetalol in the Emergency Department. The patient was
subsequently weaned from IV nitroglycerin and switched to p.o.
hydralazine and minoxidil , 100 mg t.i.d. and 2.5 mg q d. ,
respectively. The patient had excellent blood pressure control on
these medications. The patient was discharged with close follow-up
in order to titrate these medications.
Anemia: The patient's admission hematocrit was 32.2. Subsequent
hematocrits were very labile , and there was felt to be some lab
error involved. Follow-up hematocrit was in the mid 20s. This was
repeated and was again in the mid 20s. He was transfused two units
of packed red blood cells and underwent upper endoscopy. The
findings were gastritis , with some small erosions in the antrum and
a subcutaneous nodules , which was biopsied. H. pylori studies were
pending at discharge , as were biopsy results. The patient was
started on Prilosec 20 mg q d. and will continue with this for
several weeks. Aspirin was held , as the patient's EGD findings
were felt to be consistent with NSAID gastritis. Iron studies
obtained were not entirely consistent with iron deficient anemia.
The serum iron was low. However , the ferritin and TIBC were within
the normal range. Further workup of the patient's anemia will take
place as an outpatient.
Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine increased
from admission value of 2.0 to 2.5. This was felt to be secondary
to diuresis , and the patient's diuretic dose was decreased. The
patient will need to have outpatient follow-up of his creatinine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 97.8 , heart rate
80 , blood pressure 91/52 , respirations 18 , and satting 95% on 6
liters of nasal cannula. The patient was noted to be lethargic
but otherwise had no acute distress. He was oriented to person
and place. Lungs examination revealed a few basilar crackles ,
but otherwise was clear. Cardiac examination had a regular rate
and rhythm with 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at left sternal
border nonradiating. Abdomen was unremarkable. His right knee
had a large effusion with erythema , tenderness to palpation , and
limited range of motion.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for a sodium of 132; a
potassium of 5.1; and a creatinine of 4.0 , up from a baseline of
1.5. White count was 11 , hematocrit was 37.6 , and platelets were
217. Lactic acid was 0.8. Troponin was 0.71. LFTs were within
normal limits.
DIAGNOSTIC DATA: Chest x-ray revealed poor inspiratory effort
and question of left lingular infiltrate , mild pulmonary edema ,
and a calcified left anterior descending artery. EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm with incomplete right-bundle branch block , 2
to 3 mm SCD depression in the V3 through V5.
Micro from January , 2005 , Staphylococcus aureus with
sensitivities pending. Blood cultures form January , 2005 ,
Gram-positive cocci , speciation and sensitivities pending.
IMPRESSION: This is an 82-year-old gentleman with septic shock
likely secondary to infection of his right prosthetic knee
complicated by bacteremia , acute renal failure , myocardial
injury , and mental status changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Infectious Disease. The patient was found to have MRSA ,
septic arthritis complicated by septic shock , bacteremia and
acute renal failure. He was brought to the operating room with
removal of his prosthetic knee and debridement of his surrounding
area with drain replacement. He was started on a 42-day course
of vancomycin 1 g q.12h. and is currently on day #18 as of
February , 2005. He was also noted to have pneumonia on the
left side that bronchoscopy was also thought to be MRSA
pneumonia. Per ID consult , he was started the linezolid for
better lung penetration and is currently on day #8 of 14. He has
been afebrile now with negative cultures since then. Of note , on
bronchoscopy , there was cytopathic changes consistent with HSV
infection , and he was treated with a course of acyclovir also per
infectious disease this is probably unnecessary and presented
contamination from an old lesion.
2. Pulmonary. The patient had a nosocomial pneumonia with MRSA
and was intubated for inability to handle secretions and mental
status changes. He had a tracheostomy placed and has been
tolerating that breathing on trach collar during the day and
resting on pressure support of 5 and 5 overnight. BBG are
followed with a PC02 goal of less than 55 and a pH of greater
than 7.30 when these were correlated to his arterial blood gas.
3. Cardiovascular. The patient was noted to be in distributive
shock on Neo-Synephrine with a troponin leak secondary to demand
physiology. He had an echo performed , which demonstrated
diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction. He also
had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response in the setting of an acute septic shock. He is
currently in normal sinus rhythm with cardiac enzymes having
resolved. He has been maintained on aspirin , Lipitor , and
Lopressor for blood pressure and rate control.
4. Renal. The patient was noted to be in acute renal failure ,
which is now resolved and with a creatinine at back to baseline
of 1.2 to 1.5.
5. Hematology. The patient has anemia of chronic disease with
crit at baseline of 30. He should be transfused for transfusion
goal of 26 , although there has been no evidence of acute blood
loss during his hospital course other than perioperative excepted
acute drop in crit which is now resolved.
6. Endocrine. The patient was on 50 units of Lantus as an
outpatient but did have episodes of hypoglycemia in the setting
of sepsis and poor nutritional status. He is currently on Lantus
20 units , which can be slowly increased if his blood sugars are
running high. Additional glucose management can be maintained
with sliding scale insulin.
7. Pain/Psych. The patient had peristent delirium likely the
combination of infection pain , ICU delirium , and treatment with
Versed and fentanyl. He had a head CT , which was negative for
any acute process , and once his intravenous narcotic and
benzodiazepine were stopped , his delirium rapidly cleared over 24
to 48 hours. The patient is now on a fentanyl patch for pain
control , which can be increased as his sensorium clears and
Haldol was effective for agitation as well.
8. Gastrointestinal/FEN. The patient had PEG placement to
supplement nutrition and has been tolerating tube feeds without
difficulty.
9. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on Nexium and
subcutaneous Lovenox.
10. Code Status. The patient is full code.

ATTENDING: STOMBERG , MARLON MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
The patient is admitted for a right gluteal hematoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with coronary artery disease
status post recent bare metal stenting in August ,
hypercholesterolemia , CLL and peripheral arterial disease and
admitted for increasing right thigh pain and falling
hematocrit at rehabilitation. The patient had a complicated
hospitalization in August where he presented with a severe
right MRSA infection of his right lower extremity. During
hospitalization , he required a revascularization prior to
undergoing surgery and had a bare metal stent placed to his left
anterior descending artery. After his stenting , he underwent a left BKA to
eradicate his left lower
extremity infection and was later noted to have a
right upper extremity clot associated with central venous catheter. The
patient was discharged from the hospital in August on Lovenox
80 mg twice daily and on Coumadin with the plan that his Lovenox
be stopped at the time of his Coumadin reaching a therapeutic
level. He was also discharged on aspirin and Plavix for his bare
metal stent. On the day prior to admission , the patient was
noted to have a hematocrit of 24 at rehab and on the day of
admission the Hct rechecked and was found to be 18. For this , he was
transferred to the Landm Hospital for further
workup. The patient denies any blood in the stool , melena ,
dizziness or lightheadedness. He does note some pain on his
right side , particularly his right upper thigh and gluteal
area. He denies any recent trauma. He felt some weakness in his
right leg but has had no paresthesias or pain. He states that
his leg has been at all times warm.
ED COURSE:
The patient was noted to be guaiac negative and complained of
some mild abdominal fullness. He received an abdominal CT , which
showed a very large right gluteal hematoma with a fresh fluid
levels suggesting acute bleed. The patient was given packed red
blood cells and was noted to have a potassium level of 5.8 for
which he received Kayexalate.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Type II diabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease status
post MI in 1997. He had a nonST elevation MI in 3/29 for
which he underwent catheterization. Catheterization at that time
showed an 80% left anterior descending lesion , which was stented
to 0 with a bare metal stent , 80% diagonal and first diagonal
lesion and a 100% circumflex lesion. The patient has known
significant peripheral vascular disease status post left TMA in
4/3 with fem-pop in 4/3 , left foot debridement in 5/26
and finally a left BKA in 6/26 He has congestive heart
failure with last ejection fraction of 32% , hyperlipidemia , gout ,
CLL status post fludarabine x4 cycles in 2004 in which has been
stable with no evidence of residual or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy , BPH , chronic kidney disease with a baseline
creatinine of 2.5 , and glaucoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
The patient was in no acute distress. Normocephalic , atraumatic.
His eyes were anicteric. His extraocular membranes were intact.
Mucous membranes were moist without exudates. His neck was
supple , with full range of motion. He had 2+ carotid pulses on
both sides without any evidence of bruits. His jugular venous
pressure was approximately 8 cm of water at 30 degrees of
elevation. His lungs were notable for bibasilar crackles with
left side greater than right. Cardiovascular exam: He had
regular sinus rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , and he had a I/VI
systolic ejection murmur at his base. This seemed to radiate to
his axilla. His abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended.
He had normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants , no
hepatosplenomegaly or masses. His extremities are notable for a
right-sided gluteal hematoma with fullness and thickening. He
does have 1+ palpable DP pulse on that side confirmed with
Doppler. Skin was without rash , ecchymosis , or petechiae. His
neurological exam was intact. He was alert and oriented x3.
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact. He had intact
motor and sensation in his right lower extremity along with ,
however , was noted to have a baseline neuropathy with sensory
loss up to his admission.
Admission EKG is normal for normal sinus rhythm , normal axis , old
T-wave inversions in I and aVL and an isolated ST elevation in
lead 2.
Notable studies during this admission included CT of the abdomen
on admission which showed a new right gluteal hematoma with fluid
levels suggesting acute bleed.
ADMISSION LABS:
Potassium 5.8 , creatinine 2.1 , hematocrit of 22.3. He had an MRI
of his brain done on 5/29/06 which showed subacute infarction on
the right anterior internal capsule and chronic occlusion of the
left internal carotid and old left parietal stroke. He had an
echocardiogram done on 10/1/06 with an ejection fraction of
30-35% , trace aortic insufficiency , trace mitral regurgitation ,
trace tricuspid regurgitation and PA systolic pressures of 33+
right atrial pressure.
IMPRESSION:
This is a 62-year-old man admitted for a falling hematocrit with
an evolving right gluteal hematoma secondary to supratherapeutic
anticoagulation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM IS AS FOLLOWS:
1. Right gluteal hematoma. The patient was admitted for low
hematocrit in the setting of being on multiple anticoagulant and
antiplatelet drugs. He was found to have right gluteal hematoma
which was responsible for his acute hematocrit drop. His
Coumadin , Lovenox , aspirin , and Plavix were initially held. He
received vitamin K and three units of FFP to reverse his
coagulopathy. He was also transfused a total of 6 units of PRBCs
for a goal hematocrit of 30 given his cardiac and neurologic
disease as described below. There was no evidence of further
hematocrit drop. Given that he had been anticoagulated due to
right upper extremity DVT and that the indication for
anticoagulation in the setting and catheter associated clot is
somewhat murky , it was felt that the patient would not benefit
from addition of anticoagulation and therefore his Lovenox and
Coumadin were discontinued. He was restarted on his aspirin and
and his Plavix and his Hct remained stable.
2. Non-ST-elevation MI. The patient was admitted in August
and was known to have three-vessel coronary disease and had
underwent stenting of his LAD with a bare metal stent on
6/28/06. After discussion with the cardiologist , he was stopped
on aspirin and Plavix given the evolution of hematoma and his
acute hematocrit drop. During his lowest hematocrit period , the
patient was noted to have lateral ST depressions and this
corresponded to a troponin leak with a peak troponin of 2.46.
The etiology of this was felt to be demand related to his
profound anemia and on correction of his anemia , the patient's ST
depressions resolved fully and his troponins trended downward.
The patient was known to have a presumed ischemic cardiomyopathy
following his nonST elevation MI. He was found to have an
ejection fraction of 30-35%. He will
need to have a repeat echocardiogram done in one month's time to
assess whether or not he would benefit from an implantable
cardiac defibrillator. The patient's blood pressure medications
were adjusted as follows. His blood pressure medications were
initially held due to his stroke-like symptoms at the time of
admission when his low hematocrit. As detailed below , however ,
they were slowly added back. He tolerated slow titration of
beta-blocker to goal heart rate and also addition of an ACE
inhibitor which was felt to be important given his extensive peripheral
vascular disease and his
low ejection fraction.
3. Recrudescence of stroke-like symptoms in the setting of the
patient's acute hematocrit drop. The patient was noted to have
worsening slurred speech and a right facial droop. He does carry
a history of left internal carotid occlusion and left-sided
stroke in the past. The Neurology team was consulted for these acute deficits
and requested an MRI. The MRI showed basically old known strokes and a
subacute right
internal capsule stroke that was felt to be unrelated to his
current symptomatology. He initially had his
antihypertensives to allow for maximal perfusion pressure. However , as
his coagulopathy resolved , it was felt that the stress that
resulted in the recrudescence of his old stroke-like symptoms was
resolved and he was able tolerate , further addition of his
antihypertensives without further incident.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was seen by physical therapy and given his recent
below the knee amputation , it was felt to be best served by going
back to rehab.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: His discharged medications are as
follows:
1. Tylenol 650 mg q.4h. p.r.n. pain.
2. Aspirin 325 mg daily.
3. Colace 100 mg twice daily.
4. Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously daily.
5. Nexium 40 mg daily.
6. Lasix 80 mg in the morning and 40 mg at night which his IO
goals should be about -500 cc of fluid per day.
7. Neurontin 100 mg b.i.d.
8. Aspart 10 units subcutaneous with meals.
9. Aspart sliding scale.
9. Glargine 42 units daily.
10. Xalatan one drop.
11. Lisinopril 15 mg daily.
12. Toprol-XL 200 mg daily.
13. Niferex 150 mg daily.
14. Zocor 40 mg at night.
15. Flomax 0.4 mg daily.
16. Multivitamin one tablet daily.
17. Zinc 220 mg daily.
18. Plavix 75 mg po daily
FOLLOW-UP PLAN:
The patient is to call his primary care physician , Dr. Lupe Bario and his cardiologist , Dr. Mraw , following
discharge from rehabilitation. At that time , he should have
repeat echocardiogram to assess his candidacy for an implantable
cardiac defibrillator.

been at an office visit on the date of admission with Dr. Rudicil
and began to experience terrible chest pain and Dr. Nacke
referred her to the Clare Taho Medical Center ED for an urgent
evaluation. In the ED , she was noted to be afebrile with a
temperature of 98 , blood pressure 91/54 , respirations 16 , and
satting 98% on 2 liters. She was noted on EKG to be in normal
sinus rhythm with 2-mm ST depressions in II , III , and aVF V4
through V6. She was given aspirin , morphine , metoprolol ,
Mucomyst , Ativan , nitroglycerin and was made pain-free and was
sent to the cath lab for the concern that her stent to the
diagonal #1 placed 6/21/04 was no longer patent , as a cause for
her unstable angina. She had been recently told that no further
intervention was possible after her stent to the diagonal #1.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease
status post CABG in 1996 , which involved LIMA to LAD ( free ) and
SVG to OM1. Peripheral vascular disease. Status post FEM-POP and
fem-fem bypass in 2003. End-stage renal disease status post
cadaveric renal transplant in 1987 , currently immunosuppressed.
IDDM , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , retinopathy , TIA , lower GI
bleed , chronic diarrhea , CMV colitis , anemia , and bladder CA ,
recent diagnosis not yet worked up.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 81 mg , azathioprine 50 mg a
day , calcium carbonate 650 mg b.i.d. , Colace 150 mg b.i.d. ,
lispro sliding scale , Lantus , multivitamin , folate , Lopressor 25
mg t.i.d. , prednisone 5 mg a day , Zocor 80 mg q.h.s. , Plavix 75
mg q. day as well as Zetia 10 mg a day.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa , Benadryl , penicillin , and Compazine.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her husband and has two children.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On admission , Ms. Ameling was taken to the
cardiac catheterization suite where it was found that her
circumflex was 60% , which had been 60% stenosis , now 100%
stenosed. Her diagonal #1 status post stent was now 100%
stenosed and all other native disease and graft disease was
unchanged. Her right heart cath revealed elevated filling
pressures and PTCA and stent was carried out of the occluded
diagonal #1 stent as well as the LAD , but she became hypotensive ,
bradycardic , and developed cardiogenic shock requiring CPR and
intubation. She had an IBP placed and subsequently an echo was
done to rule out effusion and was negative , but had an apparently
low EF. She had suspected transient decrease in flow to her
septal arteries and this likely compounded her acute myocardial
infarction. Following insertion of the intraaortic balloon pump ,
it was noted that she had absent pulses in her right foot , which
was noted also to be cool to touch. She was transferred to the
CCU , intubated and sedated , unresponsive.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her JVP was elevated. Her lungs had
coarse breath sounds anterolaterally , but without crackles or
wheezes. Her heart was regular , tachycardic with a gallop and a
3/6 harsh systolic murmur at the base of her heart and a 2/6
holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla. She had somewhat
decreased bowel sounds , but her belly was soft and nondistended.
Her bilateral lower extremities were cool with absent pulses in
her feet to palpation and her right foot was mottled and was
notably cooler without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Her CK was over 100 , MB 7 , troponin 0.92 , INR
0.9 , and platelets 191 , 000. She later developed acute renal
failure and dialysis was initiated on Monday , Wednesday , and
Friday schedule. Her echo showed an EF of 30% with severe MR as
well as inferoseptal and inferior akinesis. The balloon pump was
eventually taken out , the dopamine drip was discontinued. She
was stabilized and extubated. She was stable for several days ,
but on 9/1/04 in the evening experienced an episode of unstable
VT arrest requiring shock x 1. no further defibrillation was
needed. She stabilized after her V-TACH arrest and shocking and
per Electrophysiology Service , she was loaded with amiodarone and
has been continued on 200 mg p.o. q.6h. after being titrated off
her amiodarone drip.
BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: Ms. Quigg has terrible coronary artery disease
and no further intervention can be offered to her after
discussion with both Dr. Kohler 's Surgical team and the EP
Service. She should not undergo any further catheterizations or
revascularization. She is currently on Aspirin , Plavix ,
Lopressor , and Zocor. She was briefly on Lipitor , but this was
discontinued after a bump in her LFTs. She is not on an ACE or
an ARB secondary to her acute renal failure and at the time of
this dictation her renal function remains poor and there are no
plans to restart an ACE inhibitor or ARB.
b. Pump: Ms. Livernoche has ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe
MR and she is undergoing ultrafiltration and regularly is getting
several liters per hemodialysis session as her blood pressure
tolerates.
c. Rhythm: Ms. Mcelhiney had an episode of ischemic and unstable
ventricular tachycardia requiring shocking. Electrophysiology
evaluated her for the possibility of an AICD placement , but this
has been deferred for now and it is unlikely that she will ever
have an AICD placed , certainly not on this hospitalization. She
has been loaded with amiodarone and is currently on 800 mg a day ,
split into 200 mg q.6h. p.o. and after 10 days she should be
changed to 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. This will take place on February She initially tolerated amiodarone very poorly secondary
to nausea , so her dose was titrated up gradually.
c. Peripheral vascular disease: Ms. Fassett has extensive
peripheral vascular disease and Vascular Surgery is following her
for a likely compartment syndrome in her right calf secondary to
ischemia upon insertion of intraaortic balloon pump. She is
having the circumferences of her cath measured once or twice a
day and these have not been increasing , have in fact been
decreasing. Also , her creatinine kinase levels have been
followed as a surrogate for compartment syndrome and these have
been decreasing and are currently normal. At the time of this
dictation , her CK was 75 down from the 10 , 000 range. She was on
heparin for some time and although her cath continues to be
tender , the pain has improved and the function has gradually
returned. Her pulses remained poor. She had lower extremity
noninvasive Dopplers to evaluate her arterial venous flow and no
clot was noted in the venous circulation. There was no comment
made on the FEM-FEM graft , however , but no note was made of an
arterial clot. She should have the circumferences of her right
calf followed closely at the place that they are marked on the
right lower extremity.
2. Renal: Ms. Barrete has acute on chronic renal failure. She
was admitted with a creatinine of 2.7 and her creatinine has been
up and down depending on the timing of her dialysis; however , she
is relatively anuric , but occasionally produces small volumes of
urine and this should be followed carefully as well. She is
continuing on prednisone and azathioprine for her transplant and
she did have one positive UA , but this is not being treated
because it is difficult to assess secondary to her extremely
concentrated urine , but should be followed if she does produce
urine. This may be permanent , but it is not clear at this point
she may be on hemodialysis indefinitely. She is on fluid
restriction per renal recommendations of 1000 cc per day intake
and her ARB is being held for now.
3. ID: Ms. Helmy spiked on 11/5/04 to 101.8 and she has
been found to have a line infection with a positive triple-lumen
catheter tip as well as positive blood cultures. She was started
on vancomycin on 4/7/04 and this is being dosed according to
her vancomycin troughs , which are drawn once a day. If her
trough is near or below 15 she should be given one dose of
vancomycin and this has turned out to be approximately every
other day.
4. Heme: Ms. Kornn 's platelets have been dropping from the
100s to the mid 50s since she was started on amiodarone. It is
not clear what the source is. She has had two negative HIT
antibodies , platelet factor IV antibodies , and her platelets
seemed to have stabilized in the high 40s , mid 50s and she is not
showing any signs of acute bleed , but this has been communicated
with Electrophysiology Service who is aware of the possibility
that amiodarone may be causing her thrombocytopenia and the
amiodarone has been continued unless her thrombocytopenia worsens
significantly. She is also on a number of other medications that
may cause thrombocytopenia and these will be followed as well ,
however , it was only the amiodarone for which the timing was
coincident with the drop in her platelets.
5. Pulmonary: Ms. Wenrich has a large right pleural effusion;
it was tapped on 10/14/04 , 600 cc were removed. It was noted to
be transudative. The tap was complicated by the patient slipping
off her bed during the procedure. She was caught and did not
fall , but the pleural effusion was not completely drained and she
developed a small hydropneumothorax. This should be followed.
She also had a CT subsequently to rule out hemothorax and there
was no evidence of that. The pleural effusion is evident on her
chest x-rays with underlying consolidation. There has been no
compromise , however , in her apparent pulmonary status and this
should be followed since it will likely reaccumulate after
tapping , but if she becomes more symptomatic it should be tapped.
6. Ms. Delperdang is on prednisone. For her diabetes , she is on
NPH and an insulin sliding scale.
7. She experienced an increase in her LFTs , her transaminases
bumped to several 100s , and her total bilirubin peaked at 1.8 ,
her alkaline phosphatase also bumped , however , this may have been
secondary to the starting Lipitor and this was discontinued.
They have trended down since then. It is not clear exactly the
source of her increase in LFTs. She has been restarted on Zocor
at a very low dose at 10 mg and this should be titrated up as her
LFTs tolerate. She was on Zocor as an outpatient and we hope
that this is not a class effect and that it is not going to be
related to the dose of her Zocor.
8. GI: Her nausea should be treated with p.r.n. Ativan and
Zofran. She has a Compazine allergy.
9. Code status: Ms. Cubeta is DNR/DNI , but family does desire
that if they may help that pressures in shock can be used.

Immediately after transferring the patient to an ICU bed from the
OR table , the patient went into a VFib arrest. CPCR was briefly
performed until we could charge the external defibrillator. A
single shot of 125 joules lidocaine 60 mg resulted in sinus
rhythm and stabilization of hemodynamics. The patient was
transferred to the ICU for further postoperative care.
ICU COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Neuro: The patient received sedation as required during
intubation. After extubation , the patient was weaned off all
sedating medications and is neurologically intact upon transfer
from the unit.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was externally paced initially
postoperatively with external pacing wires and then was
transferred back to internal pacing with previously placed
device. The patient was noted to be hypotensive on postoperative
day #1 and a levophed/epinephrine drip was initiated and
titrated for appropriate blood pressures. The patient was weaned
off pressors as tolerated and by postoperative day #3 was not
requiring any IV pharmacologic intervention with her blood pressure.
The patient was placed on Lopressor perioperatively and also
received IV amiodarone for previous arrhythmia. Upon transfer ,
patient is internally rate controlled with a rate of 90 beats per
minute and stable on a dose of Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. q.i.d. as
well as amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Respiratory: The patient was weaned to extubation on
postoperative day #1 without complication. The patient is
currently stable on 2 liters nasal cannula upon transfer from the
unit.
4. The patient received perioperative IV fluids for blood
pressure maintenance. These have been weaned to off by
postoperative day #3. The patient received electrolyte
replacement as indicated. The patient has begun on diuresis of
40 mg Lasix p.o. b.i.d. upon transfer from the unit. Of note ,
creatinine is 1.3 upon discharge from the ICU which is equal to
the patient's baseline creatinine.
5. GI: The patient's diet is advanced as tolerated after
extubation and was begun on Nexium 40 mg p.o. daily.
6. Hematologic: The patient received blood transfusions as
indicated , which included 1 unit packed red blood cells on
postoperative day #1 for a hematocrit of 25 as well as 3 units of
packed blood cells on postoperative day #2. Platelet count was
noted to be below 50 on postoperative day #2 and a HIT panel was
sent which was negative x1. The patient has second HIT panel
pending upon discharge from the ICU. Platelets have been noted
to increase to 72 after nadir on postoperative day #2.
7 ID: The patient has had no issues and received appropriate
perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis vancomycin.
8. Endocrine: The patient's blood glucose was noted to be
greater than 150 postoperatively. The patient was placed on
sliding scale IV insulin per Portland protocol. The patient has
been weaned off IV insulin and discharged from the unit and is

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 73 year old male with a
history of hypertension , diabetes
mellitus , congestive heart failure , who has had multiple previous
admissions to Lourdes Memorial Medical Center with exacerbations of
his congestive heart failure , most recently 27 of February The patient
was reasonably well until approximately 4-5 weeks ago when he
initially noticed slight worsening of bilateral ankle swelling.
This has progressively worsened until the date of admission when
swelling had progressed up to his waist. In the last 2-3 weeks , he
also noted slow worsening of his exertional dyspnea. Prior to
this , he was rarely limited by shortness of breath , but does not
exert himself much. Recently , however , exercise tolerance has
decreased to 3 to 50 feet on flat ground. Patient denied shortness
of breath at rest until yesterday evening when he noted slight
dyspnea also associated with a vague chest tightness. Patient
subsequently went to bed , slept on his usual two pillows. He woke
suddenly at 4:00 A.M. the morning of admission with severe
shortness of breath , chest tightness , and a sensation of general
fatigue. He was unable to get back to sleep because of worsened
orthopnea. His daughter called the EMTs who took the patient to
the Pathhydenoa Ryside Community Hospital Emergency Room. His initial EKG showed a
rate of 150 and he was loaded with procainamide after no change
after being treated with IV adenosine. After treatment with O2 ,
his chest tightness resolved. He denied nausea , vomiting ,
lightheadedness or diaphoresis on presentation. He also denied
palpitations during the past few weeks , but has noted episodic
palpitations in the past. He denies any previous episodes of chest
pain or angina. In addition , he denies syncope and presyncope.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Congestive heart failure/ischemic
cardiomyopathy with recent echo of 10/16 with
an ejection fraction of 20% with antero and inferior apical
hypokinesis. 2. Non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
diagnosed in 1988 , treated with oral agents. 3. Hypertension. 4.
Status post varicose vein surgery of the left leg.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg q.day , digoxin 0.25 mg q.day ,
glyburide 2.5 mg q.day , lisinopril 10 mg q.day , Lasix
40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient is a retired ship engineer , immigrated
to the Dayna Sas from Shanpro Owma Street He lives with
his daughter in Li , originally from Monte Terster Go He
smokes 1/2 pack per day x 48 years , stopped when he moved to the
Sy Virgs Lihamdale Alcohol - intermittent binge drinking without
regular heavy consumption.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Heart rate was 120 , blood pressure 90/70 ,
without orthostatic change. HEENT showed
pupils were equal , round , reactive to light. Extracular movements
intact. Oropharynx was clear. Neck showed JVP above the jaw with
a question of A waves. Chest showed decreased breath sounds at the
bases bilaterally with bibasilar crackles. Cardiac exam was
regularly irregular S1 , S2 , + S3 and S4 , 2/6 pansystolic murmur to
the apex. Abdominal exam was soft , nontender , nondistended , with a
palpable liver edge , nonpulsatile. No splenomegaly. Extremities
showed 3+ bilateral pitting edema. Distal pulses were not palpable
bilaterally. Femoral pulses 2+ bilaterally. Neurologic exam was
grossly nonfocal. Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly with pulmonary
vascular redistribution and perivascular cuffing. EKG showed
atrial flutter with 2:1 block at a rate of 135 with
intraventricular conduction delay with right bundle branch block
pattern , as well as poor R wave progression.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular. After patient had been
treated with procainamide in the emergency room ,
he became hypotensive and was subsequently cardioverted. His blood
pressure recovered to his baseline of 90 systolic and he was
started on Ace inhibitors. He was also treated with IV Lasix and
started on heparin. Because of his disproportionate right
ventricular failure , he did undergo a VQ scan which was low
probability.
Patient had recurrent episodes of atrial tachycardia and was loaded
orally with amiodarone. In addition , he had some short runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
After aggressive diuresis , the patient was noted to have an
increasing BUN/creatinine. He was started on IV dobutamine on
14 of July and was continued on captopril and Isordil. He diuresed well
on dobutamine and was restarted on digoxin. The dobutamine was
weaned to off on 11 of January He was restarted on IV Lasix.
On 25 of August , patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a
40% mid LAD lesion , 40% OM , 40% RCA. His pressures showed an RA
pressure of 10 , RV 50/12 , with a mean PA pressure of 34 , a
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , cardiac output 3.0 , with
an index of 1.6 , SVR 1800. It was therefore felt that his
cardiomyopathy which had initially been attributed to ischemic
etiology , was likely idiopathic or secondary to alcohol. The
patient was subsequently transferred to the KH with Swan-Ganz
catheter in place. He was again treated with dobutamine and
Isordil and his captopril was titrated upwards. Repeat echo showed
an ejection fraction of 20% with an unstable LV thrombus. He was
subsequently restarted on heparin , followed by loading with
Coumadin. He was transferred back to the floor on 2 of February and
remained hemodynamically stable on captopril , Isordil , amiodarone ,
digoxin and aspirin. His Lasix intravenous was converted to p.o.
torsemide with good fluid balance.
2. Neurology. The patient was noted to complain of
lightheadedness , vertigo and ringing in his ears after receiving
his doses of captopril. He underwent noninvasive carotids which
showed a subtotal occlusion of his right internal carotid artery.
He underwent combined cardiac catheterization and carotid
angiography on 11 of January Angiography revealed a greater than 90% right
internal carotid stenosis. Following the procedure , he had a
transient 5-10 minute episode of decreased responsiveness and
decreased left hand grip , which resolved completely. On 30 of January ,
he underwent right carotid endarterectomy complicated by a small
right neck hematoma which resolved spontaneously. He had no
further symptoms and was able to tolerate captopril up to 25 mg
t.i.d.
3. Hematology. The patient was anticoagulated with heparin
followed by Coumadin as above , for his LV thrombus , with a target
INR of 2.5 to 3.
4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Patient's blood
sugars were well controlled on p.o. glyburide.
5. Renal. Patient's creatinine on admission was 1.4. His
creatinine transiently rose to 2.2 with aggressive diuresis , but
fell to 1.4 on discharge.
The patient was discharged home with VNA services on 23 of March He
was stable on discharge. He is to follow up with Dr. Seth Scheirman on 10 of February
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.day , enteric

Discharge Date: 11/24/2005
ATTENDING: FABROQUEZ , COY MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Cough , nausea , vomiting , and chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease , diabetes , hypertension , CHF , and COPD who was admitted
on 2/21/05 after presenting to the emergency department
complaining of three weeks of feeling unwell. The patient states
that approximately three weeks prior to admission , she developed
increased lower extremity edema. She also noted increased cough
and shortness of breath. Approximately two weeks prior to the
admission , she doubled her Lasix dose without much improvement in
her symptoms. About one week prior to the admission , she began
to have abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting. She continued to
have cough and shortness of breath at this time. The evening
prior to presentation , she had substernal chest pain , which
radiated to her arm x1 hour. This pain improved after taking two
sublingual nitroglycerin tables. She presented to the emergency
department the following day complaining of shortness of breath
and fatigue.
In the emergency department , the patient's vital signs were noted
to be heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 94/40 with O2 sat 98%
on room air. She was complaining of shortness of breath and
fatigue. Her blood pressure subsequently decreased further to
77/48. At this time , she was bolused with IV fluids ,
approximately 1.5 to 2 liters. Following the fluid bolus , she
developed wheezing and was treated with nebulizers. However , she
became more nauseated and dyspneic and her blood pressure
continued to fall. Dopamine was started for blood pressure
support. When she continued to desaturate into the 80% range and
she was subsequently intubated. An echocardiogram at the bedtime
showed a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25%. In
addition , her labs returned with an elevated troponin of 4.5.
She had a subsequent chest x-ray , which documented pulmonary
edema. She was admitted for flash pulmonary edema and was
transferred directly from the emergency department to the cardiac
cath laboratory. In the cath lab , her bypass grafts of the LIMA
to the LAD and SVG to OMB were noted to be patent. However , all
the other grafts were occluded. No interventions were
undertaken. She was also noted to have elevated right and
left-sided pressures with right atrial pressure of 32 and a mean
pulmonary artery pressure of 51 and a left wedge pressure of 40.
She was subsequently transferred to the CCU where she was also
noted to have a serum creatinine of 2.3 and making very small
amounts of urine. A pH at that time was 7.13. Her cardiac
output , cardiac index ratios were 6.8 to 3. She was treated with
sodium bicarb and Lasix IV drip. Overnight , she developed a
brisk diuresis and her hypotension resolved. An echocardiogram
obtained on hospital day two showed an estimated ejection
fraction of 45%. The entire inferior wall was noted to be
akinetic. The posterior wall was moderately hypokinetic. Global
right ventricular systolic function was severely reduced. She
was also note to have a thickened , calcified mitral valve with
severe mitral regurgitation.
Her CCU course was notable for two positive blood cultures , one
drawn on 2/21/05 and the other drawn on 4/10/05 for which she
was started first on vancomycin and then switched to nafcillin
for Coag-negative staph bacteremia. She was also diagnosed with
a UTI and started on levofloxacin. She was eventually extubated
on 11/18/05. She was discharged from the CCU on 10/30/05 , and
was accepted on to the Cards Aworth Service.

27 , alkaline phosphatase 66 , and total bili 0.2. CK 141 , MB 8.2 ,
troponin peaked at 4.46 and subsequently trended down.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Following discharge from the Coronary Care
Unit: In summary , the patient is a 64-year-old female , admitted
on 2/21/05 , complaining of subacute progressive symptoms of CHF
in addition to a more acute onset of nausea and vomiting. She
presented to the emergency department hypotensive , which was
probably related to dehydration due to decreased p.o. intake as
well as continued Lasix use. When given IV fluids , she went into
flash pulmonary edema , requiring transfer to the CCU and
intubation. The patient underwent emergent cath , which showed no
new intervenable disease , but did show severe MR. She was
admitted to the CCU where she was aggressively diuresed and
weaned of the vent. She was transferred to the floor on
4/13/05.
Her hospital course by system is as follows.
Cardiac ischemia. The patient underwent catheterization on
2/21/05 , which showed 100% obstruction in the SVG to RCA graft ,
60% obstruction in the RIMA to the marginal 1 graft , patent LIMA
to the LAD , and patent SVG to OM1 and OM2. Note was made of
markedly elevated right and left-sided filling pressures. No
stents were placed. We continued management of her ischemia with
aspirin , beta-blocker , Lipitor , and Imdur. In addition , we
started an ACE inhibitor , which had been initially held due to
her hypotension. This was restarted on 10/30/05 for afterload
reduction , given her severe mitral regurgitation. Over the
course of her CCU stay and her hospital stay on the Cardiac
Service , she continued to clinically improve. We felt that her
mitral regurgitation was likely dynamic , related to her CHF flare
and ischemia. We would recommend outpatient echo for further
follow-up of her mitral regurgitation.
Rhythm. The patient at baseline has paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation , on Coumadin. Here , she was noted to be in normal
sinus rhythm. Her Coumadin dose was held for two nights from
10/30/05 to 6/5/05 for planned TEE echo and a small dose of
vitamin K was given. Subsequently , the TEE was later canceled.
We are therefore restarting the patient on her home dose of
Coumadin , but her INR may rise somewhat slowly due to the vitamin
K. We have asked her to have her labs checked on 9/13/05 for an
INR check.
Infectious disease. The patient was noted to have two positive
cultures for Coag-negative staph , one drawn on 2/21/05 and one
drawn on 5/29/05. She was initially started on vancomycin on
2/30/05 and then switched to nafcillin based on her
sensitivities. The plan was to obtain a TEE to evaluate her for
endocarditis. However , on further review of the sensitivity , we
conclude that two bottles represent two different Coag-negative
staph species. We feel that this most likely represents
contamination rather than true bacteremia. This was discussed
with the ID fellow who agreed with our assessment. Therefore ,
the TEE was discontinued and antibiotics were also discontinued.
We asked that the patient have surveillance blood cultures
checked on 9/13/05 while off all antibiotics.
The patient also had a positive UA while in the CCU and was
started on levofloxacin for a UTI. However , her urine cultures
never grew an organism. So , this was discontinued on 6/16/05.
Pulmonary. The patient has a history of COPD. She was continued
on her home inhalers as well as nebulizers as needed. She
received one course of pulse dose steroids while in the CCU for
presumed COPD infection. This was discontinued prior to her
admission to the floor.
Renal. On presentation , the patient had evidence of acute renal
failure with creatinine elevated at 2.3. However , this improved
with diuresis. She also had an MRI of the kidneys to evaluate
for renal artery stenosis on 6/16/05. This showed severe
diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta , but no
renal artery stenosis. The radiologist recommends a CT angiogram
for further work if clinically indicated as an outpatient.
Endocrine. The patient has a history of diabetes and is on
Lantus and metformin at home. Here , we held her metformin dose
and treated her instead with insulin sliding scale and Lantus.
We have asked the patient to restart her metformin upon
discharge.
FEN. The patient's goal in's and out's should be even to -500 ml
per day. We increased her home Lasix dose from 80 mg daily to 80
mg in the morning and 40 mg at night. These doses should be
subsequently adjusted to maintain her volume status as an
outpatient.
Code. Status is full code.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home on 1/7/05 with
VNA Services. VNA should assist the patient with her medications
as well as volume status checks , daily weights , and lung exams.
She has a follow-up appointment already scheduled with her
primary care doctor , Dr. Wagenheim , on 9/29/05 at 2:30 p.m. In
addition , Dr. Rayome of the Cardiology Service will see
the patient as an outpatient. The exact appointment time and
date are pending at the time of this dictation. The office has
indicated that they will call the patient for a specific
appointment time.

mmHg , multiple CHF exacs in past , DM , HTN , clinically in
CHF exacerbation.
PMH: worsening AS AVA 074 cm2 , LVEF 65% , mild TR ,
hypothyroidism , DM on insulin , CKD
Final Diagnosis: CHF exacerbation
Treatment and Response:
Note that it was very difficult to monitor her fluid status -JVP
difficult 2/2 girth of neck , often incontinent so I/O inaccurate , and has
chronic leg edema 2/2 PVD. Therefore , we adjusted diuretic regimen
primarily by how she symptomatically felt and her weights.
Initially treated with Torsemide 200 iv bid , Zaroxylyn 5 mg po bid
( 30 min before torsemide ) , and Aldactone 25 po bid. She diuresed well to
this. Over the course of hospital stay , her creatinine increased
from 1.6 to 2.2 , and though her baseline is 1.6-2.0 , we used this , along
with her symptomatic improvement and return of weight to dry weight of
114.5 kg , to establish euvolemia. For final 3 days of stay on
home regimen of torsemide 150 po bid , zaroxlyn 5 po qd , and
aldactone 25 po bid and had stable weights.
Relevant Data: Weight at d/c 114.5; VS @ d/c 98.0 , 81 , 106/60 , 20 ,
93 on RA; rales at left base
Brief Hospital Course:
See above for CHF related info
In addition , pt was found to have pan-sensitive E-coli UTI - treated with
Bactrim x 7 days. Two days before discharge her initial cough worsened
in severity and became somewhat productive. She never mounted a WBC ,
never was febrile , and CXR showed no infiltrate. Felt to be 2/2
underlying COPD - improved significantly with nebulizer tx and
Robitussen. During hospital stay , she was evaluated for home 02;
however , her ambulatory 02 sat was 94% and her nocturnal O2 sats ( done by
respiratory therapy ) were 89-93%. Therefore , not discharged on home 02 ,
though may want to consider as outpt.

Zestril 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation ,
Tylenol #3 for pain and iron supplements.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile with temperature of 95.8.
Her heart rate was 93 in atrial
fibrillation. Her blood pressure was 124/77. She was satting 100%
on room air. She had an irregularly irregular rhythm. Lungs clear
to auscultation. Her abdomen was distended with shifting dullness.
She had diffuse tenderness. She has guaiac positive stools. She
had no guarding or rebound.
LABORATORY: Her sodium is 140 , her potassium is 3.7 , her
creatinine was 1.1 , her LFTs were all within normal
range with the exception of a slightly elevated alkaline
phosphatase at 238. Her total bilirubin was 1.4 , her lipase was
25 , amylase was 57 , white count was 5.7 , hematocrit was 30.3 , coags
were notable for an INR of 2.1. Her UA was negative with only two

isolated cluster of small bowel with a closed loop without signs of
mesenteric ischemia. She also had a small ventral hernia. The
patient was given 6 units of FFP and taken to the operating room
for an exploratory laparotomy.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating after her
anticoagulation was reversed. She had an
exploratory laparotomy , lysis of adhesions , with an obstructed loop of
small bowel , with multiple adhesions around the closed
loop obstruction. There was fecal spillage due to an enterotomy within
a closed loop. All of the bowel was viable , and therefore no resection was
required. A moderately sized bezoar was removed
from the small bowel in the area of the obstruction. The EBL was 400 cc. She
was given two units of FFP in the OR. She had 1 , 500 cc of fluid as
well as two units of packed cells , about 1 liter os ascites was
drained intraoperatively. Her abdomen was closed with sepra mesh.
She was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
Postoperatively , she had fairly stable vital signs with a brief
episode of hypotension immediately postoperatively. She was
sedated with Fentanyl and Versed in terms of her cardiac status.
Her atrial fibrillation was persistent and she was receiving
Lopressor 10 mg IV q.6h. Respiratory , she was intubated and on
pressor support of 15 with a blood gas that showed she was
oxygenating well. For GI , she had an NG tube in and she was
n.p.o. , had Zantac. GU , she was continued fluid resuscitation.

nutitional support via NG feedings. She underwent a tracheostomy on POD #15.
She then proceeded to make a slow but steady recovery , with normalization of
her body fluid status , hepatic function , and mental function. At the time of
her discharge , her major issues were ventillatory support , with ongoing
compromise from chronic right heart failure.
Tubes , lines , and drains. She had a left brachial vein PICC Line
placed on November . The line was measured at 45 cm. She had a Foley
in place. She had a #7 portex trach tube. She also had an NG tube

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Aortic valve area evaluation HPI
admitted for aortic valve evaluation via catherization. This patient was
scheduled to have cystoscopy and bladder intervention for a possible
bladder cancer as well as TURP at Whee Hospital on 2/1/2006. His
surgeon wanted a pre-surgical cardiac evaluation given this history of
AS. The patient has had not changes in his functional activity recently.
Of note , his past history is notable for 5/23 with a right hemispheric
ischemic stroke. He has been having a gradual recovery: there is no
sensitivity in the left leg , though the motor deficits have improved and
he is able to walk with a walker. When he really exerts himself , he had
episodes of SOB but no chest pain , palpitations , presyncope or syncope.
He does have an unclear history of orthopnea but it might not be of a
cardiac etiology. Of note his activity has not been limited by any
cardiac complaints.

presenting with CP and pressure , lightheadedness and SOB x 3days. Sx c/w
unstable angina vs. coronary vasospasm vs. incisional/pleuritic pain s/p
CABG.
--CV: Patient admitted w/ sx of SOB , SSCP and pressure , diaphoresis ,
lightheadedness that lasted 5-15 minutes per episode , did not radiate
other than to abdomen , very concerning for ACS vs. unstable angina ,
especially in the setting of known CAD and recent 4-vessel CABG ( SH : BCH
-> 1st diagonal and then to LAD , L radial artery anastomosis to distal
RCA , L saphenous vein to left circumflex first major marginal; post
surgery SSUH echo w/ EF of 43% and some basilar hypokinesis , patient
started on amiodarone for bigeminy ). Dressler's less likely at this time
out from post-op.
( I ) In the ED , the EKG on admission showed NSR , 1-2 mm ST elevations in
leads V1-V3 , T wave inversions in V4-V6 , concerning for acute cardiac
process. No comparison EKG for baseline so unable to ascertain if new
ischemia or if ACS in setting of sx. Patient rec'd ASA , nitro x3 w/
relief and 2 mg morphine in ED. CXR was performed showing bilateral
effusions w/ L>R. Enzyme set A was negative. Patient was admitted to
floor , where a repeat EKG was done , which showed changes from his prior
EKG , specifically a new T wave inversion in V3 and trigeminy with PVCs.
Patient reported mild pain at this time. Signs & symptoms were
concerning enough for ACS that the patient was started on a heparin drip
of 1000cc/hr with a loading bolus of 5000 units and his PTT followed.
Home isosorbide was held to ascertain for pain. Records were requested
from Wickstra Hospital , where the patient had his surgery 1 month ago.
Patient was put on telemetry and his home Lipitor was increased to 80
mg , and his home lopressor was increased to 37.5 mg TID. Overnight he was
pain free , and r/o'd by enzymes x 3. His telemetry showed NSR w/
occasional trigeminy and PVCs. Pain may be incisional or anginal ,
lightheadedness most likely patient's anginal equivalent. Cardiology was
consulted to consider the indications for catheterization and risk of ACS.
The patient was asx 10/3 and noted to have some sternal incisional pain
with palpation , no EKG changes observed. Reccomendations were made to send
the patient to ETT-MIBI 4/12 , check fasting am lipids , d/c home amiodarone
from RH for his ? arrythmia. The patient was also started on Lisinopril
5mg at this time and his heparin drip was d/c'd. ETT-MIBI showed no signs
of reversible ischemia , basal wall hypokinesis but which was knwon on
admission. Fasting cholesterol was unable to be sent 2/2 to am MIBI
schedule. Should be tested as outpatient.
( P ): No signs of pump dysfunction though mildly elevated jvp of 6-8cm on
admission , EF post-CABG at LMVH was 43%. Repeat echo was ordered to assess
function though cancelled in setting of unremarkable MIBI and absence of of
sx and signs failure while in house.
( R ): Alternates between NSR and trigeminy with PVCs. Amiodarone from TH
d/c's as not needed for this rhythym.
--Renal: h/o hematuria at MMH , microhematuria on U/A and urine sed on
admission. Will require outpatient follow up. Per LAH noted he would need
renal bx and follow-up though it does not seem appropriate w/ h/o foley and
hematuria. Cystoscopy seems more relevant. We consulted the patient's PCP
and agree to recommend outpatient urology follow-up over renal. Urine
cytology was ordered and collected ( though some lost to collection during
MIBI ). Can be followed as outpatient.
--Pulm: cxr w/ bilateral effusions L>R but which are consistent with a
setting of recent cardiac surgery. Patient noted + SOB w/ pain. PE
unlikely as infection. Exam resolved slightly over course of stay.
PPx: Pt on heparin drip w/ ? of ACS on 9/9 , lovenox held. Haprin d/c'd 10/3
in pm. Lovenox held as patient ambulatory and to home on 4/18

7 ) GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE.
8 ) ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69 year-old woman
with a history of heart failure ,
preserved ejection fraction , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,
obstructive sleep apnea , mild pulmonary hypertension who had an
increase in Torsemide dose from 100 mg b.i.d. to 180 mg b.i.d. She
also was subsequently started on Zaroxolyn two days prior to
admission. She has felt increasingly tired and light headed
without dyspnea. She has had a very dry mouth. She has also noted
a decline in urine output. She is admitted to the short stay unit
on May , 2000 when her BUN and creatinine were 125 and 4.2
respectively. This compared to a baseline creatinine of about 2.0.
She was admitted for intravenous hydration. She continues to
complain of dizziness when she sits up at the time of admission and
her creatinine has declined from 4.6 to 2.1 off all her medications
and with some mild hydration over the first two days of admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Diabetes mellitus. 2 ) Gastroesophageal
reflux disease. 3 ) Gout. 4 ) Congestive
heart failure secondary diastolic dysfunction. 5 ) Diverticulosis
in 1998. 6 ) Obstructive sleep apnea. 7 ) Hypertension. 8 )
Chronic renal insufficiency , baseline creatinine of about 2.0. 9 )
Anemia of chronic disease.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to Morphine.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married. She has five children and
two foster children. She quit smoking around nine
years ago. She uses a cane with walking.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission was
significant for chest examination which was
clear. Cardiac examination was muffled , but you could hear an S4 ,
S1 and S2 with a jugular venous pressure around 7 cm , positive
hepatojugular reflux , 1+ peripheral edema of both legs.
Extremities were warm and well perfused. Abdomen is obese and
soft. There was no cyanosis or clubbing in the extremities.
LABORATORY: EKG showed a left ventricular hypertrophy , first
degree atrioventricular block with a heart rate around
90.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was initially admitted to the short
stay unit and was given fluid for two days and
all of her medications were held. She was admitted to the
Cardiology Service , however on April , 2000 , she had been inhouse
with that being her fourth day. Her cardiac medications were
progressively re-initiated and her Imdur was increased to 120 mg
p.o. b.i.d. Her course is notable for progressive decline in her
BUN and creatinine. On April , 2000 we restarted her Lisinopril at
10 mg b.i.d. She came in on 20 mg b.i.d. She did fine with this.
The next , however we restarted her Torsemide and increased her dose
of Lisinopril. This resulted in a bump of her BUN and creatinine
back up to around 2.8 from 1.9. Because she diuresed a total of
about 300 cc that day , we presumed this bump was due to increase
dose of Lisinopril. We decreased the dose back to 10 mg b.i.d. and
continued her Torsemide. The patient's BUN and creatinine
stabilized then at 63 and 2.8. Because of this response to
Lisinopril , we performed a renal artery scan with results pending
at the time of this dictation. The patient also at the time of
discharge clearly at her driest considering the medication regimen
that she is on. She is clearly orthostatic this morning. She will
be discharged on 100 mg p.o. Torsemide b.i.d. with before knowledge
that she will drink quite a bit more than she does inhouse. She
will be followed up for her potassium , renal function and renal
artery scan by Dr. Mel Minshall

ATTENDING: KRIEGE , DERRICK M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right thigh burn , cellulitis and diabetic
ketoacidosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Hesby is a 36-year-old woman
with very poorly controlled type 1 diabetes and extensive end
organ damage including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ,
right eye blindness , lower extremity neuropathy , gastroparesis
and a history of extensive infections including VRE line sepsis ,
MRSA , abdominal abscesses and chronic dermal ulcers. Due to her
dermal ulcers , she developed left ankle osteomyelitis requiring
below-the-knee amputation. She was transferred from Shiredo Sert Of Valley on 1/24/06 in DKA in the setting of a right thigh burn
and possible infection.
The patient was in her usual state of health until three days
prior to admission when she spilled hot broth on her right thigh
and developed a painful red bullae. She presented to Path Community Hospital two days prior to admission , but still she had an
infection. She was given a prescription for antibiotics , which
she did not fill. The area of swelling in her right leg did not
spread from the original blister area all the way up to her groin
and grossly became more tender and warm. On the day of
admission , she returned to the Threei Cent Hospital Emergency Room
for evaluation. Of note , in going to the emergency room , she
missed her regular hemodialysis. In the Ingsparks Down Health
Emergency room , the following vital signs were noted.
Temperature afebrile , heart rate 60 , blood pressure 150/50 ,
oxygen saturation 95% on room air. WBC 4.3 , hematocrit 38 ,
sodium 126 , potassium 7.9 , glucose 1221 , anion gap 13 , acetone
negative , AST 385 , ALT 127 and alk phos 411. EKG revealed peak Q
waves. The patient was given 20 units of IV insulin and then was
started on an insulin drip 8 units per hour. She also received 2
amps of calcium gluconate as well as Kayexalate and albuterol
nebs. A repeat Chem-7 in the Amoore Medical Center ED showed a glucose of
1100 and an anion gap of 18 with potassium 5.4. The patient was
transferred to the MICU at EH for further management. At the
time of her transfer , she noted left-sided headache , a warm
feeling over her right thigh. She denied any recent fever ,
shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting or
diarrhea. She did note that her last bowel movement was three
days prior to admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. DKA: The patient was stabilized in the MICU on an insulin
drip and was then transferred to General Medicine for further
management. Causes of DKA that were ruled out included the
following - negative cardiac enzymes , unimpressive pancreatic
enzymes , unimpressive lactate , normal LFTs. The patient's DKA
was presumed to be due to her right thigh cellulitis in the
setting of a local burn. She initially was given 500 mL normal
saline boluses and then several 250 mL boluses. As she is
aneuric , her boluses were stopped once the blood sugars were
below 500. She initially was placed on insulin drip that was
then transitioned to NPH and finally to Lantus 24 units subcu
daily. Of note , the patient intermittently refused to take both
her long-acting and her insulin sliding scale. As a result , an
endocrinology consult was called. The patient was noted to be
ordering extra food from the kitchen , which could in part explain
her labile sugars. Despite careful diet and glucose control
efforts , the patient still had sugars at times to the 500s.
Endocrinology continues to leave recommendations about AC
standing insulin in addition to her NovoLog sliding scale and
Lantus insulin. The patient has a history of gastroparesis and
therefore may not tolerate AC insulin very well. The patient's
new covering team will continue to follow up with Endocrinology.
2. Right thigh cellulitis: The patient was placed on Augmentin
and IV vancomycin. Her area of cellulitis has completely
resolved at the present time with slight sloughing of the
overlying skin. The underlying skin is pink with evidence of
good granulation and no further evidence of infection. Given
that her IV access is very difficult , the patient received some
vancomycin , as she finishes hemodialysis every other day.
3. End-stage renal disease: The patient missed her dialysis on
the day of admission. Once in the hospital , her potassium was
very difficult to control in part due to poor adherence with her
renal diet and in part due to her very labile sugars. At times ,
her potassium would rapidly increase to a level higher than 6.5
requiring urgent dialysis. At the present time , the patient has
been dialyzed daily since her admission. She is closely followed
by renal with plans to continue dialysis while in the hospital.
She should not receive any further intravenous fluids unless she
has evidence of recurrent DKA , given her anuric state. Should
she become acidotic , the patient can be managed with sodium
bicarbonate and D5W in small boluses.
4. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , there was no evidence of chest
pain. The patient has showed no EKG signs of ischemia. Her
cardiac enzymes remained negative. Lipids are pending at the
present time. Lipid profile check is pending at the present
time. Pump , the patient has a history of CHF with evidence of
right heart failure likely due to valvular disease in some aspect
of the diastolic dysfunction given her preserved ejection
fraction. Her weight on admission was 70 kg. We did not know
her dry weight. Dialysis is helping to manage her fluids given
her aneuric status. Her O2 sats remained stable on room air
throughout the hospitalization. Her hypertension has been
somewhat poorly controlled and for that reason she was continued
on her home dose of Lopressor 25 q.i.d. and switched to
Captopril , which we continued to titrate at the present time.
Rhythm , normal sinus rhythm. The patient is currently on
telemetry with no signs of arrhythmia.
5. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: The patient was placed on a
cardiac , renal and diabetic diet. She was noted to repeatedly
order extra food from the kitchen supervisor. Nutrition
endocrinology and nursing staff are all aware and are working
diligently to prevent the patient from receiving more than 2000
calories per day as specified by her ADA diet. She is continuing
her Nephrocaps and sevelamer. Prophylaxis , heparin 5000 units
subcu t.i.d. - the patient has consistently refused her heparin.
6. Consent: All interventions require consent from the
patient's medical guardian , Stanley Paneque ( please see number
above ).
7. Code status: The patient is full code and this has been
confirmed with the guardian.
ADDENDUM
Of note , on the night of 10/22/06 , the patient complained of
severe cramping , right lower quadrant pain , which is new. She
noted this pain has increased rapidly in the setting of diarrhea.
Several C. diff studies , which were sent recently have been
negative and the patient has had no blood in her diarrhea.
Presumed cause is Augmentin , which has been stopped. The patient
has continued to eat freely and is passing diarrhea despite her
complaints of 10/10 severe abdominal pain. A CT scan of her
abdomen was ordered , but she refused to take oral or IV contrast.
The results of this CT scan are pending and will be followed up
by the new medical team.

ATTENDING: MORRIS VALLOT MD
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Anemia , GI bleed and CHF exacerbation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with multiple past
cardiovascular medical issues including hypertension , diabetes ,
hypercholesterolemia , nonobstructive CAD on prior catheterization
of 1993 and idiopathic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction
reported at baseline from the Burgthan Hospital to be
45% , prior echocardiogram in Montsair Community Hospital from
1994 reported at 25 to 30% , question alcoholic cardiomyopathy ,
atrial fibrillation. He is status post right MCA CVA while on
Coumadin for atrial fibrillation and peripheral vascular disease ,
history of GI bleed who presented with increased shortness of
breath and cough x several weeks. He noted initial shortness of
breath and nonproductive cough in the end of 9/24 with a
question infiltrate on chest film at that time and the patient
was treated with a 10-day course of antibiotics of unknown
content question levofloxacin with no improvement. Since late
9/24 , the patient reports progressive shortness of breath ,
dyspnea on exertion particularly with ambulation of steps and
when lying down. Additionally , the patient reports a vague band
like pain discomfort over left anterior chest particularly
associated with ambulation of steps and when lying supine. Chest
pain is associated with shortness of breath , but denies
lightheadedness , diaphoresis or recent nausea and vomiting.
Symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath are notably worse
over the last one to two weeks through the patient reports
resolution over the last 24 hours with question of a new
medication that he is unable recall. He denies palpitation or
raising heart rate. He does report orthopnea , denies PND , but
does report intermittent lower extremity swelling. He denies
hematochezia , bright red blood per rectum , hematemesis with
question of melanotic stools over the last month. The patient
also with a history of prior GI bleed while in Lan , West Virginia 39586 several
years prior for which he was transfused 4 units of packed red
blood cells. EGD colonoscopy at that time revealed both upper
and lower GI lesions including several small AVM and
diverticulosis. Additionally , upper GI endoscopy performed at
that time revealed duodenitis.
The patient was seen in a Pleaermount Medical Center today
reportedly in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. He had
previously been reported to be in this abnormal rhtyhm that
converted to normal sinus rhythm while on amiodarone. He was
noted to have rapid ventricular response in 120s. He had
appeared pale. Hematocrit obtained at that time reportedly 21.4
and the patient was admitted to the Nipaul Ingways Community Hospital
for further evaluation.

patient reports no alcohol in the last 20 years. The patient
currently lives with his girlfriend of 45 years and is local to
O Lasmerflinteans Louis
FAMILY HISTORY:
Family history is noncontributory. No history of a sudden
cardiac death.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs on admission include a temperature of 98 , heart rate
of 112 , blood pressure 168/90 , respiratory rate 20 93% on room
air. He was in no acute distress though the patient was seen to
be in shortness of breath when lying at 20 to 30 degrees. JVP on
admission 12 to 15 cm of water , difficult to assess given
habitus. The patient additionally with bibasilar rales ,
one-third to one-half up with poor air movement. No egophony or
consolidation was appreciated. Abdominal exam was unremarkable.
Lower extremities were warm and well perfused. He was able to
move all extremities , 4/5 strength in his right hand. He had
positive peripheral pulses and 1+ lower extremity edema , left
greater than right to mid calf.
LABORATORY DATA:
Laboratory values on admission are significant for creatinine of
1.8 of unknown baseline and glucose of 192. LFTs were within
normal limit. White count of 8.7 , hematocrit of 21.4 , down from
baseline of 30 to 35 and platelets of 351 , 000. MCV on hematocrit
was 84.
EKG on admission showed irregularly regular rhythm at 120 likely
atrial fibrillation versus atrial flutter with variable block , ST
segment depression laterally in V5 through V6 , question demand
ischemia versus digoxin effect , left bundle branch block which is
reportedly the patient's baseline. Chest film with vascular
prominence at the hilum bilaterally , question mass infiltrate
over left lower lobe with no overt effusions.
ASSESSMENT:
The patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with extensive past
cardiac and otherwise medical history presenting to the Mahunt Medical Center with CHF exacerbation , anemia with question
GI bleed with hematocrit in the 20s and question
community-acquired pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient with no evidence of acute
coronary syndrome. On admission , the patient was noted to be in
a rapid ventricular response at 120 and with CHF exacerbation.
The patient initially with complaint of chest pressure , which was
concerning for demand ischemia in the setting significant anemia
with increased heart rate and known ventricular dysfunction.
Cardiac enzymes were drawn and serially were elevated with a peak
troponin I of 4. Subsequent serial cardiac enzymes resolved to
baseline values. The patient was initially started on heparin IV
drip for concern for unstable plaque , but following consultation
with Dr. Slaney in Cardiology , it was recommended anticoagulation
be stopped secondary to recent GI bleed and low concern for acute
coronary syndrome versus demand ischemia. Additionally , the
patient was rate controlled with IV following p.o. Lopressor ,
digoxin and amiodarone. Additionally , the patient's ACE
inhibitor was continued and titrated up to lisinopril 40. The
patient was initially diuresed given significant volume overload
with IV Lasix with diuresis of 4 to 8 liters over the hospital
course. Echocardiogram obtained during decompensated episode
revealed EF of 25 to 30% with global hypokinesis and septal
akinesis , was significantly altered from prior echocardiogram of
9/16/03 obtained at the Wellcamp University Of Medical Center which had
revealed an EF of 40 to 45% with mild global HK. However , of
note , this echocardiogram was similar to prior echocardiogram in
Alehealtdana Bafound Hospital system from 1994 with no additional
wall motion abnormalities. The patient's cardiovascular issues
felt to stem secondary to anemia in the setting of increased
ventricular response and tachycardia , which led to demand
ischemia and subsequent troponin leak causing decompensated CHF.
The patient's symptomatology resolved with proper rate control
and resuscitation with IV fluids and blood. The patient's heart
rate was well controlled in the 60s to 70s and following IV
diuresis , the patient's CHF symptomatology resolved. At the time
of discharge , the patient was ambulating without difficulty with
no oxygen requirement. The patient was transitioned to all p.o.
regimen.
2. Heme: The patient with recent GI bleed with known both upper
and lower GI lesions including AVM and diverticulosis for which
the patient has been previously treated. The patient's
hematocrit on admission 21.4. The patient received 4 units of
packed red blood cells to stable hematocrit of 29 to 30 x 72
hours. In addition , the patient was never hemodynamically
unstable during admission. GI bleed felt to be a precipitating
etiology. The patient was seen by the GI Service , was
recommended further outpatient evaluation and upper and lower GI
endoscopy evaluation as required. The patient to follow up with
Dr. Rosendo in the Erpin Medical Center and outpatient EGD
and colonoscopy to be scheduled for the next week or two to
further evaluate. At the time of discharge , the patient's
hematocrit stable at 29 , no evidence of active GI bleed present.
Additionally , the patient initially held on Coumadin giving
concern for ongoing GI bleed and following stable transfusion ,
the patient's Coumadin was restarted at initially 5 and then
later 3 mg p.o. q.h.s. with INR goal of 2.8. To be further
evaluated as outpatient and INR to be checked on 5/11/04 in Dr.
Paider office and titration of Coumadin as required.
3. GI: As mentioned prior , the patient with GI bleed , thought
to be precipitating etiology of the patient's current
hospitalization. The patient maintained on IV Protonix b.i.d.
and transitioned to p.o. Prilosec 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. As
mentioned , prior to GI consult , the patient will receive the
outpatient evaluation with EGD and colonoscopy as required for
further management.
4. Pulmonary: The patient with history of productive cough ,
fevers , chills. On admission , previously treated with course of
antibiotics , presumably Levaquin for presumed community-acquired
pneumonia giving ongoing symptomatology , the patient treated
initially with IV antibiotics including ceftriaxone and
azithromycin transitioned to cefpodoxime and azithromycin. The
patient to complete full 10-day course of antibiotics for
presumed community-acquired pneumonia. At the time of discharge ,
the patient afebrile , ambulating without difficulty , no dyspnea
on exertion and O2 saturation 95% on room air.
5. Psychiatry: The patient with long tobacco history given
extensive cardiovascular status , the patient received addiction
consultation regarding tobacco cessation. Following
consultation , the patient showing good promise regarding tobacco
cessation. He has expressed interest in doing so. As such , the
patient's antianxiety and depression medications have been
altered. The patient to decrease Zoloft to 25 mg p.o. q.d. from
50 and to continue that for seven days , following which time , he
should discontinue his Zoloft. Additionally , the patient started
on Wellbutrin initially 150 mg p.o. q.d. x seven days , to
transition up to b.i.d. as tolerated within seven days time as
Zoloft is discontinued , recommend further outpatient evaluation
as needed. The patient with several episodes of sundowning
during his hospital course , treated with Haldol with no further
incidents.
6. Endocrine: The patient with known diabetes , maintained on
Regular Insulin sliding scale with good blood sugar control. The
patient to continue on outpatient regimen of Avandia and
Glucophage. The patient may require additional anti-glycemic
medications in future as necessary.
7. Renal: The patient with chronicrenal insufficiency on
admission with a creatinine of 1.8 presumed baseline. At the
time of discharge , the patient's creatinine had resolved to 1.3 ,
thought to be secondary to cardiorenal syndrome in the setting of
acute CHF decompensation , recommend further outpatient management
evaluation. The patient to follow up with Dr. Mcculler in the Lumspe Black Healthcare on 5/11/04 at 1:00 p.m. at which time ,
recommend further evaluation of hematocrit , INR , electrolyte as
required.

This patient is a 72-year-old female with a left plantar fifth
metatarsal ulcer since 3/14 The patient previously had an
ulcer in the same area , which healed successfully. The patient
had recurrence of her neuropathic ulcer and it has worsened and
deepened with progression to osteomyelitis involving the
metatarsal phalangeal joint. The patient's wound healing has
been confounded by longstanding lower extremity edema and as
well as congestive heart failure and venous stasis. The
ulcer has been previously treated with debridement , however , in
5/23 , it became infected and the patient developed left lower
extremity cellulitis , which progressed to the knee. The patient
was treated with antibiotics and subsequently developed profuse
diarrhea and was found to have a Clostridium difficile infection.
The patient was treated with oral Flagyl and vancomycin. She
presents on admission with continued loose stool. The patient
had previously undergone a three-phase bone scan , which was
positive for osteomyelitis and then confirmed by a gallium scan.
The patient has had decreased sensation from bilateral mid tibia
extending distally and denies pain. The patient is admitted from
a rehabilitation facility where she undergoes physical therapy.
At baseline , the patient has poor ambulation and is wheelchair
bound. The patient's cardiovascular risk factors include her
diabetes , venous stasis , coronary artery disease , hypertension ,
elevated cholesterol , and neuropathy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Lower extremity edema and venous stasis.
2. Right knee gout.
3. Ischemic cardiomyopathy , requiring AICD.
4. Status post removal of thyroid tumor.
5. Status post triple bypass coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.
6. Status post multiple myocardial infarctions.
7. Status post placement of coronary stents.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. at night , gabapentin 300 mg p.o. at
bedtime , allopurinol 150 mg p.o. daily , torsemide 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , fentanyl patch 50 mcg an
hour q.72 h. , potassium chloride 80 mEq daily , omeprazole 20 mg
daily , Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , vancomycin 250 mg orally three times
a day , Flagyl 500 mg three times a day , NPH insulin 25 units in
the morning , and oxycodone 5 mg q.4 h. p.r.n. pain.
ALLERGIES:
Sulfa causes angioedema.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
On 5/5/2006 , the patient underwent debridement of her left foot
and amputation of the left fifth metatarsal phalangeal joint. On
10/19/2006 , the patient underwent closure of her wound.
OTHER TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES:
CT angiogram:
1. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease with multiple focal areas of
mild-to-moderate stenosis seen in the origin of the SMA ,
bilateral renal arteries , common and superficial femoral arteries
and popliteal arteries.
2. Occlusion of the mid third of the posterior tibial artery
with distal reformation on the right side.
3. Three-vessel run off in the left leg.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service on
5/5/2006 after undergoing her amputation. No concerning
intraoperative events occurred; please see dictated operative
note for details. She was transferred to the floor from the PACU
in stable condition. The patient had adequate pain control and
was tolerating a regular diet by postoperative day #0. She was
placed on a fluid restriction in light of her congestive heart
failure. The patient's wound was clean with no evidence of
hematoma collection. She underwent wet-to-dry dressing changes
t.i.d. The patient underwent a CT angiogram to evaluate her
lower extremity vasculature; please see the results noted above
in the procedure section. In summary , the patient's three-vessel
run off to the left lower extremity indicated that she would not
likely need a bypass for wound healing at this time. In
addition , because the patient's wound was clean , Dr. Fregeau deemed
that it is appropriate to proceed the closure of the wound. As a
result , on 10/19/2006 , the patient returned to the operating room
and underwent closure of her wound; please see Dr. Visage 's
dictated operative note for details of this procedure. Following
both of the patient's procedures , her pain was well controlled
with oral pain medications. The patient's cardiovascular status
remained stable postoperatively. She did continue on her
home/rehabilitation facility medication regimen for her
cardiovascular issues. The patient remained stable from a
respiratory standpoint. The patient did continue to have loose
bowel movements during her hospital stay. She continued on her
admission regimen for Clostridium difficile , which consisted of
oral Flagyl and oral vancomycin. There were multiple attempts to
save a stool specimen; either the patient did not save the stool
at times or it was mixed with copious amounts of urine. As a
result , a Clostridium difficile test is pending at the time of
discharge and will need to be followed up for test of cure while
at rehabilitation. The patient's hemodynamic status was
monitored closely as well as her fluid status. The patient was
placed on a 1500 mL fluid restriction due to her CHF. The
patient did have a slight rise in her creatinine from 1.4 to 1.8 ,
at the time of discharge , the patient's creatinine was trending
back down to 1.4. The patient's electrolytes were monitored and
repeated as necessary during her hospital stay. The patient
received subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis while as an
inpatient. The patient's cultures from the operating room were
positive for MRSA , and as a result , she continued on IV
vancomycin. The patient is to continue her IV vancomycin regimen
through follow up with Dr. Gittins in clinic. The patient was seen
by the Diabetes Management Service for evaluation of her diabetes
as her blood sugars were elevated on her admission regimen. As a
result , the Diabetes Management Service recommended a regimen
consisting of 25 units of NPH in the morning , 8 units of NPH at
bedtime , a standing NovoLog regimen of 4 units with meals in
addition a NovoLog sliding scale with meals and at bedtime. The
remainder of the patient's hospital course was relatively
unremarkable and she is to be discharged in stable condition back
to rehabilitation with adequate pain control. The patient was given explicit
instructions to follow up in clinic with Dr. Kegerries in one to two weeks.

ventricle was moderately dilated. Overall LV function was low normal ,
the estimated EF of 50-55. The ventricle was
mildly hypokinetic with regional variation and right ventricle
size is mildly enlarged , global right ventricular systolic
function is moderately reduced. The left atrium is moderately
dilated and right atrium is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
is trileaflet calcified and mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation
as noted. Mitral valve is thickened and mildly retracted with
malcoaptation , moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation in some
views. The valve does not appear to coapt. Tricuspid valve is
structurally normal , but severe tricuspid regurgitation is noted
with PA pressures of 99 mmHg plus right heart pressures.
Pulmonic valve is indicated as normal with mild pulmonic
regurgitation. Aortic root size is normal measuring 3.6 cm , PA
arteries normal size , inferior vena cava is noted to be dilated ,
but not pulsatile. EKG on 5/25/05 , atrial fibrillation at the
rate of 70. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 10/10/05 and
underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed 25% proximal
LAD , 30% mid RCA , right dominant circulation. The ventriculogram
showed an ejection fraction of 64%. Hemodynamics PA mean of 22 ,
pulmonary capillary wedge of 7 , cardiac output of 4.0 , cardiac
index of 2.1 and an SVR of 1239 and PVR of 319 with moderate
aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral insufficiency. The
patient was taken to the operating room on 11/18/05 , and
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 23
Carpentier-Edwards magna valve and a mitral valve repair with a
23 CarboMedics AnnuloFlex ring and a tricuspid valve repair. The
patient also had bilateral maze procedure with also resection of
the left atrial appendage , as well as his right atrial appendage.
The patient had two A-wires and ventricular wire placed and was
initially paced after the maze procedure. The patient came off
the heart lung machine on epinephrine , levo , and
milrinone and was taken up to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit and
extubated on late postop day #1. The patient's hospital course
by systems ,
Neurological: The patient remained intact with no focal
deficits , however , the patient experienced dysphasia due to his
tonsil cancer status post XRT , failing speech and swallow and
finally requiring a PEG placement for nutritional support.
Cardiovascular: The patient was status post a maze procedure and
initially was paced and found to be in a junctional rhythm at 60
then recovery of normal sinus rhythm , however , postoperatively
had gone into a rate controlled atrial fibrillation requiring
low-dose beta-blocker as well as anticoagulation. However , he
did see few episodes of sinus rhythm and currently on discharges
in sinus rhythm and rate controlled on low-dose beta-blocker.
The patient did have an echo postoperatively to evaluate his
valve replacement and repair and found to have normal LV size and
function with an EF of 55%. The patient had mild RV enlargement ,
mild left atrial enlargement as well as right atrial enlargement.
The aortic valve was noted to be well seated with trace AI ,
mitral valve status post repair showed mild mitral regurgitation ,
tricuspid valve status post repair showed mild tricuspid repair
with PA pressures of 40 mmHg. There was no pericardial effusion
found and patient will be discharged on low-dose beta-blocker as
well as anticoagulation.
Respiratory: Patient was extubated on late postoperative day #1
and patient was on Lasix for diuresis postoperatively. The
patient , however , on postoperative day #10 , was noted to have a
temperature and culture showed that he had enterobacter in his
sputum and is being treated with ceftriaxone for a 14-day course.
His discharge chest x-ray shows no evidence consolidation and
mild atelectasis at the left base , no pulmonary edema noted.
GI: The patient had a history of GERD and was on Zantac
preoperatively and was on proton pump postoperatively and
switched over to Pepcid for GI prophylaxis. The patient also was
closely followed by the speech and swallow team and due to his
dysphagia status post squamous cell carcinoma resection of his
left tongue and XRT , patient continues to have dysphasia , unable
to protect his airway and by postoperative day #14 underwent a
PEG placement and now at goal of 70 mL per hour to see if he is
tolerating without any problems. The patient however was on
diuresis for a period of time and required few doses of fluid
bolus for his volume status.
Renal: The patient had a stable BUN and creatinine throughout
his postoperative course , was on Lasix for diuresis postop
without no elevation in his creatinine.
Endocrine: The patient was on portland protocol intraoperatively
and switched over to sliding scale insulin postoperatively due to his
tube feeds. He is on regular insulin standing now at 6 units
with sliding scale for coverage.
Heme: The patient was noted to have a drop in his platelets
postoperatively. Two hit screens were sent which were found to
be negative and patient had recovery of his platelets with
discharge platelets of 196. The patient will be discharged on
Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. Today's INR is 2.1 and he will
be getting his preop dose of 2.5 mg tonight and to follow closely
with his INR. He is also on baby aspirin for his coronary artery
disease and patient was not on Plavix for his stent
preoperatively and will not be on discharge.
ID: The patient received vancomycin for surgical prophylaxis.
On postoperative day #10 , the patient was noted to have a
temperature of 101 and was cultured. Sputum grew out
enterobacter and patient was started on ceftriaxone and will
complete a 14-day course of ceftriaxone. The patient during that
time received neb treatments , chest physical therapy and is still
continuing to bring up some secretion. The patient was noted
also to have a heel blister on his left heel which was debrided
and now is very clean and dry ulcer that was evaluated by the
skin nurse and felt that Xeroform would be the best treatment at
this time and the legs should be elevated on pillows to relieve
any pressure off of the heel for continual healing and
prevention or breakdown. The patient is in stable condition and
has been accepted to a rehab bed on postoperative day #20 and
will be discharged to the rehab facility in stable condition on
these following medications.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
EXACERBATION.
PROBLEM LIST: 1. POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA.
2. LUMBAR DISK DISEASE.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. COR PULMONALE.
5. TOBACCO SMOKER.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old woman
with a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the Emergency Ward
with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. She was
intubated for somnolence and worsening respiratory acidosis , and
transferred to the MICU. She had never had any intubations
previously. She is an active smoker with a long history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease who is followed by Dr. Jerald Fenner
Most recently , she was admitted on 8/5/92 for a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation which was treated with
aggressive bronchodilators. Her baseline ABG on discharge was
7.39 , pC02 51.1 , and a p02 of 66 with 91.3% 02 saturation. She had
a previous sleep apnea study on 5/25 which was negative. Her
most recent thyroid function tests on 8/6 revealed an FEV1 of 38%
and an FVC of 51% , with an FEV1/FVC of less than 80%. This was
felt to be consistent with a mixed obstructive/restrictive pattern.
She has been treated with Theophylline and Proventil as well as
home nebulizers , Lasix , and 02 overnight. She continues to smoke
as well as noted above. She has had frequent episodes of cough and
productive sputum as well as lower extremity edema. She now
presents with one to two weeks of increase in her postnasal drip ,
denying any change in her cough or sputum production although she
did note a slightly increased temperature. She began to become
more short of breath and was taken to the Emergency Ward by her
sister. There , she was found to be cyanotic with an 02 saturation
of 59%. Her first blood gas on 50% was 7.27 , pCO2 79 , p02 78%
saturation after one nebulizer treatment. Her peak flows after
three nebulizers were only 90. She began to become somnolent with
a repeat blood gas showing a pCO2 of 94 , and was therefore
intubated and transferred to the MICU. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Was
remarkable for ( 1 ) asthma/COPD , ( 2 ) polymyalgia rheumatica , ( 3 )
borderline hypertension , ( 4 ) lumbar disk disease , ( 5 ) psoriasis ,
( 6 ) right sided heart failure , ( 7 ) spinal stenosis , ( 8 ) sinusitis ,
( 9 ) obesity. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post cholecystectomy
in 1979 , status post back surgery. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Theo-Dur 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , KCL , Lodine 300
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Proventil nebulizers p.r.n. , supplemental 02 q.h.s.
ALLERGIES: SHE IS ALLERGIC TO SULFA WHICH CAUSES HER TO HAVE A
RASH. HABITS: She continues to smoke , and she has a history of 40
pack years. There is no alcohol use. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives
alone. She has two sons. She is assisted by her sister.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , she was an intubated , obese
female in no acute distress. Her blood
pressure was 140/70 , pulse 70-100 , and temperature of 101.6. HEENT
was unremarkable. Neck: Supple with no jugular venous distention.
Lungs revealed diffuse wheezes with an I:E ratio of 1:4. Heart:
Tachycardiac with a normal S1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. Breasts: No masses. Abdomen: Obese , mild tenderness to
deep palpation , normal bowel sounds. Extremities: 2+ edema to her
calves bilaterally , no clubbing. Pulses were 2+ dorsalis pedis
pulses. On neurological exam , she was awake but lethargic and
difficult to arouse , but was able to move all extremities. Her
reflexes were 2+ and symmetric bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride
98 , bicarbonate 36 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.6 ,
glucose 113. Her liver function tests were within normal limits.
Her white count was 9.96 , 76 polys , 15 lymphs. Her hematocrit was
47.6% with 265 , 000 platelets. The PT was 11.4 , and the PTT was
30.5. Theophylline level was 5.3. ABG's were as mentioned above.
Post intubation , ABG 7.45 , pCO2 41 , p02 57 , with 91% saturation.
The most recent echocardiogram in 1/11 revealed mild concentric
left ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular function.
The chest x-ray revealed an increased heart size with no
infiltrates. The urinalysis revealed too numerous to count white
blood cells and 4+ bacteria. Cultures eventually grew out E. coli.
EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with an axis of +8 , right bundle
branch block , inverted T's in V1 and V2 , but no significant change
compared with 11/1
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and continued on the
ventilator until 3/6/93. She was given aggressive
bronchodilator treatment via nebulizers , Albuterol and Atropent.
She was started on IV Solu-Medrol dose which was rapidly tapered on
a p.o. schedule. She also received two days of IV Ceftriaxone to
cover a possible tracheobronchitis. She was also continued on her
Ancef as well. Her urinary tract infection was treated via the
Ceftriaxone. She did well over the next two days and essentially
was ready for extubation on this regimen on 3/6/93. She was
watched overnight and did continue to do well , and was transferred
to the floor on 6/14/93. By this time , her 02 saturations were 92%
on two liters. She was afebrile , and her peak flows were improving
with continued Albuterol nebulizers and Atrovent inhaler. Her
polymyalgia rheumatica remained stable during her admission. There
was a question whether or not her urinary tract infection was
adequately treated as she had several repeat cultures growing 5 , 000
colonies of Staph aureus and one also growing diphtheroids. These
were clean catches. She had it repeated one more time as a clean
catch , and this was found to grow probable Pseudomonas species ,
with an exact speciation pending. This last culture on 5/17/93 was
associated with an urinalysis that was without white cells. Because
of this and because of the low cell count , I did not feel that it
was necessary to treat the positive culture until a straight cath
specimen was obtained. The patient was informed that if her
dysuria were to persist that she was to call Dr. Gigger immediately ,
but that otherwise , her urine was most likely noninfected. She
also received a sleep study on 1/16/93 which revealed that her
oxygen saturations dropped to 46% during REM sleep. This was at a
point when she appeared not to be breathing , and therefore had an
element of essential sleep apnea. She also during periods of
non-REM sleep alternated between breathing against an obstruction
and not breathing at all. This revealed that she also has a
component of obstructive sleep apnea as well. She was started on
Progesterone as an outpatient and will continue to be followed for
evaluation for possible nasal C-PAP. The patient was discharged on
8/19/93 with a continued good airflow and much fewer wheezes than
previously. There were no complications.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Progesterone 20 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Albuterol 0.5 cc in 2.5 normal saline q4
hours p.r.n. , Atrovent inhaler two puffs p.o. q4 hours , Prednisone

Discharge Date: 8/10/1996
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
IDENTIFICATION: The patient is a 71 year old gentleman with a
history of severe coronary artery disease who
presented with unstable angina with probable mesenteric ischemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Cardiac risk factors include a history
of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia ,
remote history of smoking , questionable positive family history ,
and no diabetes mellitus. The patient has had a history of
coronary artery disease , is status post multiple myocardial
infarctions. In the 1970s the patient had a myocardial infarction
number 1 and in 1992 he had his second myocardial infarction , non Q
wave MI , refused catheterization. ETT was done and he was treated
with Atenolol and Isordil. In 2/23/93 the patient had an anterior
myocardial infarction and subsequently had a V-tach , V-fib arrest ,
converted with 200 joules at Mid-ma Hospital and received TPA ,
heparin , Lidocaine , and his peak CPK value was 7975. Echo revealed
an ejection fraction of 20% with anterior apical akinesis , left
atrial enlargement. The course was complicated by post MI chest
pain. On 11/27/93 the patient was transferred to Rahfletchgreenesouth Rehabilitation Hospital Of Cardiac catheterization at that point revealed 90% LAD
lesion and 100% PDA lesion , 90% D1 lesion , and the patient had PTCA
of LAD to a remaining 40% lesion and D1 PTCA with 40% residual.
Post PTCA course was complicated by flash pulmonary edema and
anterior ST elevation which led to emergent cath which revealed a
70% LAD , 100% D1 lesion , and this re-occlusion was treated with
repeat PTCA of LAD and intra-aortic balloon pump. The patient was
given Captopril and Lasix for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Since then ,
the patient was medically managed and in his usual state of health
without any chest pain for the two years until about three days
prior to admission when patient had vague abdominal pain ,
epigastric ache , and cramp occurring intermittently , lasting for
4-6 hour episodes. Occasionally the patient was awaken from sleep.
He denied orthopnea , PND , edema. The patient's pain was similar
to but not identical to peptic ulcer disease pain. The patient
denied chest pain. On 5/25/96 , the patient was seen by Dr. Mcgray
of PVH . The patient continued to have abdominal pain. Patient
had CHF on examination. An EKG revealed new lateral T wave
changes. The patient was sent to Tanjuan Tialan Vition Hospital and there the
patient became diaphoretic , was short of breath , improved with
nitroglycerin and therefore was transferred to Bert Stern Medical Center
In the Emergency Room , the patient had shortness of breath , blood
pressure elevated to 210/110 , heart rate of 118 , continued to have
abdominal pain and development of chest pain typical of angina. He
received Lopressor , IV TNG , aspirin , no heparin secondary to
increased INR to 2.8 , and his shortness of breath subsequently
improved. Chest pain resolved. His EKG had T wave inversions in
V5 through V6.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Significant for coronary artery disease
as above. Status post multiple myocardial
infarctions. PTCA of LAD. 2. Peptic ulcer disease. 3.
Hypertension. 4. Hypercholesterolemia. 5. Status post
amputation of right third distal phalanx. 6. History of
nephrolithiasis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 3 mg q.h.s. , Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
q.day , Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor
20 mg p.o. q.day , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Nitro patch , and
sublingual nitroglycerin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with brother. Retired heavy
equipment operator. He smoked 15 pack years and
quit twenty years ago. Alcohol occasionally.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive coronary artery disease in two sisters
with myocardial infarctions.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature of 98 , heart rate of 72 , blood
pressure of 104/68 , respiratory rate of 16.
Oxygen saturation of 97%. HEENT examination revealed no JVD.
Cardiac examination showed regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur at left lower sternal border. Chest was
soft bibasilar crackles. Abdomen was soft , non-tender ,
nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. A ventral hernia was present
which was easily reducible. Extremities showed no cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema. Neuro examination was nonfocal. Rectal was
guaiac negative per the Emergency Ward.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium of 144 , potassium of 3.5. He had a
hematocrit of 43.6 and white blood count
of 9.8. LFTs were within normal range. PT of 20.2 , PTT of 38.2 ,
INR of 2.8. ABG on 100% face mask revealed 7.33 , 45 , 193 , 99.6% in
the Emergency Room. Abdominal ultrasound in the Emergency Room
revealed right renal stones , but no hydronephrosis , no gallbladder
stones , no evidence of triple A. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly ,
low volume lungs without clear evidence of CHF. EKG upon arrival
in the Emergency Ward revealed sinus tachycardia , T wave flattening
in AVL , T wave inversion V4 through V6 which were new , poor R wave
progression which was old. Pain free EKG revealed resolution of T
wave inversion in V4 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for the rule out MI
protocol. He actually ruled out for a myocardial
infarction with a CPK of 168 , CPK2 of 138 , and CPK3 of 147.
However on 11/10/96 his T wave inversion in V1 and V2 were noted to
be deeper on C set compared to A set. Subsequently that day the
patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema. As his IV heparin
and TNG were being turned down he became acutely short of breath
with bilateral crackles half way up the lung fields. He was found
to be in flash pulmonary edema which was treated with heparin , IV
TNG , and also Lasix. The patient did very well after that and his
troponin level at that point was 0. The patient's CPKs were
recycled and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction again.
His ABG at that point and during his acute episode of shortness of
breath was 7.37 , 43 , pO2 of 111 on 6 liters , and after diuresis he
was able to be on room air without any difficulty. It was
therefore decided for the patient to have cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on 10/4/96 which revealed
proximally occluded LAD , 60-70% lesion of OM1 , and 99% lesion of
proximal PDA , and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction with
extensive anterior apical akinesis and also inferior apical
akinesis. Based on this it was decided that the patient had three
vessel disease. In anticipation of surgical conservation the
patient had a ETT MIBI on 7/11/96 and he was able to go on modified
Bruce protocol 6 minutes. He stopped secondary to fatigue. He did
not achieve target heart rate. His maximum heart rate was 104 and
85% of the predicted value. Subsequently the MIBI results revealed
anterior wall and septum and apex to be nonfunctional , however the
patient had known transmural myocardial infarction in inferior wall
which revealed viable myocardium there and also lateral wall
nonfunctioning wall. These are the preliminary results. It was
decided for the patient to have maximal medical management prior to
consideration for surgery. The patient's Isordil dose was
increased while in hospital and his Coumadin was restarted.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,
Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg
p.o. t.i.d , Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.day , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. q.8h. ,
nitroglycerin 1/150 p.r.n. chest pain. Coumadin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s ,
and Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is being discharged in good
condition.
FOLLOW-UP: With Dr. Ayoub The patient is to be seen within one
week with Dr. Warmack of Gardmond Hospital for
Cardiology , and Dr. Bartolomeo of Thoracic Surgery per Dr. Ondrusek
recommendations. The patient has been chest pain free since
11/10/96 , since he had the episode of flash pulmonary edema. His
heparin was discontinued on 1/11/96. The patient remained chest
pain free with good oxygen saturation and was not short of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69-year-old female
with known coronary artery disease ,
CRF , and history of flash pulmonary edema , recently admitted to
Darnbo Hospital on 6/9/97 after sudden onset of shortness of breath
unrelieved by one sublingual nitroglycerin. This shortness of
breath awakened her from sleep. Her blood pressure in the
Emergency Room was 230/110 without EKG changes. She responded well
to IV Lasix and IV nitroglycerin , saturating at 99% on 100%
nonrebreather mask. Chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary
edema. Her blood pressure was stabilized on IV nitroglycerin with
resolution of her shortness of breath. She was ruled out for
myocardial infarction. The patient was also recently admitted one
month ago to Stonemep Medical Center for flash pulmonary edema without
evidence of myocardial infarction. Echo on admission showed 30%
ejection fraction with anteroapical and posterobasal hypokinesis.
Cardiac catheterization in January 1997 showed a 90% proximal RCA
lesion and diffuse distal LAD disease. During vigorous rehydration
following that cardiac catheterization , she developed recurrent
pulmonary edema requiring intubation from which she was weaned
following diuresis. Because her pulmonary edema was believed to be
ischemia related , she was transferred to the Ha Hospital for RCA angioplasty. On this admission , she denies any
chest pain , shortness of breath , or dizziness. She has three
pillow orthopnea , ankle edema. She denies any paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea with the exception of her current presentation. The
patient's coronary risk factors include diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , post menopausal status without
hormone replacement therapy , and history of tobacco use. Her
exercise tolerance is such that she develops shortness of breath
with walking one block or one flight of stairs. She reports having
to sit down at every other bench in the mall.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypercholesterolemia. Total cholesterol
266 down to 193. 2. Hypertension. 3.
Breast cancer status post left mastectomy seven years ago and
status post five years of Tamoxifen therapy. She has had no other
chemo or radiation treatment. 4. Depression. 5. Hypercalcemia ( no
alkalized syndrome ) 9/13 6. History of recurrent pneumonia. 7.
History of diverticulitis. 8. Glaucoma. 9. Non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus diagnosed one year ago , diet controlled. 10.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a history of pyelonephritis at age
three. 11. Mitral regurgitation. 12. Status post total abdominal
hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at age 40 , hormone
replacement therapy for five years which was then discontinued
secondary to her breast cancer. 13. Status post bilateral knee
replacement.
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. started three
weeks ago , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , Isordil 30 mg p.o. q.i.d. ,
hydralazine 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.day , Timoptic
0.25% one GTT OU b.i.d. , Serax 30 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia ,
and IV heparin at 1 , 300 units per hour.
ALLERGIES: Tagamet causes a rash and adhesive tape.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for a history of tobacco. She quit 17
years ago. She uses no alcohol and no IV drug
use. She lives with her husband in Lau and has six children.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her father died of stomach cancer. Mother , two
aunts , and sister have history of myocardial
infarction at ages greater than 60.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient has been following her weight since
her last discharge ( pulmonary edema ). She
reports a weight loss from 177 to 175 lb over the last couple of
days. She reports a 12 lb weight loss in the last month. She has
no complaints of dysuria or cough.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant female , resting
comfortably in bed. Her temperature was
98.5 , blood pressure 156/68 , pulse 78 , respirations 20 , and 95% on
two liters. There was no JVD. Carotids were 1+ without bruits , no
thyromegaly , and no lymphadenopathy. Lungs revealed right basilar
crackles. She was using accessory muscles for respirations. Heart
revealed regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2. There was a
II-III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the LSB. There was a III/VI
holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. There was
no S3 or S4. Her abdomen was slightly distended with no
hepatosplenomegaly. She was guaiac negative. She had 2+ femoral
pulses bilaterally without bruits and 2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
There was no ankle edema. Neurological examination was grossly
intact.
LABORATORY DATA: BUN was 59 , creatinine 3.9 , hematocrit 28.9 , and
MCV 82.3. Magnesium was 2.4. Chest x-ray from
outside hospital was consistent with pulmonary edema. EKG revealed
normal sinus rhythm at 81 , normal axis and intervals ( QT slightly
increased at 0.46 ) , LVH , LAE. There was T flattening in AVL.
There were no acute ST or T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient was much improved after
successful diuresis with improvement
of her pulmonary examination and no evidence of right sided
failure. She was saturating well on room air. Care was taken to
diurese slowly in order to present a prerenal insult. She remained
symptom free for the duration of her hospital course.
2. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: The patient denies ever having had any
chest pain , but had known anatomy with single vessel disease ( RCA ).
Her history is suggestive of possible silent ischemia consistent
with her diabetic status. Her anginal equivalent appears to be
shortness of breath. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization
on 6/2/97 with PTCA plus stent placement to her RCA with a good
result. She is on Ticlid for two weeks. Her blood pressure was
well controlled in her target range of 140-160 systolic blood
pressure on hydralazine , Lasix , and Lopressor. The day following
cardiac catheterization , her hematocrit and creatinine remained
stable at 30.9 and 3.7 , respectively. On 7/4/97 , her creatinine
increased to 4.2. This increase was thought to be due to a
combination of prerenal insult in addition to possible
dinephropathy. She was hydrated gently and her creatinine was
watched for the next two days , stabilizing in the 4.4 to 4.5 range.
3. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Etiology was unknown , possibly
secondary to diabetes mellitus or hypertensive nephropathy. She
has history of creatinine rises to high 3s and 4s during recent
hospitalizations. Hospital course is as described above. In
addition , Axid was changed to renal dosing ( q.day ) and the patient
was treated for a urinary tract infection. In reviewing the
hospital records , there is no evidence of previous work up for
renal artery stenosis. This patient with history and physical to
control blood pressures and flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
hypertension may benefit from further evaluation of possible renal
artery stenosis. This work up was deferred during this
hospitalization due to management of acute issues.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS: This was stable , diet controlled.
5. ANEMIA: The patient was worked up for her baseline low
hematocrit , found to have an iron deficiency anemia treated with
Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. Given her underlying renal failure ,
there may also be a renally driven component to her anemia and she
may benefit from Epogen as an outpatient.
The patient was discharged to home in stable condition to follow up
with Dr. Andre Smithe , her cardiologist , in two weeks , and her
primary care physician in one week based on previously scheduled
appointment.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.day , hydralazine 50 mg
p.o. q.i.d. , Isordil 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingual q. 5 minutes
times three p.r.n. chest pain , Timoptic 0.25% one drop OU b.i.d. ,
Axid 150 mg p.o. q.day , and Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. for two
weeks. Also , Niferex tablet 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to have her
CBC checked at two weeks and four weeks
given her Ticlid therapy.

secondary CHF p/w mild CHF flare. Home o2 requ 4-6L now increased to
7-8L. Here for some diruesis , goal hco3 should not exceed 35.
97% 6L , afebrile , bp150/80 L base decrease sounds with fine
rales 1+ pit edema.
**********************hospital course***************************
1. PULM: admitted with mild worsening of chronic hypoxia related to
restrictive lung disease , obesity hypoventilation and obstructive sleep
apnea. Her baseline home oxygen requirement in 5-6L by nasal cannula
along with nasal BiPAP at night 16/8. She had decompensated to 7-8Lnc
and was complaining of dyspnea , both of which resolved with iv lasix
and 2-3liters negative diuresis. She is chronically deconditioned and
obese and refused to go to a rehabilitation facility , even pulmonary
rehab.
2. CV: followed by Dr. Seling of cardiology; diuresed with iv lasix and
diamox with bicard between 30-35 during admission. No active ichemic i
ssue or arrhythmias noted during admission. Discharged on home
diuretic regimen of 80mg lasix po qd with instructed to take an extra
pill once if she feels like her ankles are swelling or she is
particularly short of breath and no phone her physician.
3. ID: CXR negative for infiltrate , no fever no cough and no evidence
of pneumonia. Ms. Boerner had her influenza vaccination this year
already.
4. Social: SW consulted , patient lives alone , has no support network
and is chronically noncompliant with medical and dietary
recommendations. Cardiac and pulmonary social work have both been
involved in her care in the past. PT consulted and recommended
pulmonary rehab , but patient refused. Her primary support is from an
internet friend who lives in Reve Ins and despite bargaining with staff
about which medicines to take and when to discharge her , she was well
enough to go on her scooter to visit ""friends"" in the hospital and get
high salt food from Connecticut She was discharged in stable condition with
oxygen back to her baseline levels of 96% on 5l nc and will follow up
with her pcp.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Continue to eat a low salt , low total fluid diet. Follow up with your
primary care physician , you cardiology and your hematologist as
necessary. There are no increased oxygen requirements at this time. If
you feel like your ankles are swelling or you are having trouble
breathing , please take one extra lasix pill and call your physician for
further instructions.

Discharge Date: 10/17/1997
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 76 year old woman with
asthma. Presenting problem was
shortness of breath. Problem list included anxiety , status post
cholecystectomy in 1988 , headaches , asthma , hypertension , vertigo ,
question of pneumonia in February 1996. Patient's cardiac risk
factors included a history of hypertension , she had no known
history of elevated cholesterol , she did not smoke , and had no
history of diabetes or family history of cardiac disease. She had
no prior myocardial infarction and no history of angina. The
patient did have a history of asthma with no prior hospitalizations
or steroid tapers. She did take p.o. Proventil at night and there
were no pulmonary function tests available on record. Two days
prior to admission , the patient noted sudden onset of inability to
sleep secondary to shortness of breath when lying down. The
patient tried her inhaler without relief of symptoms. She also
noted an intermittent nonproductive cough. The patient denied
fevers or chills. She reported that her symptoms did not improve
during the day and the night prior to admission , the patient noted
shortness of breath on exertion. She denied chest pain or chest
pressure. She had no diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting , or light
headedness. The patient presented to Bellmarle Medical Center
Emergency Department for persistent inability to sleep. On
evaluation in the Emergency Room , her blood pressure was 136/75
with a pulse of 124 , respiratory rate of 32 , and saturations of 94%
on room air. She was given nebulizers times three then 20 mg of
intravenous Lasix. She put out 600 cc of urine to that Lasix. The
Emergency Department then attempted to give her Verapamil 5 mg
times three to decrease her heart rate which was not effective.
The patient had no prior history of cardiac event. Her last
exercise test was in 1993. She went three minutes and five seconds
on the treadmill and stopped secondary to shortness of breath. Her
maximum heart rate was 130 with a maximum blood pressure of 190/80.
She had a baseline left bundle-branch block and therefore , her EKG
were not interpretable.
ALLERGIES: Patient had no known drug allergies.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Meclizine 25 mg t.i.d. , Proventil tablet 4 mg
p.o. q.h.s. , oxazepam 10 mg p.o. q.8h. ,
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d. , and Flexeril 10 mg p.o. q.8h.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Habits included that patient did not drink alcohol
and she did not smoke cigarettes. Patient lived
at home with her family who were very involved with her care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was an elderly Hispanic woman in no
acute distress. Vital signs included a
temperature of 98.2 , blood pressure 108/59 , pulse 101 , and
respiratory rates of 30 with saturations of 92% on three liters.
HEENT: Examination revealed a jugular venous pressure at 6 cm.
CHEST: Showed bilateral rales two thirds of the way up without
wheezes and no focal findings or egophony. CARDIAC: Examination
showed a regular rate and rhythm , tachycardic with a normal S1 and
S2 , no murmurs , and no S3 or S4. ABDOMEN: Showed a well healed
surgical scar , breath sounds present , no hepatosplenomegaly , and no
hepatojugular reflux. EXTREMITIES: Without edema , clubbing , or
cyanosis and she had 2+ symmetrical distal pulses. NEUROLOGICAL:
Examination was within normal limits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: SMA 7 was within normal limits with a BUN
of 15 and a creatinine of 1.0 , CBC showed
a white count of 9.45 , hematocrit of 36.5 , and platelets of 338.
CK was 110 and troponin was 0.0. Chest x-ray showed increased
heart size with bilateral increased interstitial markings
consistent with pulmonary edema and positive pulmonary vascular
redistribution. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 106 beats per
minute with normal intervals , an axis of negative 16 , a left
bundle-branch block , and no significant changes since 5/6/97.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for new onset congestive
heart failure. She was ruled out for myocardial
infarction. On the second day of hospitalization , she underwent an
exercise tolerance test MIBI on which she went four minutes and
eleven seconds on a modified Bruce protocol. She stopped secondary
to fatigue. She denied chest pain , there were no EKG changes , and
she had several bursts of nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia
with exercise. Nuclear images revealed mild fixed reduced uptake
in the inferior wall consistent with a small injury but no evidence
of ongoing ischemia. An echocardiogram was also performed that
revealed a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesis and an
ejection fraction of 15% to 20%. She had mild mitral calcification
with mild regurgitation , trace tricuspid regurgitation , and a
normal right ventricular size and function. It was determined that
the patient would benefit from afterload reduction and inatropy
given her poor ejection fraction. She was started on Captopril ,
Digoxin , and Isordil in addition to the Lasix she had received upon
presentation for her congestive heart failure. The patient
tolerated these medications well and maintained a systolic blood
pressure of approximately 100 without symptoms of orthostasis.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Proventil tablets 4 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Flexeril 10 mg p.o. q.8h. , Digoxin 0.0625 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 80 mg
p.o. q.d. , Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , meclizine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets taking one sublingually q.5 minutes
times three p.r.n. chest pain , Serax 10 mg p.o. q.8h. , K-Dur 20 mEq
p.o. q.d. , and Lisinopril 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with her primary care
physician , Dr. Rheaves , at Sharp Statepark Rehab in
Ston Dr. Jankoff will adjust her medications as
necessary and will arrange for an out-patient Holter monitor to
follow-up with nonsustained run of supraventricular tachycardia
during her exercise stress test.

OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Chest x-ray performed on 1/1/2006
by Freeman Ziesman showing mild pulmonary edema. Echocardiogram
performed on 1/1/2006 by Gavin Heltsley showing no significant
change from previous done 8/10/2003. Ejection fraction of 25% ,
left atrium 5 cm mildly enlarged , global hypokinesia , no obvious
thrombi , PA SBP 57 mmHg. EEG performed on 5/25/2006 by Pat Byford was consistent with mild encephalopathy of toxic ,
metabolic , traumatic , or other origins. No definitive , focal , or
epileptiform features. Previous EEG done on 9/17/2006 revealed
similar findings. Head CT on 5/25/2006 by Lanny Chiarito showed
prominent ventricles and sulci that appear appropriate for the
patient's age. No acute intracranial process.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted with an elevated
BNP and chest x-ray consistent with CHF flare , likely secondary
to UTI. On arrival to the floor , the patient was hemodynamically
stable and asymptomatic. EKG and one set of cardiac enzymes were
negative for cardiac ischemia and his home cardiac medications
were restarted. On examination , the patient had elevated JVP and
edema , suggesting that he was volume overloaded. The patient
responded to diuresis with torsemide 5 mg IV and metolazone 2.5
mg by mouth. He was switched to his home dose of torsemide 30 mg
p.o. and was euvolemic on discharge. Echocardiogram was
performed on 5/25/2006 to rule out structure etiologies for CHF
flare. Results showed no significant change from previous echo
done on 6/27/2006. The patient was on telemetry during the
hospital course and was noted to have atrial fibrillation with
premature ventricular contractions. He remained asymptomatic and
hemodynamically stable throughout the hospital course.
2. ID: UTI contributing to his CHF flare and MS changes.
Urinalysis was positive and the outside hospital reported
Gram-negative rods. The patient was continued on a 10-day course
of p.o. Levaquin. TP-IgG was negative.
3. Pulmonary: Chest x-ray on admission was consistent with mild
interstitial pulmonary edema. The patient remained asymptomatic
with no oxygen requirement. The patient responded well to
diuretic therapy for CHF flare.
4. Neurology: The patient's altered mental status was thought
to be secondary to urinary tract infection without metabolic
causes. B12 , folate , TSH , and T4 were within normal limits.
TP-IgG was negative. Iron was slow with small hypochromia on
smear , suggesting mild iron deficiency. EEG was also performed
on 5/25/2006 as this patient displayed fluctuations in cognitive
function that could be related to seizure activity. EEG was
nondiagnostic for epileptiform features. The patient was started
on Keppra 500 mg twice a day. His mental status appeared to be at baseline at
time of discharge
5. Renal: Creatinine 1.4 , baseline creatinine was monitored
during diuresis. Creatinine trended down to 1.3 on discharge.
Gross hematuria was present upon arrival to floor secondary to
patient pulling on catheter in his altered mental state. Bladder
scan ruled out obstruction and the bladder was irrigated to
remove clots. As the patient's mental status improved , he no
longer pulled on the catheter and the hematuria resolved. He
continued to have some bleeding around the catheter secondary to
BPH and the trauma from manipulation of the catheter.
6. Wounds: The patient had a nonhealing ulcer on the left
Achilles , recently seen at Usccaialt Hospital by Dr.
Kampmann , Plastic Surgery. He saw the patient and recommended
Panafil spray for the wound and frequent dressing changes. The
patient will follow up with Dr. Ousley as an outpatient.
7. GI: Distended abdomen with question of ascites. LFTs
returned within normal limits , no indication for ultrasound.
8. Hematology: Hematuria as described above which resolved with
improved mental status. The patient's hematocrit remained stable
throughout the hospital course. The patient has a history of
elevated INR , resistant to p.o. and subcutaneous vitamin K.
Records from Eym Medical Center suggest that the patient has factor
VII deficiency. The patient had no episodes of uncontrollable
bleeding or symptoms suggesting anticoagulative state.
9. Endocrine: Continued the patient's home dose of Synthroid.
Diabetes type 2 covered Lantus 10 units and insulin aspart
sliding scale.
10: Fen: Potassium/magnesium scales. cardiac ,
low salt diet.
11. Prophylaxis: Proton pump inhibitor , Lovenox.

Discharge Date: 5/21/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
OTHER PROBLEMS: 1. Poorly controlled hypertension.
2. Diabetes.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Fjeseth is a 62-year-old woman with
cardiac risk factors of hypertension ,
diabetes , a positive family history , and coronary disease
documented by a prior myocardial infarction who presented with
increased leg swelling , a 21 lb weight gain over the last three
months and who was seen in Clinic on February , 1996 , by Dr.
Glod , and was admitted for management. She had a myocardial
infarction in 1981 and , in September 1995 , she had a three vessel CABG
which included a LIMA graft to the LAD and two saphenous vein
grafts to the OM and to the PDA. In April 1995 , her postoperative
course had been complicated by loculated left pleural effusion
which required bronchoscopy and a left thoracentesis , as well as a
thorascopic lysis of pleural adhesions , some decortication and
drainage of effusions. At this time , she had also been dyspneic on
exertion along with shortness of breath at rest. On April , 1995 ,
she had an echo which showed an EF of 59% , a mildly dilated left
ventricle , abnormal septal motion secondary to left bundle branch
block , and minimal mitral regurgitation , and mild mitral
calcification above the normal right ventricular size and function.
A Bovie study was also performed and was negative. She also
presented with some biventricular failure and diuresis was
attempted , as well as alkaloid reduction. Over the past two
months , she had increased lower extremity edema , and she gained
approximately 21 lb since February , 1995. She has been quite
active and not limited. However , the edema has been her most
limiting factor. Three nights prior to admission , she had dyspnea
on exertion and some proximal maximal dyspnea , but she had no chest
pain and compression boots were attempted to try to alleviate some
of the edema. She had no orthopnea. She claims to have no dietary
indiscretions , no fevers , no sweats , no chills , no coughs , no chest
pain , no abdominal pain , and no bright red blood per rectum , but
she was more fatigued. On February , 1996 , she was seen in Clinic
by Dr. Denet and was seen to have increased leg edema and
increased dyspnea on exertion with climbing stairs. An echo was
performed and showed decreased left ventricular function within an
EF of about 40% , decreased down from an EF of 59% documented in
April 1995. Her CKs were flat an troponin I level later documented
0.4 , which was negative. Echo report also showed some inferior
posterior hypokinesis , as well as significant tricuspid
insufficiency at 3.2 meters per second , which suggested PA
pressures of about 41 mmHg. The patient was subsequently admitted
for management of her congestive heart failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , status post
myocardial infarction in 1981 , hypertension
with systolics in the 200s , which has been difficult to control ,
diabetes for which she has been on insulin. She has a history of
an amaurosis fugax in September 1995 and was started on Coumadin in January
1995. She has a history of the loculated pleural effusions and a
history of TIA while being on Coumadin. She also has a history of
kidney stones.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: CABG times three in 1995 , right CEA in
1993 , and right mastoid surgery.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin and Ceclor which cause a rash.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5

FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for mother who had a myocardial
infarction at age 40 and 60. Father died of a
myocardial infarction at age 40.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a rather obese woman ,
totally edematous , who was slightly short of
breath while talking. Her vitals were 97.3 , 64 , blood pressure
211/100 , respiration rate 20 , and oxygen saturation of 96% on room
air. Her neck examination was significant for a jugular venous
pulse that went up to the angle of her jaw at 30 degrees. Her
carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally showing no bruits , but there was
a right CEA scar. Her chest examination was significant for few
crackles at bilateral bases. Cardiac examination showed a normal
S1 , S2 , but with a faint S3. Abdominal examination had a positive
fluid wave , positive bowel signs , and she was tender in right upper
quadrant. Extremities showed 3+ pitting edema to knees
bilaterally. DP pulse was 1+ bilaterally and femoral pulses were
unable to be palpated. Her weight , at the time of admission , was
233 lb.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory values were unremarkable at the time
of admission. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm of
64 , left bundle branch block , and there was no change essentially
since September 1995. Chest x-ray , on admission , showed increased
interstitial markings bilaterally with perhaps a slight pleural
effusion. There was also some left lower lobe scarring and there
was an elevated left hemidiaphragm , which was consistent with
increased initial pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix for the
first three hospital days , during which she lost
approximately 17 lb. She was then switched to p.o. Lasix on
hospital day four , and continued to diurese. She was placed on
strict fluid and diet restrictions throughout her stay. Her blood
pressure was controlled with a diuretic , as well as with a beta-1
blocker and ACE inhibitor and a small amount of nitrate. Her
calcium blocker was discontinued while we were trying to diurese
her. Her blood sugars ran low with her normal 35 units of NPH
dose , so the dose was held for a couple days and she was controlled
an CZI sliding scale and was resumed on 20 units of NPH. By
hospital day five , the patient was stable on the staple regimen.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , NPH 20 units subcutaneous
q.a.m. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.6h. ,
nitroglycerin NTG 1/150 sublingual q.5 minutes times three p.r.n.
chest pain , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , KCl slow release 32 mEq p.o. b.i.d. ,
ofloxacin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. times three days.
COMPLICATIONS: The patient had irritation of her bladder from her
Foley catheter and produced some bloody urine and
then upon discontinuing the Foley catheter had some burning of her
urine for which a urinalysis was performed. She was placed on
ofloxacin for three days.
DISPOSITION: The patient was stable upon discharge.
FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow up with Dr. Mancha on January ,
1996 at 12:30 p.m. during a scheduled appointment. She
is also to follow up with Kelley Tallie , her nurse at Ver Hospital to
follow up on her blood sugar control. The patient will also have a
VNA sent to see her three times a week for vital signs check ,
weight medical , pharmaceutical compliance , and her weights will be
called in to Dr. Heglar She should also improve upon her
physical therapy and increase her abilities for ambulation.

p.o. q.day , Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco or alcohol use reported.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98 , blood pressure 128/70 ,
pulse 75. Obese middle aged female in no
acute distress. HEENT was atraumatic , normocephalic. Neck was
supple with no bruits. Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam showed distant heart sounds ,
irregularly irregular. Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended ,
morbid obesity. Normal active bowel sounds. Extremities showed a
healing right shin superficial wound , 1+ edema bilaterally.
Neurologic exam showed mental status , orientation , attention and
language intact. Speech was low , but not clearly hoarse. Cranial
nerves right pupil irregular but reacts 2.5 to 2. Left pupil
irregular status post iridectomy. Visual fields intact. Right eye
slightly adducted at rest without diplopia. Mild decreased
abduction and adduction on the right without diplopia , even on
extreme gaze. No nystagmus. Unable to converge fully with the
right eye. No facial droop. Cranial nerves otherwise intact. Gag
present. Able to swallow without difficulty. Motor showed normal
tone and power to confrontation , symmetric bulk , ? slight slowing.
No clear pronator drift. Tendon reflexes trace brachialis , 2+
biceps , no triceps , trace knee reflexes , no ankle jerks. Equivocal
toes bilaterally. Sensation is notable for decreased vibration
sense , left greater than right at the toes , intact position sense
symmetric. Symmetric exam to temperature and light touch. ?
cerebellar exam with mild dysmetria on finger to nose on the left ,
Romberg stable with slight swaying to the left. Gait slow with
small steps , but fairly steady.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Labs showed sodium 143 , potassium 4.6 ,
chloride 100 , bicarb 29 , BUN 19 ,
creatinine 1.1 , glucose 67 , white blood cell count 8 , hematocrit
36 , platelets 222 , PT 17 , INR 2.3 , PTT 32. EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with no acute changes noted. Chest x-ray showed mild
cardiomegaly , no congestive heart failure or infiltrate. Head CT
showed movement artifact with no obvious CVA , ? hypodensity in the
right upper pons but likely artifact.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with symptoms of
vertical diplopia and unsteadiness/imbalance ,
falling to the left , with improvement overnight. Patient still had
an abduction defect with her right eye on the morning after
admission and mild leftward gait unsteadiness , but her vertical
diplopia had resolved. The patient was continued to be monitored.
Her blood pressure was followed. Patient was kept on Coumadin.
Patient was scheduled for an open air MRI , given her significant
size. Patient was scheduled for an open MRI at the MRI in
Well Deh Ny On 3 of August , patient underwent MRI with particular
interest in visualization of the posterior fossa. No acute infarct
or hemorrhage was noted on MRI MRA. The patient was continued on
her Coumadin. Coumadin had been increased from admission dose of
17 mg to 18 mg p.o. q.p.m. Initially , her INR went down slightly
on 3 of August to 1.7 , likely secondary to a missed dose earlier in the
week. On 17 of July , patient reported feeling back to her baseline of
one week ago. Patient denied any new symptoms. Patient denied
further imbalance or vertical diplopia. Patient was thought to
have had a likely small vessel cerebral infarct and , although no
stroke was demonstrated on MRI , involvement of patient's left side
suggested a cerebral lesion in the brain stem in order to explain
the diplopia. Patient probably had a very small vessel stroke/TIA.
Patient has known major risk factors for both small vessel and
large vessel and cardioembolic disease. Patient was discharged to
continue further risk factor modification in the outpatient clinic.
Patient is to continue her cardiac medical regimen. Patient will
continue with Coumadin for a goal INR of 2-3 for her chronic atrial
fibrillation. Patient was discharged on 5 of March She was
instructed to call SMER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL on Monday morning to schedule an
appointment with her primary care physician within the next 10
days. Patient is discharged in stable condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amitriptyline 50 mg p.o. q.day , Colace
100 mg p.o. q.day , Lasix 120 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.day , diltiazem CD 180 mg p.o. q.day ,

Discharge Date: 2/3/1996
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND
MIXED MITRAL VALVE DISEASE
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Reda is an 87 year-old
woman with a history of coronary
artery disease , mitral regurgitation and multiple sclerosis. She
has been complaining of chest pain and pressure on exertion as well
as dyspnea on exertion associated with limitation of activity and
increasing sublingual nitroglycerin use for the six to seven months
prior to admission. Of note , the patient developed atrial
fibrillation , atrial flutter back in October , 1995. An
echocardiogram at that time demonstrated an ejection fraction of
40% , inferior hypokinesis , moderate mitral regurgitation , and a
left atrial size of 6.1 centimeters. The patient required
hospitalization in October , 1996 , for congestive heart failure. She
returned to the hospital in February , 1996 , with complaints of chest
pain at rest and shortness of breath. She was ruled out for
myocardial infarction at Tol Hospital and transferred to
Ana Vinerl Hospital , where she refused cardiac
catheterization. Echocardiogram at that time demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 45% , inferior , posterior and anterior septal
hypokinesis , mild to moderate mitral stenosis and moderate mitral
regurgitation. Again , there was left atrial enlargement measured
at 6.1 centimeters. The patient returned home and was doing well
until February , 1996 , when she developed headache , chest pain and
shortness of breath. She again presented to Beth's Community Memorial Hospital where
she was found to be in acute pulmonary edema. She was stabilized
and transferred to Crithouse County Medical Center for further
management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
status post anterior myocardial infarction.
Mitral regurgitation. Mitral stenosis. Atrial fibrillation.
Hypertension. Hypothyroidism. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Peptic ulcer disease. Normocytic anemia. Polymyalgia rheumatica.
History of left humeral fracture. She is status post appendectomy ,
cholecystectomy , and laser therapy for retinal disease of the right
eye.
ALLERGIES: Erythromycin , which causes vomiting and hypertension ,
as well as to sulfa drugs which cause vomiting. She
has a possible allergy to penicillin as well.

SOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and retired. She has no smoking
or alcohol history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is in atrial fibrillation at a rate of
83. Her blood pressure is 100/60 and is 95%
on room air. HEENT: Significant for upper and lower dentures
without any oropharyngeal lesions. NECK: Supple with 2+ carotid
pulses and no bruits. LUNGS: Bibasilar crackles. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Irregularly irregular rate and rhythm. Normal S1/S2. III/VI
holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla. ABDOMEN:
Soft , nontender , obese. EXTREMITIES: Without cyanosis , clubbing
or edema. There are varicosities in bilateral lower extremities
with minimal varicosities over the thigh areas. There is bilateral
knee swelling. Pedal pulses are 1+ bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL:
Nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: BUN is 35 , creatinine 1.5. White blood cell count
8.3. Hematocrit 32. PT 11.9 , PTT 28.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Jeffganlanda Py Docweli Skiffle Community Hospital Cardiology Service , where she
was maximized medically. The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on January , 1996 , where she was noted to have
right coronary artery stenosis in the mid portion which was 50% and
distally had 80%. Finally , 90% with subtotal occlusion after the
posterior descending artery. The left anterior descending artery
had 40% stenosis after diagonal 1. Diagonal 1 itself had 90%
stenosis in the mid portion. The left circumflex had a 70%
stenosis at the mid portion and another 70% stenotic area at the
distal portion. Left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated
at 45%. Inferior hypokinesis was noted as was 3-4+ mitral
regurgitation. Right atrial pressures were 6 , right ventricle was
52/10 , pulmonary artery 52/22 , with mean of 33 , pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure was 27 and left ventricle was 160/16. The patient
was evaluated by the Cardiac Surgical Service for coronary artery
bypass grafting and replacement of her mitral valve. On March , 1996 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four with saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal one , saphenous vein graft to left anterior
descending artery , diagonal one and to left anterior descending
artery. She also had mitral valve replacement with 31 millimeter
Hancock. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred postoperatively to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit on
nitroglycerin , Dopamine drip. She was weaned to extubate without
difficulty. She was restarted on Captopril and digoxin as well as
Coumadin. The patient had minimal response to diuretics ,
associated with a rise in her creatinine to 1.9. The Captopril was
discontinued and the creatinine returned again to 1.3. Although
the chest x-ray demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions , the
patient did not require aggressive diuresis initially as she had
excellent oxygenation on room air. Of note the patient was not
restarted on Lopressor as her blood pressures remained in the
90-100 range. The patient was , however , started on her prednisone
at 5 milligrams p.o. q.d. as well as on her Synthroid. Chest tubes
and invasive monitoring were discontinued early in the patient's
hospital course and she was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number four. The patient was followed by
physical therapy and occupational therapy for progression of her
mobility. She was determined to benefit from intensive
rehabilitation at a facility.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was ambulating with
assistance. She was tolerating a regular
diet. She was seen to be in atrial fibrillation but ventricular
response was well controlled in the 60s to 70s. Of note , her
electrocardiogram demonstrated persistent right bundle branch block
as well as a left anterior fascicular block. Although the patient
had been receiving more than her normal doses of Coumadin , her INR
had not reached the therapeutic range. She was , however ,
therapeutic on heparin.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to a facility for
intensive conditioning and rehabilitation. There she
will continue to receive her heparin until she is therapeutic on
her Coumadin. Coumadin dosing will be handled by primary care
doctor , Dr. Corey Updegraff , or a physician at the rehabilitation
center. Dr. Turks 's number is 250-940-9571. The goal INR is 2
to 2.5. The patient will also require follow-up chest x-rays as
prior to discharge , her chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural
effusions which were small and were not compromising her
respiration at all.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol #3 one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h.
p.r.n. pain; digoxin 0.125 milligrams p.o.
q.d.; Colace 100 milligrams p.o. t.i.d. while taking Tylenol #3;
Lasix 80 milligrams p.o. q.d. to be continued initially but may be
discontinued at the discretion of the primary care or cardiology
physicians , pending the resolution of the pleural effusions and her
respiratory status; Synthroid 150 micrograms p.o. q.d. The patient
will require thyroid function tests in four weeks. Multivitamin
one tablet p.o. q.d.; Coumadin , dose to be determined by the
patient's INR , again the goal is 2 to 2.5. The patient received 4
milligrams on September , and 3 milligrams on September , and her
INR on September is 1.3. Axid 150 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.; K-Dur
10 mEq p.o. q.d. , potassium will also need to be monitored while
she is on the Lasix; intravenous heparin 800 units per hour with a
PTT goal of 50-60. The patient's PTT today on this dosing is 54.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient should follow-up with Dr. Kale in four to
six weeks , with Dr. Nicklas in two weeks , and with Dr.
Etheredge in one to two weeks.

ATTENDING: SID GIL KIJOWSKI MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , the patient is a
76-year-old woman with coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft in 1992 who was recently admitted
with non ST elevation MI/congestive heart failure at which time
catheterization revealed an increased wedge with decreased
patency in both venous grafts and a patent LIMA graft with
collaterals. The patient has an extensive past medical history
of hypercholesterolemia , chronic renal insufficiency , insulin
dependent diabetes , coronary artery disease status post multiple
MI , CABG , hypertension , degenerative joint disease , CVA , gout ,
schizoaffective disorder , tardive dyskinesia and hypothyroidism.
At her baseline she has been staying at the Wrangcon Ronhomar Memorial Hospital and on
admission was complaining of chest pressure since waking , similar
to the pressure she felt during a prior admission. She had a
certain amount of shortness of breath , some nausea , two episodes
of vomiting and her symptoms were not responsive to nitroglycerin
tablets at the Harpa Vensports Center The patient came to the Ter Health Emergency Department where she reported that her
chest pressure had resolved. She was treated with IV TNG. In
the Emergency Department she was also treated with Lopressor ,
aspirin , IV trinitroglycerin and was heparinized. The patient
then pulled out the lines. Her admission vitals were significant
for a blood pressure of 180/90. The patient had a heart rate of
86 , was afebrile and was breathing at 100% at 2 liters. She had
an elevated JVP , had clear sounding lungs , trace edema and at the
left upper sternal border and left lower sternal border a
systolic ejection murmur II-III/VI was heard with S1 and S2.
Admission labs were significant for an elevated creatinine of
2.0. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient had elevated
platelets from a baseline of 30 to 80 to 673 on admission , a
white count of 9.3 , hematocrit of 35. EKG was notable for a Q3
which had been seen on a prior EKG. T-wave inversions also seen
on a prior EKG. The patient had an echo on 7/4 which showed
concentric LVH with an EF of 30-35% , posterolateral and inferior
akinesis was also seen. A calcified aortic valve with trace AI
and mild MR was seen. On 10/19 , the patient had catheterization
which showed that her circulation was right dominant with an LAD
90% and 100% lesions , left circumflex with 100% lesion , RCA with
100% lesions. She had an SVG to PDA graft with 100% lesion , SVG
to circumflex graft with 85% lesion stented to 10% at that time.
She had a LIMA to LAD graft which was patent , and she had lots of
collaterals. The right heart cath was significant for a wedge of
39 and a PA of 75/34 and right atrial pressure of 14 and a
cardiac index of 1.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By system ,
1. Ischemia: The patient was initially treated with aspirin ,
beta blockers , statin , Plavix , Heparinized and was ruled out with
enzymes. On the first day of hospitalizations , the patient's
heparin was stopped , the patient's IV trinitroglycerin was
stopped as well. The patient was started on nadolol and that
dose was increased to 80 q.day which the patient tolerated well
and seemed to control the patient's blood pressure and heart rate
reasonably well. The patient's attending felt that the patient
was a poor candidate for catheterization and other interventions
and would not benefit significantly from it. The symptoms the
patient was having was similar she was having during a prior
hospitalization which had ended just two days before this
admission. It was felt that her nausea , vomiting and chest
pressure were probably noncardiac in nature. The only change in
the patient's cardiac medications at the time of discharge is an
increase in nadolol to 80 mg q.day.
Rhythm: The patient's rhythm was monitored on telemetry for most
of her stay during this hospitalization. Significant events were
not observed.
Pump: The patient was continued at her regular dose of
outpatient medications which seemed to be effective. The patient
had multiple complaints of chest pain/pressure during her
hospitalization which resulted in periodic examinations and EKGs.
All of these workups were negative.
2. GI: On 10/26 it was noted that the patient had an increased
white count of 16 , 000. Also on exam on that day it was noted
that the patient had marked right upper quadrant abdominal
tenderness and fullness. She was not tender anywhere else in her
abdomen. Abdominal exam was also significant for a central mass
representing an umbilical hernia. At that time , General Surgery
consult was called. Lipase and amylase were sent off. They were
negative. Liver function tests were also in the normal range at
that time. Surgery felt that the patient was a poor surgical
candidate given her comorbidities at that time but did recommend
a cholecystectomy in the future. They recommended initial
antibiotic course of amp , Levo and Flagyl which she was started
on. They also recommended making the patient NPO treated her
with Pepcid and giving her adequate IV hydration. The major
intervention they suggested was a cholecystectomy tube by
Interventional Radiology which was placed on the night of
3/16/04. On 9/24 , the patient's white count was down to 10 with
a Tmax of 100 , and at the time of discharge the patient had a
white count in the normal range around 7 and was also afebrile.
Surgery followed the patient during her stay in the hospital as
did Interventional Radiology. Bile was sent out for culture
which showed yeast as well as a gram stain which showed gram
positive cocci. The patient's antibiotics were switched to
Vancomycin , Levo and Flagyl. Initially the Vancomycin and Flagyl
were given IV and the Levo was given p.o. One day prior to
discharge , the patient's Flagyl was switched to p.o. and on the
day of discharge the Vancomycin was stopped after the patient had
received seven days of Vancomycin. The patient will be
discharged on Flagyl p.o. and Levo p.o. The patient was also
started no Fluconazole 100 to treat the yeast that was noted in
her bile cultures. The IR drain will need to be in the patient's
gallbladder for a minimum of six weeks or until the patient has
her elective cholecystectomy which will be scheduled at a later
date.
3. ID: The patient is colonized with MRSA and appropriate
precautions were taken and the patient was also noted to have an
infection in her gallbladder and was treated for it as such.
4. Pain: The patient was treated for abdominal pain during her
stay in the hospital with Demerol and also with Morphine.
5. Psychiatry: The patient was seen by Psychiatry on admission
to help manage her agitation and delirium. They did a
preliminary assessment of the patient. The patient did show
certain signs of agitation and multiple code grays had to be
called on the patient for difficult behavior , though the patient
was never in danger of truly hurting herself or others.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Cardiac chest pain.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Cholecystitis now resolved.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: ASA 325 , Colace 100 b.i.d. , Lasix 80
b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale , Levoxyl 175 , nadolol 80 , Lipitor
80 q.h.s. , Lantis 18 units , Diovan 80 , levofloxacin 500 every 24
hours to complete a 14 day course , Fluconazole 100 to complete a
14 day course , Flagyl 500 t.i.d. to complete a 14 day course ,
Plavix 75 , famotidine 20 b.i.d. , iron 325 q.day.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: DYSPNEA ON EXERTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Cabaniss is a 70-year-old woman with
a history of yellow nail syndrome ,
hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes ,
who has had multiple admissions since October 2001. The first was
an admission to an outside hospital from 5/25/01 - 11/20/01.
At that time , she had increased shortness of breath , and was
diagnosed with bilateral pleural effusions and a pericardial
effusion. She had a pericardial window and 600 cc were drained
from her pericardium , as well as pleural effusions drained. She
was discharged at that time with a diagnosis of congestive heart
failure , secondary to cor pulmonale. The second admission was
from 8/28/01 - 8/10/01 at the Aen Medical Center . At that time , she had
increased lower extremity edema. She was diuresed during that
admission , and again her pleural effusions were tapped. An
echocardiogram at that time revealed mild LVH , an ejection fraction
of 55-60% , no wall motion abnormalities and a moderate-large
pericardial effusion with fibrinous strands.
A catheterization of her left and right heart revealed a right
atrial pressure of 5 , an RV pressure of 45/11 , PA pressures of
38/18 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , LV pressure
was 127/14. There was no constrictive pericardial disease or
restrictive cardiomyopathy. She also had no malignant cells in her
pleural effusion , which was exudated. ANCA , ANA , SPEP were
negative. She also had a renal ultrasound that was without mass or
hydronephrosis , 24 hour urine collection with decreased protein.
The third admission was at Beysa Dward Hospital from 11/15/01 - 1/16/01 , for
increasing shortness of breath and increasing lower extremity
edema. At that time she was diuresed , found to be iron deficient.
She had bilateral thoracentesis , which revealed exudative
effusions. PFTs revealed a FEV1 of .9 , 40% of predicted , an FVC of
1.26 , 43% of predicted , an FEV1/FVC ratio of 93% , a TLC of 2.07 ,
40% of predicted , and a DLCO of 8.42 , also 40% of predicted. She
was ruled out for TB with serial ASBs during this admission.
She was also diagnosed with yellow nail syndrome at that time ,
consisting of the clinical syndrome of recurrent pleural effusions ,
lymphedema and yellow fingernails. She was started on high dose
Vitamin E , and evaluated by CT surgery for a possible pleurodesis.
However , she was sent home at that time with an increased dose of
diuretics.
Since her discharge in July , she has been aggressively diuresed ,
but the diuretics were stopped secondary to hyperkalemia. In September
2001 , she was found to have a 10 pound weight gain and was
restarted on Lasix. Over the week prior to admission , she has had
increasing dyspnea on exertion. She has baseline shortness of
breath and orthopnea , but her orthopnea has also worsened. Her
weight at discharge in July was 208 , and on admission she
currently weighs 238 , and was 231 pounds a month prior to
admission. She denies wheezing , but does have a chronic cough with
white sputum. She has had some substernal chest pain that is sharp
with dyspnea on exertion , which lasts for awhile without radiation.
She also has increasing lower extremity edema. In the emergency
department , she was found to be afebrile , heart rate 103 ,
respiratory rate 24 , blood pressure 95/41 and satting 91% on 2
liters. She was given Albuterol and Atrovent nebs without
improvement and Lasix 160 mg IV with a 600 cc diuresis.

SUMMARY: This is a 70-year-old woman with history of hypertension ,
diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , home 02
requirement and yellow nail syndrome. She was admitted with
increasing dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea and a weight gain over
the past week prior to admission. She has most likely had a
failure of home diuretics , and needed to have her effusions tapped
along with some definitive therapy for her yellow nail syndrome in
terms of recurrent pleural effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Pulmonary. We initially diuresed Ms. Jowell
with IV Lasix , along with Diuril. She had brisk
diuresis overnight , but was still short of breath the next day. On
hospital day #2 , we did a thoracentesis on her right side and were
able to remove 1.5 liters of clear , yellowish fluid. The fluid was
sent for cytology , as well as chemistries and returned as an
exudative effusion with predominant lymphocytes. The cytology was
negative for any malignant cells. The pulmonary team was
consulted , who decided that she would benefit from a pleurodesis to
prevent effusions from recurring. We consulted thoracic surgery ,
who requested a CT scan after a thoracentesis to assess her lungs
for evidence of malignancy.
CT scan was done on 9/19/01 , but due to atelectasis and having to
do the study without IV contrast , there were areas in her right and
left lungs that appeared nodular or opacified and could have been
malignancies. CT surgery also requested cardiac clearance before
any definitive surgical therapy was done due to new onset SVT. We obtained a
stress MIBI. On 9/4/01 , she was taken to the operating room for surgery
of the right chest. At that time , Dr. Women , the cardiothoracic
surgeon took biopsies of her pleura , which were reportedly
thickened and yellow. She also took a wedge biopsy of the right
lower lobe. Those biopsies have returned , and revealed mild
nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis with chronic bronchiolitis.
The diaphragm was also biopsied , and was determined to be lymphoid
tissue in a fibrous tissue fragment. She had a chest tube placed
at the time of operation and tolerated that well. However , after that
procedure , she was deemed unstable by the PACU team and was
admitted to MICU overnight. She extubated without problems and
remained on a few liters of oxygen overnight , with oxygen
saturations in the 90%. She was readmitted to the medicine team
on the following day , 8/28/01. Overall , she tolerated that
procedure well. Her chest tube that was placed on the right side
did not drain much fluid over the next few days. However , the
pleural effusion on the left side , did increase in size and we did
a thoracentesis on 8/28/01. We removed 1 liter of turbid ,
yellowish brown fluid. The chemistries revealed a lymphocyte and
macrophage predominance and the cytology is still pending at this
time. As her chest tube was not draining much fluid , the thoracic
surgery team decided to pleurodese her with doxycycline , which has
shown to be effective in yellow nail syndrome in patient's 70% of
the time. The pleurodesis was on 3/29/01. She tolerated this
procedure well , and had little chest tube drainage over the next 48
hours. The chest tube was pulled on 6/2/01.
Mrs. Musson 's shortness of breath was much improved after the
initial thoracentesis on the right , and she is currently on her
home oxygen requirement of 2 liters , satting in the mid-90%. The
plan is for her to see Dr. Colasante in 2 weeks and also have a
follow-up chest x-ray. At that time , Dr. Ostermann will determine if
there is fluid reaccumulating on the right after the pleurodesis.
She can then have a repeat pleurodesis on the right , or an initial
pleurodesis on the left.
2. Cardiovascular. Mrs. Blan was tachycardic on admission , and
continued to be tachycardic throughout the admission. She was
initially diuresed with IV Lasix and Diuril , and was probably over
diuresed , a total of 2-3 liters over a number of hours overnight.
On hospital day #2 , she was found to be tachycardic with rates in
the 140s-150s and atrial fibrillation. She converted back to
normal sinus rhythm with 3 doses of IV calcium channel blockers and
a Diltiazem drip. She was then maintained on Diltiazem SR 60 mg PO
b.i.d. throughout the admission and remained in normal sinus
rhythm. However , her tachycardia was noted to be multifocal HL
tachycardia during her MICU admission. At the time of admission ,
we did a pulsus which was only 8 mmhg. She had a bedside
echocardiogram to rule out a pericardial effusion , which revealed a
trace pericardial effusion. She also had a dobutamine MIBI for
cardiac clearance for the cardiothoracic surgical procedure. Her
heart rate increased from 107-129 , and the blood pressure decreased
from 115/70 - 110/70 at peak stress. The clinical response to
dobutamine was non-ischemic , the blood pressure response was
normal , and the EKG response to dobutamine was non-ischemic. There
were no definite regional perfusion defects seen on the stress or
rest images. However , only planer images could be obtained , due to
difficulty with positioning of the patient's left arm. Her results
were determined to be normal , and suggestive of no evidence of
hemodynamically secondary CAD , although the study was technically
limited.
In terms of her diuresis , Ms. Duensing was kept on IV Lasix for only
the first few days of her admission , and then was switched to PO
diuretics. Initially at a dose of 200 mg PO b.i.d. , and then
decreased to 120 mg PO b.i.d. Her lower extremity edema decreased
significantly , along with her pleural effusions.
3. Renal. Ms. Handy 's baseline creatinine is 1.7 , her creatinine
throughout her admission varied between 1.6-1.9. We caused a mild
contraction alkalosis with diuretics , but were able to replete her
electrolytes as needed. She will follow with Dr. Svinth for her
renal insufficiency as an outpatient.
4. Endocrine. Ms. Reppell has type II diabetes and was on glyburide
5 mg q. d. as an outpatient. She continued that therapy as an
inpatient , and her finger sticks were in good control during this
admission.
5. Rheumatology. Ms. Chad has a history of gout , and we were
concerned about precipitating a gout attack with the aggressive
diuresis. We continued her colchicine and decreased her
allopurinol to 200 mg PO q. d. We also continued her Vitamin E
therapy for the yellow nail syndrome.
6. Hematology. She has chronic anemia , and we continued her iron
and Procrit treatment during the admission.
DISPOSITION: Ms. Souza will be discharged to home with VNA
services to administer her twice weekly Procrit doses , and physical
therapy to aid her in regain her strength and range of motion in
her joints infected with gout. She has been instructed to make
follow-up appointments with Dr. Amicone in a few weeks , and to have
a chest x-ray on the day that she sees Dr. Burchell She should also
follow-up with Dr. Donkin in the renal clinic.

ATTENDING: LAVERN CUSTA MD , PHD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease status post
inferior myocardial infarction.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Inferior myocardial infarction.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: Rheumatoid arthritis , myocardial infarction ,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , coronary artery disease
status post carotid endarterectomy , status post cerebrovascular
accident , gastroesophageal reflux disease , diabetes mellitus ,
cerebral artery aneurysm , and depression.
The patient is a 77-year-old female with coronary artery disease
who presented to an outside hospital with chest pain that she
thought was GERD but became concerned when it started radiating
down her left arm. At the outside hospital , she was noted to be
febrile with temperature 39.8 and noted on EKG to have ST
elevations in the inferior leads. The patient was med-flighted
to Hasey Health Care for an emergent cath. The patient had 70%
LAD lesion , 50% proximal RCA , and 90% mid RCA lesion that was
stented to 0% , and a 60% PDA lesion , and LVEDP of 33 on initial
cath. Started on Integrilin post cath and transferred to CCU.
The patient did well in the CCU and was transferred out on the
next day. Previous to admission , the patient resided in a
assisted living facility and was fairly active but has had
increasing dyspnea on exertion , decreasing exercise tolerance
over the past six months.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature was 98.8 , heart
rate was in the 70s , BP was 120s/60s , respirations was 22 ,
saturation was 90% on 2 liters nasal cannula. Generally , she is
an obese female in mild distress. Some cough. Her HEENT exam
showed a clear oropharynx. No erythema or injection. Skin had
no rashes or other lesions. Neck was supple with full range of
motion. JVP was approximately 2 with 2+ carotid pulses without
bruits. No thyromegaly or nodules. Chest was noted to have
diffuse wheezing with bilateral bibasilar crackles. Questionable
right-sided consolidation , PMI nondisplaced with a regular rate
and rhythm with S4 , S1 with physiologically split S2. No
significant murmurs or rubs. Abdomen was nondistended and
nontender. Positive bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. Her
extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 2+ femoral ,
DP , and PT pulses. Neurologically , she was alert and oriented
with normal mental status and nonfocal exam. Her chest x-ray
showed evidence of pulmonary edema with focal consolidation of
right upper lobe with chest consistent with pneumonia. Her EKG
on admission , was normal sinus rhythm in the 60s with normal axis
and inferior Q waves with T-wave inversions inferiorly and
laterally.
IMPRESSION: This is a 77-year-old female status post IMI with
concurrent COPD exacerbation secondary to probable right upper
lobe pneumonia.
HOSPIATL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient did very well status post
revascularization. She did have some persistent pain while in
the intensive care unit and this went away on transfer to the
floor. She was medically optimized and continued on aspirin and
Plavix , added a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor to the patient's
1B pump. The patient had compensated heart function on
discharge , euvolemic , but she did require intermittent Lasix.
She was discharged on Lasix to treat heart failure. Rhythm-wise ,
the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the course
of hospitalization.
2. Pulmonary: The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation
with a rapid prednisone taper , and her home nebulizers , and a
10-day course of levofloxacin. Incidentally , the patient also
admitted to having a TB exposure. We placed a TB and that was
nonreactive and had induced sputums that were negative x 3.
3. Renal: The patient had well preserved renal function
normalized at discharge.
4. FEN: The patient was tolerating oral diet well and was
indicated on her instructions that she should have low-calorie ,
low-fat , low-cholesterol diet particularly given her diabetes and
she should watch her sugar and was maintained on her own.
5. Psychiatry: The patient has a history of depression and
noted to be depressed throughout the course of hospitalization
with some suicidal ideations toward the end of her
hospitalization. For that reason , we requested that psychiatry
come and evaluate her. They did so deeming her safe to return to
her facility and adjusting her antidepressants. The patient was
discharged in stable condition.
Procedures included percutaneous coronary intervention with
stenting to her right coronary artery x 2. Please see full
report for details.
Her discharge medications include aspirin 325 mg , atenolol 25 mg
p.o. q.d. , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Atrovent inhaler two to four puffs q.i.d. p.r.n. , lisinopril 2.5
mg p.o. q.d. , Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. insomnia or
anxiety , prednisone she was completing a taper with 40 mg x 2
days , 20 mg x 2 days , 10 mg x 2 days , and then off , trazodone 50
mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. sleep , Zocor 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Flovent 110
mcg b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Serevent one puff inhaled
b.i.d. , Nexium 20 mg p.o. q.d. , and Elmiron 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
The patient had followup set up with her primary care doctor ,
cardiology as well as her psychiatrist.

SERVICE: General Medical Service , Ma Ahendbrown
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSIS: HEMORRHAGIC CYSTITIS.
IDENTIFICATION: Mr. Ranweiler is a 69 year old gentleman with a
history of adult onset diabetes mellitus ,
peripheral vascular disease , chronic hemorrhagic cystitis who is
currently transfusion dependent , who was admitted with congestive
heart failure and elevated CK , MB in the setting of profound anemia
and presents for a blood transfusion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has a long , complex
urologic history which includes
prostate cancer which was treated with radiation approximately
twenty years ago. More recently , superficial bladder cancer which
was treated with partial resection. He developed hematuria
approximately April 1995. A workup revealed hemorrhagic cystitis
which was felt to be secondary to prior radiation treatments. He
has required approximately 1 unit of red cells per week for the
past three months to keep up with ongoing urologic blood loss.
The patient has no known cardiac history. His risk factors include
diabetes , hypertension , tobacco use , and male sex. No history of
hypercholesterolemia or family history. He describes 4-5 episodes
of chest tightness occurring over the past five years , the last
episode occurring approximately three months ago. He does note
progressive pedal edema over the past six weeks and over the past
two to three days has had increasing fatigue and dyspnea on
exertion. On the day prior to admission , routine VNA blood draw
revealed a hematocrit of 17. His primary care physician was
notified and the patient was instructed to report to Fiville Gadelp Medical Center on the day of admission for transfusion. Repeat
hematocrit on the day of admission was 18. He received two units
of packed red cells and chemotherapy infusion and shortly after
transfusion developed shortness of breath without chest pain.
Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure. His
initial CK was 770 with 70 MB fraction. The patient was
transferred to the Emergency Room for further evaluation where he
was treated with topical Nitro paste , 40 mg of IV Lasix , resulting
in 1500 cc of urine output. Aspirin and heparin were held
secondary to hemorrhagic cystitis. Beta blocker was also held
secondary to question of bronchospasm.
The patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for
further treatment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. AODM. 2. Peripheral vascular disease.
3. Neuropathy. 4. Prostate cancer. 5.
Bladder cancer in 1995 and 1990. 6. Status post appendectomy. 7.
History of TIAs three to four years ago. Workup revealed 50%
bilateral carotid stenosis. 8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. 9. Hypertension.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes edema. Steroids cause cytosis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Cardizem CD
180 mg p.o. q.day , folate 1 mg p.o. q.day ,
iron sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.day , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of leukemia. Father had a CVA and
kidney problems. No known coronary artery
disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Two pack per day smoking , 1-2 drinks per day. The
patient is a retired teacher at a Tyfranxingcolnlu Sxingscond A He currently lives alone and is single.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a pleasant older gentleman in no
apparent distress. Temperature 98.6 , blood
pressure 110/62 , heart rate 98. Oxygen saturation of 97% on 2
liters. HEENT: Examination is benign , no JVD , JVP was at 7 cm ,
neck was supple. CHEST: Bibasilar crackles. CARDIAC: 2+
carotids , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. ABDOMEN: Two frontal scars , liver was palpable 2 cm
below the right costal margin. The abdomen was soft , non-tender ,
nondistended , normal bowel sounds , no masses. BACK: No CVA or
spinal tenderness. RECTAL: Guaiac negative in the Emergency Room.
EXTREMITIES: 1+ left greater than right pedal edema. Superficial
ulcers on bilateral soles. NEURO: Alert and oriented times three.
Nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 132 , potassium 4.7 , chloride
96 , bicarb 25 , BUN 7 , creatinine
0.9 , glucose 186 , CK of 776 , MB 70.5. LFTs were within normal
limits. Hematocrit was 28.3 , white count 10.4 , platelet count 283 ,
PT 13.5 , PTT 26.2 , normal differential.
Urinalysis grossly bloody , 10-20 white cells.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure with small bilateral
effusions , right greater than left , plus Kerley B-lines.
EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 90 , intervals 212/72/368 , and axis 7
degrees. No ischemic changes.
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: This is a 69 year old gentleman with multiple
cardiac risk factors , chronic anemia secondary
to severe hemorrhagic cystitis , no transfusion dependent , who was
admitted with congestive heart failure after blood transfusion and
positive CK , MB. No definitive EKG changes and no clear history of
angina but recent history of increased pedal edema. The patient
likely had recent myocardial infarction and congestive heart
failure in the setting of transfusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit
for further care. As mentioned above , heparin
and aspirin were held secondary to the risk of worsening
hemorrhagic cystitis. The patient received further blood
transfusions to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30. He remained
in the Cardiac Care Unit overnight. Serial CKs revealed an A set
of 776 ( MB 70.5 ) , B set 747 ( MB 54.7 ) , C set 564 ( MB 33.2 ). CTNI
was 25.1. EKG's were without evolution. The patient was therefore
ruled in for a non Q-wave myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram
was performed on 4/17/96 which showed normal LV function , mild LVH ,
no regional wall motion abnormalities but of a somewhat suboptimal
quality. The patient received a total of four units of red blood
cells with a subsequent rise in hematocrit from 17 to 30.1 by the
first hospital day and received initially 40 mg of IV Lasix in the
Emergency Room , followed by two doses of 20 mg with excellent urine
output.
The patient was transferred from the CCU to General Medical
Service , Scogard on his second hospital day , 9/23/96. His post MI
course was uncomplicated , notable only for two runs of
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia overnight on the first
hospital day. The patient had no recurrent angina and no recurrent
evidence of congestive heart failure.
He underwent a routine post MI submax ETT on 9/3/96. The patient
went 4 minutes and 4 seconds with a peak work load of 31 , peak
heart rate of 80 , and peak blood pressure of 160/80. He stopped
secondary to fatigue. He occasional PVC's but no chest pain and no
ST changes. The test was thought to show no evidence of ischemia
but had a low work load. It was thought appropriate to discharge
the patient to home for further medical management and further
urologic workup as an outpatient. The most important medical
intervention would be to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 with
vigilant monitoring. During this admission , the patient received a
total of six units of packed red cells. and had a hematocrit of
30.9 on discharge.
From a urologic standpoint , the patient was followed by Urology
during his hospitalization , who felt that his condition was
secondary to radiation cystitis. Given that he was now having
hematuria to the extent of requiring frequent transfusions , surgery
i.e. a urinary diversion with ileal conduit , will most likely be
necessary in the near future. He will continue to follow-up with
Urology as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Ferrous sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.day , folic
acid 1 mg p.o. q.day , Glyburide 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , sublingual nitroglycerin
p.r.n. chest pain.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in good
condition and will follow-up with Dr. Arthur Matney and also with Dr. Silos as well as Urology.

Renal: Postop increase in creatinine requiring dopamine ,
creatinine now down to 1.5. P.o. Lasix started.
Endocrine: No issues.
Hematology: Anticoagulation with aspirin.
ID: Antibiotics are off. Afebrile.
Elevated white count secondary to myelofibrosis. Transferred to
Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #6. Postop day #7 , 9/19/05 ,
last remaining chest tube removed. Patient still complains of
shortness of breath , saturating well on room air. Chest x-ray

fingers and toes. If color on extremities does not improve on
argatroban , will get vascular to see. So far color in right hand
looks better. Left fingers and toes bilaterally , no worse , no
better. Respiratory status worsens , consider CT angiogram with
contrast to rule out PE with Mucomyst given creatinine of 2.1.

Discharge Date: 7/30/1992
DIAGNOSES: STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANT ON 26 of August
AORTIC DISSECTION.
NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF TOBACCO ABUSE IN THE PAST.
HEPATITIS-C ANTIBODY POSITIVE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 51 year old
gentleman with a history of coronary
artery disease with myocardial infarction in 1977 , status post
coronary artery bypass grafting in 1977 , and myocardial infarction
in 1985 , with redo coronary artery bypass grafting at Oua Medical Center , complicated by cardiogenic shock , treated with an
intra-aortic balloon pump in 1985. Since 24 of November , the patient
reported recurrent congestive heart failure with chest pain and a
variable bundle branch block requiring pacer placement with a DDD
pacer in 1990. He had an electrophysiologic study at the time ,
which was negative for ventricular tachycardia. In 1 of January , the
patient reported to Hobrook Medical Center with severe congestive heart
failure and was transferred to Mi Hospital after
treatment for transplant evaluation. At Tiesi Hospital Medical Center on 3 of March , the patient's work-up included an exercise
tolerance test with oxygen uptake of 11.1 milliliters per kilogram
per minute , and a cardiac catheterization showing an essentially
open left internal mammary artery with saphenous vein grafts and
occluded native vessels. The right atrial pressure was 10 ,
pulmonary artery pressure 54/28/30 , pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure 36 , cardiac output 3.6 , cardiac index 2 , PVR 44 , SVR 1440.
The echocardiogram revealed severely decreased ejection of around
15% with 2+ mitral regurgitation. Other issues included a positive
tobacco history in the past with a moderately decreased FEV-1 of
2.2 , and also hepatitis-C antibody positivity. The patient went
home after evaluation for 2 weeks and did well without fever or
chills. He did have some constipation. For 2 days , he had some
increased cough when lying down similar to his previous congestive
heart failure. The patient was readmitted on the night prior to
transplantation on 9 of September , for increasing congestive heart
failure and Dobutamine treatment. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was as
stated above. ALLERGIES were no known drug allergies. SOCIAL
HISTORY revealed a 25-pack-year history of tobacco , none since
1977. He has 4 children , married. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION on
transfer included digoxin .25 milligrams by mouth each day , Pepcid
20 milligrams by mouth twice a day , captopril 25 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , Lasix 80 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
Ecotrin 1 by mouth each day , Coumadin , Dobutamine drip.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a somewhat cachectic male ,
comfortable with oxygen. Head , eyes , ears ,
nose and throat examination was benign. Neck was supple without
adenopathy. Lungs were clear at the tops with bibasilar crackles.
Cardiovascular examination was notable for S1 , S2 and S3 , no S4 ,
murmur or rub. Abdominal examination was benign. Extremities
showed no edema. Rectal examination revealed guaiac negative
stool , no mass.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , laboratory
values were essentially normal , except for
hyperglycemia , mildly increased liver function tests and creatinine
1.1. On admission , blood urea nitrogen was 18 , creatinine .9 ,
glucose 176 , sodium 137 , potassium 4.1 , prothrombin time 13.1 ,
partial thromboplastin time 29 , calcium 8.5 , albumin 3.7 , magnesium
2 , ALT 17 , alkaline phosphatase 155 , total bilirubin 1.1.
Urinalysis was negative. Hematocrit was 38.8 , platelets 199 , 000 ,
white blood cell count 8.3. The electrocardiogram revealed AV
pacing at 90. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with a pacer with
the wires in the right ventricle. An echocardiogram obtained prior
to transplantation revealed right atrial pressure 10 , pulmonary
artery 54/28/38 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 36 , cardiac
output 3.6 , cardiac index 2 , PVR 44 , SVR 1440 , ejection fraction
15% , 2+ mitral regurgitation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
15 of November , and received an orthotopic heart
transplant. This was complicated by a descending aortic dissection
from the iliac to the left subclavian vein secondary to femoral
catheterization , because the patient had had 2 previous bypasses
and would not have tolerated aortic bypass. The patient did well
postoperatively and was placed on Cyclosporine-A and prednisone.
The patient was weaned off the ventilator and Dobutamine and
diuresed without difficulty. Of note , one of the two preoperative
blood cultures grew out Clostridium perfringens. Three subsequent
blood cultures were negative , however. An Infectious Disease
Service consultation was obtained , and it was felt that intravenous
penicillin for 10 to 14 days , 30 million units every 4 hours , would
be warranted given the patient's underlying immunosuppression. The
patient underwent right ventricular biopsies according to the
protocol , and there was no evidence of rejection on any biopsies.
The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the
aortic dissection on 11 of February , and then follow-up on 10 of March These
revealed a type-B dissection from the left iliac to the subclavian.
The ascending aorta was not involved. There was flow in both the
true and false lumen on both tests. The renal , SMA and ciliac
arteries were all intact. An echocardiogram on 11 of February , revealed
good left ventricular function , a small amount of mitral
regurgitation , some increased pulmonary pressures and the
dissection of the aorta. The patient underwent abdominal
computerized tomography scan to rule out any occult source of
abscess which would be responsible for the Clostridium bacteremia ,
as recommended by the gastroenterology consultant. No such source
was found. The patient's blood pressure was initially controlled
with Nifedipine 3 times a day 30 milligrams , until the patient
reached the expected postoperative denervated tachycardia. After
this point , a beta blocker in the form of atenolol 25 milligrams by
mouth each day was added to decrease force on the wall of the
dissection. The patient was transferred to the Cardiology Service
from the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service on 11 of February , and did well.
Adjustments were made in his Cyclosporine dose. He was initially
tried on some NPH insulin for hyperglycemia , but eventually with
the prednisone taper had good blood sugars on Glyburide 2.5
milligrams by mouth each day. The goal was set for the patient's
blood pressure to be kept at all times below 140 , and this was for
the most part achieved. The patient was anemic during admission ,
but postoperatively gradually his red blood cell count increased.
He was started on iron sulfate to assist in his hematologic
recovery. B12 and folate levels were normal despite polys on
stain. The patient's chest tube wounds were cultured during the
postoperative course and grew normal skin flora. They were packed
with wicks as necessary. The left groin lymph area drained clear
fluid and persisted , but had decreased substantially prior to
discharge. The patient was evaluated by the Psychiatry Service for
some features of hypomania on 17 of May They recommended Valium 5
milligrams by mouth 3 times a day to counter the steroid-induced
hypomania. Physical Therapy Service was active in the patient's
ambulation and felt comfortable that the patient would be able to
go home and manage on his own.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. COMPLICATIONS
included aortic dissection type B from left iliac to
left subclavian. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE were Cyclosporine-A 250
milligrams by mouth twice a day , Imuran 50 milligrams by mouth each
day , prednisone 25 milligrams by mouth each day , atenolol 75
milligrams by mouth each day , Glyburide 2.5 milligrams by mouth
each day , Nifedipine 30 milligrams by mouth 4 times a day ,
Septra-Double-Strength 1 by mouth every other day , Nystatin 15 cc
by mouth 4 times a day , iron sulfate 325 milligrams by mouth 3
times a day , Valium 2.5 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable. The patient was to follow a
low-saturated fat , low-cholesterol , no-added-salt diet. He will
advance his activity as tolerated. The patient was to have a
visiting nurse daily until he feels comfortable with his own care.
The visiting nurse will assist in wound dressing changes , taking
his finger sticks twice a day , taking his blood pressure and
notifying physicians for blood pressure greater than 140. They
were to check differential blood pressures between right and left
arms. The patient will also receive physical therapy assistance to
continue his progress in ambulation. The patient was to FOLLOW-UP
with the Cardiac Transplant Clinic on 28 of November , for routine
FOLLOW-UP.

was in USOH until 6 days PTA when developed bilateral foot pain
typical of gout flare. 5 days PTA developed SOB and heart racing
which was constant. Attributed sx to prednisone and stopped
prednisone 3 days PTA. Yet SOB and sensation of rapid heart rhythm
continued. She had never had the sensation before and has no h/o
tachyarrhythmia. On DOA , she came to ED for evalulation of her bilateral
gouty foot pain and was found to be tachycardic to 150 bpm. EKG notable
for narrow complex tachycardia ( SVT/likely AVNRT. )
. IN ED: given adenosine 6 mg IV x 1 with conversion to NSR for less
than a minutes , and then reversion back to SVT. She responded to
additional adenosine 12 mg IV x 1 and reverted to SR for the remainder of
her hospital stay.

pain 2/2 gout. Found to be in SVT with rate to 150 bpm. Initially ,
high suspicion of PE , given h/o PE , evolution of pleuritic chest pain ,
and SVT. LENI's were negative. She was empirically started on heparin
IV. Yet on HD2 , she had a V/Q scan with NO perfusion defect and heparin
was discontinued. The precipitating event leading to SVT was not
determined. No PE or evidence of ischemic event. However , she had
multiple metabolic derangements , especially hyocalcemia ( Ca 6.0 , iCa
0.79 , Mg. 1.6 ) as well as evidence worsening structural heart disease and
evolving cardiomyopathy. Her SVT resolved after adenosine 12 mg IV x 1
and she remained in SR during the rest of hospital stay. ECHO showed EF
40% , diastolic dysfunction and LVH likely 2/2 longstanding HTN. This
was a change from ECHO in 2002 when she had nl EF 60% , no e/o diastolic
dysfunction and no ventricular enlargement. The cause of her new
cardiomyopathy is possibly HTN and concern raised for high-output state
due increase flow thru AV fistula. We discussed the case briefly with
the vascular surg service. There is no definitive test to determine if
flow throught the aVF is too great. This may need to be discussed between
her primary renal doctors and vascular.
.
HYPOCALCEMIA: VitD level pending , PTH dramatically elevated at 914. Noted
to have elevated QTc of QTC 504 msec in setting hypocalcemia. Calcitriol
was increased and calcium citrate was initiated. Calcium was also
repleted with calcium gluconate boluses and magnesium supplementation.
Ionized calcium was followed. She is being discharged home on Calcium
citrate bid , calcitriol 2mcg qd , and prior dose of ergocalciferol.

CODE: FULL
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted after experiencing a rapid heart rhythm that normalized
after treatment with medicine. There is no clear explanation for why you
went into this abnormal rhythm , there are a few possibilities. These
include disturbances in your electrolytes , such as very low calcium , as
low as changes in your heart from high blood pressure and fluid
retention. You did not have a clot to your lungs or in your legs. You
were started on calcium supplements ( calcium citrate ) , calcitriol dose
was increased. Metoprolol dose was increased to treat your high blood
pressure.
.
KEY MEDICINE CHANGES:
1. Increase metoprolol dose
2. Increase calcitriol dose
3. Start calcium citrate: takes this medicine BETWEEN meals , as it will
be less effective if taken with meals.
4. It is important that you take all prescribed medicines to keep your
heart healthy and to make sure your electrolytes and calcium stay in
acceptable limits. If you have problems filling your medicines , please
notifiy your primary or renal doctors.
.
Contact a physician or return to the emergency room if you develop
recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , sensation of rapid heart
rhythm that does not go away after a few minutes or comes on with
breathing problems or chest pain.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Check metabolic panel , including calcium.
2. F/u on vitamin D level ( pending at d/c )
3. Check BP on elevated dose metoprolol ER

Discharge Date: 4/26/2000
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CHEST PAIN OF UNCLEAR ETIOLOGY.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Veltin is a 72 year old woman
with a past medical history
significant for coronary artery disease , diabetes , and hypertension
who presented with worsening chest pain and shortness of breath.
She had a long history of coronary artery disease with an exercise
stress test in 1997 that was positive for ischemic ST-T wave
changes. She had a catheterization at that time which revealed
diffuse three vessel disease , none of which was significant. In
1998 , she developed a left bundle branch on her EKG but it was not
clear when exactly this happened. She stated that for the past
year , she got these stabbing pains in the center of her chest that
then progressed to a squeezing pain with palpitations. Sometimes ,
there was relation to exertion but no relation to meals or position
and this chest pain had been increasing in frequency over the past
two to three weeks so now it occurred approximately two to three
times a week and was associated with shortness of breath. Two days
prior to admission , she developed constant chest pain that went to
her left arm and made four of her left fingers numb. She was quite
short of breath though she denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ,
orthopnea , lower extremity edema , increased nocturia , and diet or
medication noncompliance.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant also for diabetes for which she
took insulin and checked her sugars at home
which ran 170 range to 200 range , hypertension , and she had
idiopathic drop attacks. She got these episodes where her legs
fell out from under her without warning but she did not lose
consciousness. She had had an MRI/MRA that showed some diffuse
small vessel disease but the MRA was normal.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25
q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , simvastatin 10
q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , and NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin caused a rash and intravenous contrast dye
caused hives.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She was a retired nurses' aide who retired in
1992 , she was a widow , and she had two living
children who were grown. She lived alone and took care of her
eight year old great-grandson but had a daughter and son-in-law who
lived next door.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , significant for an elderly
obese African-American woman lying in bed in
some mild respiratory distress. Her oropharynx was moist , her
jugular venous pressure was 12 cm , her lungs had scattered crackles
at the bases , her heart was regular with an S4 , her belly was soft
and nontender , her extremities had trace edema , and her rectal
examination showed guaiac negative brown stool.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her EKG showed a left bundle branch block
and chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary
edema and Kerley B lines. Her laboratories on admission were all
within normal limits. Her initial CK was 97 with troponin of 0.01.
ASSESSMENT: In summary , this is a 72 year old woman with multiple
cardiac risk factors who presented with chest pain of
unclear etiology. She was admitted for evaluation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - She was admitted for
catheterization which showed three vessel
disease , again nonsignificant and not changed from the
catheterization in 1997. She ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. She had an echo which showed some element of diastolic
dysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 36 plus RA
but no wall motion abnormalities. It was felt that she had some
element of diastolic dysfunction that caused her to go into a bit
of pulmonary edema , maybe subendocardial ischemia. Therefore ,
while she was maintained on her aspirin and simvastatin , her blood
pressure regimen was advanced. Her heart rate was in the fifties
to sixties and Atenolol 50 b.i.d. was added. She was on a maximum
of Lisinopril at 40 milligrams so nifedipine extended release was
added and titrated up to 120 milligrams q.d. where she maintained
systolic blood pressures in the 160 range nevertheless. This could
be further titrated as an outpatient.
2. For her congestive heart failure , she diuresed approximately
four liters through admission with Lasix at 40 intravenously and
would be discharged on a seven day course of Lasix at 20 p.o. q.d.
for further diuresis.
3. Pulmonary - She did have hypoxia on admission to 85% on room
air while lying in bed. This was felt to be out of proportion to
her mild congestive heart failure and further causes were sought.
Her D-dymer was greater than 1000 and she then went for a V/Q scan
which was low probability. Her lower extremity noninvasives were
negative. She also had a chest CT which showed no interstitial
lung disease. She had pulmonary function tests which were
consistent with restrictive picture and were not much changed from
her pulmonary function tests in 1998. A pulmonary consultation was
obtained who believed that the congestive heart failure along with
obesity underlying restrictive lung disease could be the cause of
her hypoxia and , in fact , after further diuresis , her shortness of
breath much improved and she had O2 saturations that were 93% on
room air.
4. Endocrine - She was maintained on metformin during admission
and also on half of her dose of her normal dose of NPH given her
decreased p.o. intake , however , given the fact that she stated that
her sugars at home on her regimen of 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m. were
170 to 200 , she was discharged on this regimen with instructions to
check her sugar and call her doctor if they were low.
DISPOSITION: She is discharged in stable condition on January ,
2000. She will follow up with Dr. Nakajima , her primary
care doctor , and in addition , with Dr. Klang , her cardiologist.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25

Discharge Date: 4/8/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANT.
OTHER DIAGNOSIS: ORAL HERPES.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old man with
a longstanding history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure who was originally
admitted on 30 of March with worsening fatigue and dyspnea on exertion
for augmentation of cardiac function. He was well until l96l when
he initially presented with left bundle-branch block , left
ventricular hypertrophy , and transient chest pain. He then had
high grade ventricular ectopic activity in l972 treated with
Quinaglute. Subsequently from l972 to l988 , examination was
notable for worsening left ventricular function. In l988 , he had
recurrent frequent congestive heart failure and underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed an enlarged hypokinetic ventricle with
an ejection fraction of around 32%. His coronary arteries showed
acute marginal of 70% stenosis and 40% of the mid circumflex. In
1/5 , his ejection fraction by right ventriculogram was 20%. In
2/8 , he had atypical pneumonia followed by recurrent congestive
heart failure. Subsequent course was notable for dyspnea on
exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea. He was
treated with Lasix , Zaroxolyn , Captopril , and Quinaglute. In
March , he was admitted to the Worthrest Hospital for
worsening symptoms , weight gain , and creatinine of 2.9. He was
managed with decreased Lasix , increased Captopril , and ultimately
decided to treate with Lasix and Zaroxolyn. He was then placed on
the Cardiac Transplant List and underwent transplant evaluation.
Exercise tolerance test showed 8 minutes and 43 seconds bicycle
with O2 uptake of l2. Right heart catheterization showed wedge
pressure of 25. PPD was negative and abdominal ultrasound was
negative. Echo showed global left ventricular dysfunction , apical
thrombus , mild tricuspid regurgitation , and mild mitral
regurgitation. Cholesterol was l53 , l-2 immunoglobulins within
normal limits , and toxo was plus IgG and minus IgM. He had
negative hepatitis , histo , blasto , or coccidiomycosis. CMV showed
borderline IgG and negative IgM and EBV showed positive IgG and
negative IgM. Since his discharge in August , he has noted
worsening of symptoms with decreased exercise tolerance and
increased orthopnea.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and ended up being
started on Dobutamine and had gradually declining
course during his admission culminating in having a cardiac
transplant when a heart became available. This occurred on
10/9/9l. His post-operative course was uncomplicated and his
subsequent course was complicated only by acute worsening of his
renal function associated with high Cyclosporin levels with the
Cyclosporin held and the level allowed to come down. His renal
function returned to baseline. He also developed an oral herpes
lesion. He subsequently did very well post-operatively. Multiple
right ventricular biopsies were negative for rejection. On biopsy
on 11/21 , his wedge pressure was l8 , right atrial pressure l3 ,
right ventricular 48/l4 , and PA pressure of 48/24. He tolerated
slow taper of his steroids without event and it was noted that he
had some tremor also post-operatively which was attributed to
Cyclosporin toxicity. Other than that , his post-operative course
was uncomplicated.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home on 1/13/9l. He is
to have follow-up with Dr. Blay as well as Dr. Hori
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Persantine 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Clotrimazole

ALLERGIES: Penicillin and sulfa.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies tobacco , alcohol , or IV drug
use. She has two children and lives alone since hospitalization.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 99.2 , pulse 89 ,
blood pressure 130/86 , respiratory rate 20 , and oxygen saturation
100% on room air. General , the patient is in no acute distress ,
but is unable to talk with the trach tube currently in place.
HEENT , mucous membranes are moist and there are no OP lesions.
Neck , JVP is not appreciated due to the patient's body habitus.
Cardiovascular , heart rate is regular , regular rhythm , no
murmurs , gallops , or rubs. Chest , decreased breath sounds in all
fields with a prolonged expiratory phase. Abdomen , bowel sounds
are present , abdomen is obese , nontender , and there is a G tube
in place. Extremities , no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema.
Extremities are obese. Skin , no rashes or bruises. Neurologic ,
no cranial nerve , sensory , or motor deficits noted. Gait is
deferred.
LABORATORY FINDINGS ON ADMISSION: The patient's CBC reveals a
hematocrit of 29.2 , which is consistent with her baseline of 28
to 30. Her CBC , chem-7 , and LFTs are all unremarkable.
PROCEDURES:
1. Trach tube change - the patient's tracheostomy tube was
changed to a Custom #6 Bivona on 10/21/05 by Dr. Klatt ( Surgery ).
2. Bronchoscopy - A bronchoscopy was performed on 5/28/05 and
revealed erythematous soft tissue in the posterior pharynx ,
compromising the airway above the trach tube. Granulation tissue
was noted above the site of the trach tube that also appeared to
potentially compromise the airway.
3. Modified barium swallow - modified barium swallow was
performed on 10/21/05 , which revealed a moderate aspiration risk.
The patient was recommended for a mechanical soft diet.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Trach change: On admission , the patient was admitted to the
General Medical Service for problems with her trach tube. Over
the course of this admission , her trach tube did become dislodged
on numerous occasions. During these times , either surgery or
respiratory therapy were required to reinsert the trach tube.
However , the patient remained stable throughout these events with
a pulse oximetry reading greater than 92% , even when the
tube became dislodged. The patient required a Custom fit #6
Bivona cuffless trach tube. Dr. Avellano ( General Surgery ) inserted this tube
without incident. Initially , the patient did feel some irritation once the
tube was inserted , however , this resolved with deep suctioning and nebulizer
therapy. Once inserted , the new trach tube fit well and the
patient was comfortable , with oxygen saturations greater than 92%
on trach mask oxygen.
2. Redundant oropharyngeal tissue: During this admission , the
patient underwent a bronchoscopy to evaluate for possibile
decannulation. However , this procedure revealed
excessive tissue in her upper oropharynx and
what appeared to be edematous tissue in the airway. The significance of this
finding was uncertain , although it was felt that this tissue could
compromise the airway if her trach tube was removed. Therefore ,
the patient should not be decannulated without repeat evaluation of her
upper airway. Throughout this hospital
course , the patient had her trach tube in place. She was able to
use a Passey-Muir valve for speaking and she may continue to use
one with her trach tube in place.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of
recurrent pneumonia and poor pulmonary function , the patient
underwent a modified barium swallow evaluation for possible
aspiration pneumonia. She was found to have some difficulty
during this evaluation , and Speech and Swallow recommended the
patient continue a mechanical soft diet without fluid
restrictions indefinitely. During this hospital course , the
patient had been on tube feeds through her G tube , although these
may be tapered once the patient is tolerating oral food well.
COMPLICATIONS: None.
CONSULTANTS: Dr. August Adkinson , General Surgery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: On discharge , the patient's
temperature was 97.8 , pulse 81 , blood pressure 122/84 ,
respiratory rate 22 , and oxygen saturation 100% on supplemental
oxygen of 30% by trach mask. General , no acute distress ,
pleasant , obese woman. HEENT , mucous membranes are moist.
Pupils are round. Extraocular movements are intact. Neck , JVP
could not be assessed. Chest , distant breath sounds with
occasional wheezes , but no appreciable crackles or rhonchi.
Cardiovascular , S1 and S2 intact , regular , but distant heart
sounds. Abdomen is obese , soft , and nontender , positive bowel
sounds , without appreciable masses. Extremities are obese , but
without edema.

increasing edema , fatigue , and weight gain. He was found to have
worsening renal function at Leyjery Townpark Tuli Hospital Health Center At rehab ,
attempts at diuresis had been unsuccessful with increasing
diuretic doses. As he became increasingly volume overloaded , he
began to complain of left neck pain and swelling as well as left
lower extremity edema. In addition , his mental status became
increasingly more somnolent and he began to have twitching
movements of his upper extremities. At admission to Burg Hospital , Mr. Roberg denied chest pain , shortness of
breath. He did note approximately four days of left neck pain.
He also denied abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea. He
did note some constipation. He denied any fevers or chills.

ALLERGIES:
Mr. Shanafelt has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
His temperature was 96.2 degrees Fahrenheit. His heart rate was
62 beats per minute and his blood pressure was 170/72. His
oxygen saturation was 99% on 2 liters. He was awake and alert
and in no acute distress. His jugular venous pressure was
approximately 12 cm of water. His heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and a systolic murmur at the left
upper sternal border. He did not have any signs of pulses
paradoxes. His lungs had decreased breath sounds at the right
base with rales at the left base. His abdomen was soft and
distended but nontender. There were normoactive bowel sounds.
The extremities had 1+ pitting edema bilaterally at the shins.
His neurologic exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:
His sodium was 134 and his potassium was 3.4. His chloride was
100 and his bicarb was 21. His BUN was 140 and his creatinine
was 7.0. His white blood cell count was 8.4 and his hematocrit
was 26.1. His INR was 2.5. His calcium was 9.0. His EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm at the rate of 61 beats per minute. This was
a paced rhythm. His chest x-ray showed volume overload and
cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Renal: On admission , Mr. Muraski had significant volume
overload with weight gain , edema , and chest x-ray evidence of
pulmonary edema. He also had significant azotemia with a BUN of
140. His creatinine had also increased from his baseline
creatinine of 5.0 to 7.0 at admission. His physical examination
the morning after admission showed worsening somnolence and slow
asterixis with jerky myoclonic movements. On 8/26/05 , the
tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed in his right internal
jugular vein by interventional radiology. This procedure was
tolerated without complication. Mr. Stahlnecker had his first run of
hemodialysis on 9/27/05 , which he tolerated well with subsequent
improvement in his mental status and resolution of his asterixis.
He again underwent hemodialysis on 5/30/05 , 9/15/05 and
9/14/05. In addition , he underwent a two-hour run of
ultrafiltration on 5/24/05 with removal of nearly four liters of
fluid. Mr. Lavergne will continue with intermittent hemodialysis
on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday schedule after discharge from
Belllit Community Hospital . Plans are underway for Mr. Schroeppel
to have an AV fistula placed. He has a follow-up appointment on
4/3/05 with vascular surgery at F.shands Ieldmormode Hospital .
2. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: Mr. Grassman was maintained
on a renal diet. He was started on Nephrocaps multivitamin. On
9/27/05 , he was started on Phoslo 667 mg t.i.d. for a phosphorus
level of 5.8. However , on 5/24/05 , his phosphorus level was 1.8
and therefore his Phoslo was held.
3. Cardiovascular: Mr. Wallau has a long history of
hypertension and he is treated with multiple medications. His
systolic blood pressures have ranged in the 160-180s during this
admission. He was continued on his Norvasc and labetolol. He
was also continued on hydralazine at 100 mg t.i.d. In addition ,
lisinopril was added and titrated to 10 mg p.o. daily. In
addition , he was continued on his clonidine at 0.6 mg b.i.d. Mr.
Bacus blood pressure did not return to a normal level after he
was dialyzed repeatedly. His blood pressure will need to be
continued to be monitored at rehab with potentially additional
medicines added. In addition , Mr. Mok has a history of
coronary artery disease with recent non-ST elevation MI. He was
initially due to be discharged on 9/15/05 , but shortly after
hemodialysis , he had one 15-minute episode of sharp left-sided
chest pain. He was therefore ruled out for myocardial infarction
with serial enzymes and EKGs. He showed no evidence of
myocardial infarction.
4. Hematology: Mr. Buetti is maintained on Coumadin for history
of deep venous thrombosis. When he was first admitted , his
Coumadin was held in preparation for placement of a tunneled
hemodialysis catheter. He received one oral dose of vitamin K as
well as fresh frozen plasma prior to placement of the line. He
was subsequently restarted on his Coumadin and it was titrated
while being treated with antibiotics. His previous dose was 4 mg
and he will be discharged on that dose.
5. Endocrine: Mr. Woodburn has a history of diabetes mellitus and
was maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale.
6. Infectious Disease: Mr. Goodyear became febrile to 101 degrees
Fahrenheit on 1/13/05. He was again febrile on 9/14/05. His
urine culture grew out enterobacter cloacae , which was
subsequently found to be pan resistant. Prior to his
sensitivities being obtained , he was treated with levofloxacin.
When it was determined that the enterobacter was resistant to
levofloxacin , he was switched to gentamicin 60 mg IV x1 on
1/18/05. He should receive several additional days of
gentamicin approximately five or six days. He should be dosed
after hemodialysis for a gentamicin level less than 5. Mr.
Montogomery did have one positive blood culture from 7/18/05 that
grew out gram-positive cocci in clusters at the time of this
dictation. There was only one out of four bottles that grew out
these gram-positive cocci. He did receive one dose of vancomycin
in the early morning of 1/18/05. It was felt that this blood
culture most likely represented a contaminant. All of his other
blood cultures remained negative at the time of this dictation.
DISPOSITION:
Mr. Mckean will be discharged to the Westjo Hospital His
blood pressure and INR will need to be monitored. He will
continue on hemodialysis three times per week. He has an
appointment at vascular surgery on 4/3/05 to plan for AV
fistula formation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
He was afebrile. He was alert and conversational. He had
occasional rales at his bases. His heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with a 1/6 systolic murmur at his left sternal border.
His abdomen had normoactive bowel sounds , it was soft , nontender ,
and nondistended. His extremities were warm and there was no
edema. He showed no signs of uremia with no asterixis.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Almon is a 51 year old gentleman
with history of insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus and unstable angina. The patient was doing yard
work in the afternoon when he experienced an episode of nausea and
vomiting along with chest discomfort. The patient presented to his
primary care physician who noted EKG changes with ST depressions in
V3 to V6 and was sent to the emergency room which was noted to have
an old T wave inversion in lead 3 which was now upright and ST
depressions that were normalizing. CKs at that time were 974 , MB
24.3 , Troponin level was 1.77. The patient received aspirin 5 mg
of intravenous Lopressor , Heparin drip and Adenosine MIBI which was
performed back in April of 1999 revealed inferior ischemia. The
patient underwent cardiac catheterization on June , 2001 which
revealed the following: Right dominant system , no significant left
main lesions identified , left anterior descending coronary artery
with a discreet mid 65% lesion , distal 99% lesion and first
diagonal coronary artery with a proximal discrete 70% lesion , left
circumflex coronary artery with a distal after the second obtuse
marginal discrete 60% lesion , supplying the second obtuse marginal.
First marginal coronary artery had an ostial discrete 90% lesion
and a second obtuse marginal had an ostial discrete 100% lesion.
Right coronary artery had a mid discrete 95% lesion supplying the
right posterior descending coronary artery. He was also noted to
have collateral flow from left anterior descending artery to the
right posterior descending artery. The patient underwent
echocardiogram on June , 2001 which revealed the following: 1.
There was mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced
with an estimated ejection fraction of 45%. There is severe
hypokinesis of the basal and mid segments of the inferior wall and
inferior septum. In addition , there is severe hypokinesis of the
posterior wall , apex and distal anterior wall. THis is suggestive
of multiple coronary artery disease. 2. The right ventricle
appears normal in size and systolic function. 3. The mitral valve
appears mildly thickened. The anterior mitral leaflet is mildly
elongated and there might be mild systolic prolapse of the anterior
leaflet. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen. 4. The aortic valve
is trileaflet and appears mildly thickened. There is no aortic
stenosis or regurgitation. 5. The tricuspid valve appears
structurally normal. No significant tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. 6. There is no pericardial effusion.

platelets 317 , 000. Sodium 138 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 96 ,
bicarbonate 28 , BUN 102 , and creatinine 2.8. Glucose was 88.
Otherwise , she was not coagulopathic and normal liver function
tests , and a negative set of cardiac enzymes. Her EKG on
admission showed she was ventricularly paced at 54 beats per
minute and that her EKG was unchanged from her prior EKG from
September , 2005.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Cardiovascular pump: Initially , the patient's Imdur and
labetalol were held out of concern for hypertension and poor
renal perfusion. However , on the hospital day #1 without IV
hydration and holding of her p.o. blood pressure medications.
Her creatinine returned towards baseline , value is 2.3. As such ,
the patient was restarted on her home Imdur on February ,
2005. However , her spironolactone continued to be held. In
addition , her torsemide was held. Her urine output was
monitored , revealed that she put out over 2 L on her second
hospital day. As such , the patient was started on home dose of
beta-blocker Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. daily on hospital day #2 as
well as once daily dosing of her torsemide 60 mg. The patient's
creatinine continued to improve. It was felt that the patient
was achieving good forward systolic flow and then her
hypertension was resolved with blood pressures ranging from the
130s to 150s on hospital day #2. However , over the course of
hospital admission , the patient was felt to be retaining fluid
with a weight of 99 kg , up from an admission weight of 97 kg. As
the patient had previous admissions for pulmonary edema and CHF
exacerbation , it was felt that the patient should be more
aggressively diuresed to prevent pulmonary edema. As such , the
patient restarted on her home torsemide 60 mg , however , continued
to gain weight and retained fluid. As such , the patient was
changed to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix 2 days prior to discharge
and was maintained on that dose achieving over 1 L of net
diureses on the 2 days prior to her discharge. She was
discharged on 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix and achieves good effect
and maintaining adequate blood pressure.
2. Ischemia: The patient continued her home Lipitor and aspirin
doses for known coronary artery disease. However , overnight , the
evening of August , 2005 , and the morning of February ,
2005 , she developed irritant anginal pain radiating to her jaw.
Imdur had been held at admission for concern of hypertension , but
was restarted for her anginal pain and she responded well. There
were no EKG changes for this event , and her cardiac enzymes ,
which were excessive , currently negative. She was maintained on
aspirin , Lipitor , Imdur and p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin for
the remainder of her admission. She had no further chest pain
events.
3. Rhythm and rate: The patient was ventricularly paced and
maintained on telemetry. She was continued on her amiodarone 200
mg p.o. daily over her hospital course and tolerated this with
good effect. She also continued her Coumadin at 1.5 mg p.o.
daily for known atrial fibrillation and achieved a therapeutic PT
at 2.8. The patient had no complications or events from her
rhythm or rate standpoint.
4. Renal: The patient's creatinine returned to baseline by
hospital day #3. It was felt that her acute and chronic renal
failure may have been related to poor p.o. intake prior to
admission and subsequent hypovolemia. The patient had no further
issues from a renal standpoint and did not require aggressive
hydration , taking good p.o. On November , 2005 , the patient
developed an episode of 10/10 left flank pain with associated
nausea , but no vomiting , lasting 30 minutes , which she reported
was due to known gallstone in the neck of her gallbladder ,
identified by a CT of the abdomen without contrast within the
past year and by ultrasound in 2004. However , given the
dislocation of the pain , it was felt that this also may be
related to renal colic and as such , a CT of the abdomen stone
protocol was obtained on November , 2005 , which showed no
evidence of a kidney stone , however , did demonstrate once again
gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. The patient responded
well to 30 mg p.o. codeine for pain control and had resolution of
her symptoms by August , 2005 , hospital day #3.
5. Gastrointestinal: The known biliary colic had resolved by
August , 2005. The patient was continued on p.r.n. codeine
p.o. 30 mg q.6h. and Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg q.6h. p.r.n. The
patient did not require IV morphine , requesting not to use
narcotics , and had no further events of pain on her hospital
course.
6. Endocrine: The patient was initially started on her home
dose of NPH insulin 47 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. and
regular insulin sliding scale. The a.m. fingersticks were low ,
ranging from the 60s to the 70s as were her p.m. fingersticks.
This was felt to be due to decreased p.o. in the hospital
setting. As such , the diabetes service after consultation
recommended decreasing her NPH insulin dose to 35 units q.a.m.
and her p.m. insulin to 10 units q.p.m. The patient requested
minimal injections during her hospital course and at home. As
such , there was still preprandial insulin administered , as the
patient continued to express preference for twice daily
injections. The patient achieved goal fingersticks over her
hospital course and was discharged on regimen of NPH insulin. In
addition , a TSH was obtained during the hospital course which
showed a level of 19 , being elevated , as such her Synthroid was
increased to 150 mcg daily. She will follow up with her
endocrinologist to repeat her TSH and hemoglobin A1c.
7. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: The patient was restarted
on her K-Dur 40 mEq q.a.m. and 20 mEq q.p.m. for potassium loss
secondary to diureses. Her electrolytes remained stable over
course of her hospital stay. She was continued on a
low-cholesterol low-fat diet and ADA diet.
8. Infectious Disease: The patient had a UA with 8 to 10 white
blood cells , concerning for possible low-grade UTI , especially
given her initial presenting symptoms. As such , she was started
on a 3-day course of Bactrim , and completed this course. She
remained afebrile over the course of her hospitalization and her
urine culture , which showed only 50 , 000 colony-forming units of
mixed flora , her white blood cell count remained within normal
limits over her hospital admission. As such , no further therapy
was required.
9. The patient was discharged home on January , 2005 , with
VNA services.
PLAN FOLLOWING DISCHARGE:
1. To have her endocrinologist follow up her hemoglobin A1c and
to repeat her TSH level to maximize her insulin regimen as well
as her Synthroid regimen.
2. To have followup with Dr. Polashek in the Coumadin Clinic to
maximize her Coumadin therapy and ensure that she is therapeutic.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.

2.2 , BNP 18 , white blood cell count 8 , hematocrit 35.2 ,
hemoglobin 11.9 , platelets 313 , PT 13.7 , INR 1 , and PTT 31.5.
Carotid imaging: Left and right internal carotid arteries , both
with 0% occlusion. Cardiac catheterization performed at Iland Frenchcal Clami General Hospital on 10/18/06 showed stenosis in the following
coronary arteries: 70% proximal PDA , 90% proximal LAD , 70% mid
circumflex with right dominant circulation. Ventriculogram
showed an ejection fraction of 35%. EKG on 4/5/06 showed
normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 63. There was poor
R-wave progression in the precordial leads and inverted T waves
in leads III , V5 and V6. Chest x-ray on 4/5/06 was consistent
with congestive heart failure and an enlarged cardiac silhouette.
There is mild CHF , bilateral atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on the day prior to
her scheduled surgery for completion of her preoperative workup.
On 5/26/06 , she was brought to the operating room where Dr.
Gonzale performed a CABG x3 using the LIMA to bypass the LAD and
saphenous vein graft to bypass the OM1 and saphenous vein graft
to bypass the PDA. The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 107
minutes and the aortic cross-clamp time was 83 minutes. The vein
was harvested from both legs. The patient was transferred to the
Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit after her surgery where she remained
intubated for two days due to poor lung
compliance. She was also hypotensive in the postoperative period
and treated with vasoactive medications. By postoperative day
#2 , the patient was extubated and hemodynamically stable ,
however , she experienced atrial fibrillation overnight and her
Lopressor was increased. By post-operative day #3 , her atrial fibrillation
was rate controlled and she was started on Coumadin. By
postoperative day #4 , she was ready for transfer from the ICU to
the Step-Down Unit. At that point , she was neurologically intact
and her pain was well controlled. She was being treated with
beta-blockers and Coumadin for AFib. From a respiratory
perspective , the patient was being treated with aggressive
pulmonary toilet and chest PT. Her chest x-ray showed a small
right pleural effusion and she was oxygenating well with
supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient's diet was
advanced as tolerated and she exhibited adequate urine output.
The patient was treated with Lasix for postoperative fluid
retention. She also was seen by the Diabetes Management Service
throughout her postoperative stay for optimal glycemic control.
On the step-down Unit on postoperative day #5 , the patient
experienced a bradycardic incident with a heart rate of 38 and
she became hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 after her
diltiazem was increased. She was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit where she was observed for three more days.
During that time , the patient's hemodynamics stabilized although
she remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation. On
postoperative day #8 , she was ready again to transfer back to the
Step-Down Unit where she spent the remaining six days of her
hospital stay. The patient's chest x-ray suggested that she was
volume overloaded and the patient was aggressively treated with
Lasix and Zaroxolyn as her creatinine began to increase slowly
from 1.3 to 1.5 to 1.7. The diuretics were decreased. A chest
ultrasound to evaluate pleural effusion for thoracentesis
revealed that the patient had considerable atelectasis and
minimal effusion. The focus then became on chest PT , pulmonary
toilet and deep breathing and coughing. The patient continued to
ambulate with physical therapy and by postoperative day #13 , the
patient's chest x-ray showed improvement of the atelectasis in
the right lung and the patient had decreased oxygen requirements.
From a cardiac perspective in the Step-Down Unit , the patient
was in atrial fibrillation from postoperative days #9 through #11
and then converted to a sinus rhythm where she remained for the
final three days of her hospital stay. The patient had been
started on Coumadin for her postoperative atrial fibrillation and
this medication should continue at least until she follow up with
a cardiologist in an outpatient setting to reevaluated her heart
rhythm. By postoperative day #14 , the patient was in a sinus
rhythm with a stable blood pressure. She was oxygenating well on
room air and was ambulating effectively on her own. She had no
complaints and was ready for discharge to home. On that day , her
temperature was 96.4 degrees , heart rate 76 and sinus rhythm ,
blood pressure 110/60 , respiratory rate 18 , O2 saturation 94% on
room air. The patient was seven kilograms below her preoperative
weight.

ASSESSMENT AND HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM
55F with ESRD on HD ( 2/2 DM ) who had apparent syncopal episode while
at HD on 7/12 , which was similar in presentation to 4/11 episode from
recent admission.
1 ) CV: Whether or not pt actually ever a V-fib arrest seems to be in some
doubt , as she has never had an arrhythmia on tele. However , given this
is the second presentation , a proper arrhythmia evaluation was
warranted. The pt's differential included arrythmia vs obesity
hypoventilation ( pt reports OSA sx ) , hypoglycemia , and HD-related
hypotension. Ischemia ) serial cardiac enzymes negative. Pt was
continued on asa , bb , and placed on statin and NTG prn while ruling out
ischemic heart disease in anticipation of possible EP study. PET
perfusion scan for reversible ischemia was negative , showing normal
perfusion. Pump: JVP not appreciated , decreased LE edema relative to
prior admission. pt was continued home dose diuretic , and kept on a BB ,
CCB , and her ACEi to goal SBP<120. Rhythm: Pt was placed on telemetry to
monitor for arrythmia while on floor. No events were noted , but given
history , pt was taken to cath lab for EP study on 4/19/06. EPS showed
normal conduction , normal SA node , and so a loop recorder device was
implanted , which will monitor pt's HR and record if HR> or < parameters ,
or if pt triggers device to record. No signs/sx of bleeding , infectino ,
hematoma. Pt discharged on 3 day course of Keflex , to be given after HD.
RENAL: ESRD on HD. Pt HD on Wed and Sat am of admission , which she
tolerated with no difficulty. Pt was continued on EPO 10 , 000U qHD. Pt
has tunneled line in Right IJ for access.
HEME: Anemia: in setting of ESRD , baseline Hct around 30. Pt on
epogen. Anemia studies WNL.
ENDO: Diabetes type 2: Long and short-acting SC insulin. BID NPH
started at lower than home dose while oral diet is held , with lower
sliding scales , due to significant parts os stay where pt was NPO for
procedures. Wil lbe discharged on home insulin regimen.
ID: pt reports 4 day h/o productive cough prior to admission. Pt
afebrile , but on HD6 , pt has eleavtion in WBC ( 6.9-->12 ) , however
pt afebrile , asymptomatic , CXR shows no infiltrative process , and in
setting of recent procedure. Pt was placed on levofloxacin renally dosed.
DERM: Brawny skin changes: Lac Hydrin started. Candidiasis noted in folds
between pt's pannus and groin. 2% Miconazole topical poder started
PPX: PT received heparin SC , and Nexium , wil be discharged on protonix.
Code: Pt is Full Code. Health care proxy is Brain Bruess

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You have been evaluated for your unresponsive episodes. We looked at
your heart and put a recorder in your chest to monitor for any irregular
heartbeats. Please follow up with your appointments , and return to the
hospital if you notice any chest pain , lightheadedness , or if you pass out

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of 3-packs-per-day
smoking for 30 years and no alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of heart disease.
PHYSICAL EXAM: On presentation , T 97.3 , BP 143/70 , pulse 57 , 98%
on 2 liters. This is an obese female in no apparent distress ,
sitting up in bed. HEENT: Extraocular movements intact. Sclerae
anicteric. Neck: Supple , JVP at 14 cm. Chest: Crackles
bilaterally , left greater than right , half way up both lung
fields with mild decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No
murmur , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Soft , nontender , and
nondistended with positive bowel sound and no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities with 3+ edema as well as areas of erythematous and
shiny shallow ulcerations. Neurologically , euthymic without
focal deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , significant for sodium 147 ,
potassium 3.4 , chloride 110 , CO2 26 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.6 , and
glucose 69. CBC was significant for white count of 6.7 ,
hematocrit 39.4 , and platelets of 258. Her CK was 432. Her
troponin was less than assay. Her BNP was greater than assay and
D-dimer was 50 and 69.
Chest x-ray showed decreased lung volumes with moderate cardiac
enlargement. EKG showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 59 ,
axis of -36 and no acute changes.
ASSESSMENT: This is a 63-year-old woman with history of
congestive heart failure who presented with likely congestive
heart failure exacerbation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: There was concern regarding acute
and subacute silent ischemia given new ST-T wave changes in
lateral leads on the EKG. The patient was continued on her
aspirin as well as statin. She was ruled out for an MI with
negative troponins x 3. She was continued on a low-dose
short-acting beta-blocker ( Lopressor ). She was also continued on
an ACE inhibitor with this switched to captopril as a
short-acting ACE inhibitor , which was titrated up as tolerated
for a goal blood pressure of systolic of 120. An adenosine MIBI
was performed which was negative for perfusion defects. However ,
echo showed global hypokinesis with depressed ejection fraction.
Cardiology consult was called and they recommended further workup
with cardiac catheterization. However , the patient refused the
catheterization.
Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
However , she remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout her
admission. She was monitored by cardiac telemetry with several
episodes of 6 to 10 beats of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia. Her electrolytes were carefully monitored and
repleted as necessary. She remained asymptomatic with the runs
of NSVT and was continued on her beta-blocker. Given her history
of atrial fibrillation as well as depressed ejection fraction ,
she was restarted on Coumadin.
Pump: The patient presented with a frank fluid overload with
elevated JVP , lower extremity edema , and a BNP greater than
assay. She was aggressively diuresed with a goal of greater than
-2 liters a day. She responded to 80 mg of IV Lasix t.i.d. Her
creatinine was carefully followed and did increase on 11/26/03 ,
at which point diuresis was put on hold. The patient diuresed
about 3 to 4 liters each day during her hospital stay until
7/7/03. At this point , she was thought to be very close to
euvolemic.
Given the patient's echo findings with depressed ejection
fraction and global hypokinesis , a workup for dilated
cardiomyopathy was begun. The patient did not wish for further
investigation with cardiac catheterization or a cardiac MRI. Her
other labs were unremarkable including a TSH , which was normal ,
an ANA which was negative , iron studies which did not show iron
overload , and thiamine which is pending at the time of this
dictation. The patient will require close followup with careful
fluid balance monitoring as well as followup with congestive
heart failure service.
Pulmonary: She initially presented with shortness of breath.
However , this resolved with diuresis. She has a history of PE as
well as DVT and an elevated dimer was found on admission. There
was initial concern for pulmonary embolism , but the resolution of
symptoms with diuresis and a history that was not suggestive of
pulmonary emboli , did not require further followup with spiral
chest CT.
Heme: The patient's hematocrit was followed. The patient has
chronic folate and iron-deficiency anemia and she was continued
on folate and iron replacement.
Endocrine: The patient was continued on NPH 20 units for her
known diabetes. Her blood sugars were in excellent control on
this regimen. Avandia was held given it contraindication in
heart failure.
Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.6 on admission , which is up
from about 0.8 in October of 2003. Her urine eosinophils and
sediment were unremarkable , but frank proteinuria was noted which
is consistent with her known nephrotic syndrome. Her creatinine
remained stable in the 1.5 to 1.6 range until 11/26/03 , when her
creatinine bumped to 2 and kept rising until 1/28/03 , when it
reached 2.7. Repeat urine electrolytes , urine eosinophils and
sediment were sent at this point and they are pending at the time
of this dictation. The most likely explanation for increasing
creatinine was aggressive diuresis and intravascular volume
depletion. Diuresis was put on hold on 11/2/03 and 10/10/03.
Given her increased creatinine , her ACE inhibitor dose was halfed
on 10/10/03. The plan is to continue to monitor her creatinine
function , follow up on her urine chemistries and if her
creatinine resolves , to resume gentle diuresis as necessary.
Infectious Disease: The patient was found to have a UTI with E.
Coli that was sensitive to Bactrim and she was treated with
Bactrim with resolution.
Rheumatological: The patient with known chronic pain as well as
arthritis. Her Celebrex was held given her increased creatinine
and its propensity to cause fluid retention. Her joint exam
revealed swollen PIP joints of both hands as well as marked
swelling over both wrists. A rheumatoid factor was sent and that
came back negative. For her pain , she was given oxycodone p.r.n.
Once her acute renal failure resolves , she may be transitioned
to Celebrex or other antiinflammatory medications which may be
more effected for her arthritis. ANA came back negative.
Psyche: She was continued on Celexa for depression.
Code status: Full code.
FOLLOWUP: The patient needs to follow up with the congestive
heart failure service as well as her primary care physician.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: PRESYNCOPE.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56 year old black female
with coronary artery disease ,
status post three myocardial infarctions and a coronary artery
bypass graft between the years of 1973 and 1984 , who now came into
the hospital with back pain and one episode of dizziness with a
racing heart. Her cardiac history begins in 1973 when she had her
first myocardial infarction. She has had two more in 1983 and in
1984. She had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1984 in which her
LIMA was placed to her LAD , and the saphenous vein graft placed to
her obtuse marginal and the diagonal branch. The coronary artery
bypass graft in 1984 was very successful , and she has been stable
since that time without angina or congestive heart failure
symptoms. She reports that she had a negative exercise tolerance
test one year ago , Holter two to three years ago was reportedly
normal also. The only time the patient recalls having a racing
heart prior to the day of admission was when her brother died two
years ago.
On the day of admission , the patient awoke with a dull ,
nonradiating pain between her shoulder blades that remained until
the patient was given 02 in the Emergency Ward which was
approximately 12 hours after awakening. The patient was never with
this pain before the day of admission. In additional , as the
patient was walking down the street near her home on the morning of
the day of admission , she felt herself stagger , and the world
seemed to rotate around her. She sat down for about 10 minutes
until the spell passed. During this episode , her back pain did not
change in quality or intensity. She had no chest pain , shortness
of breath , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , loss of consciousness ,
trauma , headache , neck stiffness , blurry vision , paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea , or orthopnea. She does report an accompanying
racing heart that seemed regular. After this episode , the patient
drove herself to the Georgeb.sonhan Hospital Emergency Ward
for evaluation.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient had menopause at 42 years of age.
She has never had a mammogram or regular breast exams. The rest of
her review of systems was noncontributory. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft
in 1984 as reported in the history of the present illness. She has
had hypertension for ten years. An echocardiogram in 3/27 showed
left ventricular enlargement , inferior apicokinesis , lateral
hypokinesis , and 1+ mitral regurgitation. ALLERGIES: To
Penicillin which leads to anaphylaxis. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Were only Isordil and Cardizem. The patient has a 15 pack-year
history of smoking. She quit two months ago. She does not drink
alcohol or abuse IV drugs. She lives alone and is unemployed as an
unemployed LPN , and has one child.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a well developed well nourished
black female very anxious and teary eyed.
Blood pressure on admission was 180/90 in the right arm and 180/95
in the left arm , pulses were equal at 72. She was afebrile at
98.7 , and respirations of 20. She was not orthostatic. The skin
was warm and dry. There were no rashes or bleeding. HEENT exam
was benign. The neck was supple , positive jugular venous
distention at about 10 cm , but no coronary artery bruits. The
lungs were clear. The back was without costovertebral angle
tenderness or spinal tenderness. Cardiovascular exam: Regular
rate and rhythm with an S3 and a palpable S4 , with a holosystolic
murmur at the apex and a systolic ejection murmur at the left lower
sternal border. No radiation of either murmur. Her PMI was
diffuse with a sternal heave. Abdominal exam was benign.
Extremities were benign. Pulses: Femoral on the left with a
bruit , and 2+ femoral on the right without a bruit , and 1+. The
rest of the pulses were 1-2+ bilaterally. No renal artery bruits
were heard. Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented ,
and her exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission showed a normal SMA-7. Her
hematocrit was 41.5 with a low MCV at 78.7 , low
MCH at 31.3 , and a RDW of 16.1. The patient ruled out for a
myocardial infarction with normal CK's. Her chest x-ray showed a
globular heart , question of some cardiomegaly , clearly post
coronary artery bypass graft with lots of clips. She had right
atrial enlargement with loss of the retrosternal air space , but no
evidence of aortic widening of the mediastinum. No pulmonary
edema , no pulmonary vascular redistribution was detected. EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with a PR interval of .14 , QRS
.11 , and a QT of .45. She had left atrial enlargement , old lateral
T-wave inversions as well as inferior T-wave inversions. The
patient had no acute changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Involved placing the patient on a cardiac
monitor , rule her out for an myocardial
infarction , obtaining exercise stress test , echocardiogram , drawing
blood for thyroid function tests , VMA's , metanephrines in the
urine. In addition , a beta blocker was added to her hypertensive
regimen , and she was started on an aspirin a day. Her cardiac
monitor demonstrated no dysrhythmias except for a few PVC's. The
results of the 24 hour Holter on discharge were still pending. She
ruled out for a myocardial infarction. An exercise stress test
showed that the patient went 5 minutes and 45 seconds on a standard
Bruce protocol , no ischemic symptoms , stopped due to leg pains.
EKG was with 1 mm upsloping ST depressions in V4 and V5. It was
reportedly consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Because
of this , the patient should probably have an exercise MIBI on the
outside as an outpatient. An echocardiogram demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 45-50% , severe hypokinesis of the
anterolateral and posterior wall , akinesis of the inferior wall ,
2-3+ mitral regurgitation , and an intra-atrial septal aneurysm , no
tumor or thrombus was detected.
Laboratory studies on admission did demonstrate an elevated protein
of 8.5 and a globulin fraction of 4.2. Therefore , an S-PEP , IgG
and IgM's were sent and were pending on discharge.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. ,
Cardizem 60 mg q.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , and an
Aspirin a day. The patient was discharged to home in very stable
condition and will followup in REUM WILSHIP MEMORIAL HOSPITAL on 8/28/93 at 1:30. A copy of
this discharge should be sent to Dr. Mccrane , telephone number
026-6050 , who is her primary medical doctor. During her stay here ,
we were not able to get hold of him and notify him of the patient's
status.

Discharge Date: 11/8/2005
ATTENDING: MEADERS , DONNY MD
CONSULTS: Consults for this patient included Urology and
Cardiology.
PROCEDURES: Procedures for this patient included a urological
procedure with placement of a ureteral stent and subsequent
removal of the ureteral stent.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications on admission included Lasix 20 mg
b.i.d. , OxyContin 90 b.i.d. and 40 q. 2 p.m. , lisinopril 40
daily , Norvasc 5 b.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 b.i.d. , Levoxyl 88 mcg ,
Ativan 0.5 at bedtime , Niferex 150 b.i.d. , Colace b.i.d. ,
lactulose 50 daily , Faslodex 250 IM q. month , Coumadin 5 daily ,
Zometa q. month , Fosamax 70 q. week , and exemestane 25 mg po
daily.
ALLERGIES: Her allergies included penicillin , which resulted in
pruritus and a rash.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 75-year-old woman with a
history of rheumatic heart disease , status post St. Jude's mitral
valve repair as well as AV and TV repair who has CHF at baseline
with an EF of 40% to 45% as well as metastatic breast cancer and
a recent history of hydronephrosis who initially presented with
chest discomfort with exertion that resolved with rest. The
chest pain started five days prior to admission , which is
described as a 7 or 8 out of 10 associated with nausea and
shortness of breath , but the patient denied any radiation of the
pain , any vomiting , or any diaphoresis. She also said that she
had PND and orthopnea at baseline and she had recently increased
her number of pillows that she sleeps on , from two to three. Her
weight had been stable with no change in diet. She ruled out for
an MI; however , given her hydronephrosis , thought to be secondary
to her metastatic cancer and her rise in creatinine , it was
decided to place a ureteral stent , which was done by the Urology
Service. However , after the stent was placed , she developed
severe pain , fever , and increased white blood cell count.
Although the fever and white blood cell count resolved , she
continued to feel pain , and it was decided to remove the ureteral
stent since it was not decreasing her creatinine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her admission physical exam was notable
for a blood pressure of 168/94. Other vitals included a
temperature 97.2 , pulse 69 , respiratory rate 16 , and saturating
98% on room air. Her JVP was 9. She had left lower lung
crackles , otherwise clear. She has a very loud ejection murmur ,
loud S1 and S2. She was in atrial fibrillation with a
irregularly irregular heart rate with no rub and she had a 1 to
2+ edema bilaterally and she was trace guaiac positive.
PROBLEM LIST BY SYSTEM:
Heart: Ischemia: She had a negative MIBI and her A and B sets
of troponins were negative , however her C set was 0.14 , which was
thought to be an error. Her aspirin and statin were continued.
Pump: Her EF was 35% to 40%. She was kept on hydralazine ,
Lasix , and beta-blocker , and her digoxin was stopped due to
bradycardia during this admission. In terms of her valves , she
has a St. Jude valve as well as other valve abnormalities and her
INR goal was 2 to 3. She was taken off her Coumadin for her
stent procedure and then bridged with heparin for a PTT goal of
60 to85. Her Coumadin was restarted and we waited until she was
therapeutic at an INR above 2 before she was discharged. Rate:
She is normally in atrial fibrillation. She developed
bradycardia for several days , which was though to be a
combination of some Lopressor given to her in ED when she was
having her rule out as well as slightly elevated levels of
digoxin. Her dioxin was stopped. Her beta-blocker was stopped
and then restarted at a lower dose. By discharge , she was
tolerating low-dose Lopressor. During the hospital stay , on
2/29/05 she had 10 beats of VT during which she was
asymptomatic. Her blood pressure was stable.
Renal: She had acute renal failure on admission and as I had
dictated previously she had a ureteral stent placed on 2/29/05
and that was then removed on 2/24/05 because of her severe pain.
Endocrine: She was kept on her Levoxyl.
Heme: She was guaiac positive , and her stools were guaiaced and
her hematocrit was monitored. Although it dropped initially , it
did not drop further during the hospital stay. She was kept on
her home pain control medications and she required additional
pain medications when she had her stent placed.
Psych: She continued her home medications.
GI: She stayed on her lactulose and Colace and bowel regimen was
titrated to bout BM's.
DISPOSITION: She was stable on the day of discharge. She was
discharged to home , I believe , with VNA.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her medications on the day of discharge
were Coumadin 6 q.p.m. , hydralazine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 20
in the morning and 40 at night , Lopressor 12.5 t.i.d. , Aranesp
100 subcutaneous q. week , OxyContin 90 q. 12h. and 40 q. 2.p.m. ,
Nexium 40 daily , Zocor 20 mg at bedtime , aspirin 81 , Colace 100 ,
Niferex 150 , Levoxyl 88 , Senna daily , and exemestane 25 mg po
daily.
FOLLOWUP: She was instructed to follow up with her PCP.

VQ: Low probability
LABS: Creatinine of 2.2 that dropped to 1.5 with hydration ( BL
1.2-1.3 ). HCT 41.6 with drop after aggresive hydration. Lipase of 132
but has chronic pancreatitis and is now normalizing. UA and ACE
negative.
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 66 YO male with complicated PMH admitted with
hyperglycemia likely due to non-compliance and hypotension likely due
to hypovolemia. In ED the patient received 5 liters of IVF and 36U of
insulin. His blood pressure stabilized with volume and he was
transfered to the medical floor.
ENDOCRINE - DMII but with history of pancreatitis so behaves more like
type 1 - needs insulin all the time. Per patient he had been taking 20
units of Lantus QAM but patient admitted to poor compliance with both
diet and insulin. His A1C was checked and returned at 19. The patient
was started on Lantus and Lispro and maintained on an ADA diet. He was
titrated to 20 units of Lantus QHS and was requring Lispro for FS
ranging from 120-600. By 8/22 his FS remained better controlled but
were still high ranging from 200 to 400 on Lantus 16. On 3/22 the
patient expressed that he would like to leave. He is discharged o
n Lantus 20 and Lispro SS with VNA to follow finger sticks. He
was maintained on an ADA diet , however , there was some concern he
may have been eating sweets on his own. Nutrition was consulted
and provided teaching regaring diet and diabetes. The patient is
discharged to home on Lantus and lispro with VNA following
HEME - on coumadin for hx of pacer clot. Echo shows pacer clot but
not clear whether patient will be compliant enough to go home on
coumadin as he has not been in the past. After discussion with
patient agreement is that we will d/c on coumadin 5 QD ( INR on
day of d/c 1.2 ) with enough supply for one week. He will have
blood drawn by VNA with results sent to Dr. Zarkin If he his not
compliant with his lab work the coumadin will be stopped.
CV -
ISCHEMIA: Nonobstuctive CAD on cath in September with no evidence
of acute episode. Maintained on ASA , ACEi , and Statin. No BB as
current cocaine user and considered to dangerous
PUMP: EF: 20-25% Hypovolemic at admission with good response to
hydration. No episodes of volume overload. On ACEi for AL reduction.
RHYTHM: CHB with PPM in place
GI: elevated lipase with chronic pancreatitis with no symptoms and
resolution after hydration.
DISPO: The patient is discharged to home in fair condition. He has been
given teaching regarding nutrition , diabetes , and coumadin. His
medications has been discussed with him. He agrees to be compliant with
all medications , to work with VNA , and to attend all of his
appointments and blood draws. He is discharged home on coumadin and
Lantus to be followed by VNA. He is to follow up with Dr. Harnage within
the next week and will be contacted with an appointment

Discharge Date: 4/4/2005
ATTENDING: BOGGIANO , COLUMBUS WILTON MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Ventricular fibrillation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Forbess is a 75-year-old man
with ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% status post ICD
and biventricular pacer , moderate aortic stenosis who was
admitted on July , 2005 after his ICD fired at home for
ventricular fibrillation. He notes a productive cough , a
subjective fever and nausea and vomiting at home. He was
subsequently seen in Electrophysiology Clinic. He had a low
grade fever of 100.0 at that time. He was electively admitted
but on the way to the floor , his ICD fired again. He was given
lidocaine and after a third firing of his ICD , he was begun on
amiodarone. The patient then became short of breath and was in
pulmonary edema , requiring intubation. Chest x-ray showed a
right upper lobe white out. The patient was taken to Cath for
possible ischemia contributing to his ventricular fibrillation.
He had a proximal 80% LAD lesion and a mid 70% LAD lesion which
were both stented with Seifer stents. He also had a 60% D1
lesion which was angioplastied to a residual 40% lesion. He also
had a 70% left circumflex lesion. After catheterization , the
patient was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. He was
continued on his amiodarone load. He had no further arrhythmias
during his ICU stay. He was extubated the following day and was
diuresed for congestive heart failure. He also began treatment
for both community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia.
He was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on May ,
2005.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , EF of 15% , status
post ICD and biventricular pacer , moderate aortic stenosis ,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , diabetes , chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , and
hypothyroidism.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Synthroid.
2. Lasix.
3. Coumadin.
4. Lopressor.
5. Lorazepam.
6. Colace.
7. Prilosec.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon transfer out of the Intensive Care
Unit , the patient was afebrile with a pulse of 81 , blood pressure
108/74 , oxygen saturation of 84% on room air , and 97% on four
liters. JVP of 14 cm. Lungs with bibasilar rales. Cardiac exam
revealed a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen was soft with a
pulsatile liver and mild right lower quadrant tenderness with no
rebound or guarding. His extremities had trace pitting edema.
Examination of his skin revealed vesicles at the sternum above
the nipple line with a papular rash extending in a dermatomal
pattern around to the right side of the back to the midline as
well as extension down the inner portion of his upper arm.
LABS: Labs were significant for a creatinine of 2.1 , and a
negative troponin on the day of admission.
IMPRESSION: 75-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy
admitted with ventricular fibrillation of unclear etiology ,
though possibilities include underlying infection or cardiac
ischemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was taken to the Cath Lab and
had stents placed in the LAD with other residual disease
remaining. The patient was continued on a regimen of aspirin ,
Plavix and a statin. The patient often refused to take the
statin , though this was recommended. He was also started on a
low dose of ace inhibitor which the patient frequently refused as
well. We would recommend starting a beta-blocker when the
patient is more stable. The patient continued to be diuresed
with Lasix until he was uvolemic and then resumed his home dose
of Lasix 80 mg daily. An echo during admission showed an EF of
15% with moderate aortic stenosis. For his episodes of
ventricular fibrillation , the patient was begun on an amiodarone
load with a goal of a total of 10 grams at which point he should
be tapered to 40 mg per day. He has one day remaining of his
amiodarone load and should begin the 400 mg per day dose on September , 2005. He was monitored on telemetry without significant
event. The patient should follow up with Dr. Kolopajlo in
Electrophysiology Clinic.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient was treated for both
community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia with
cefotaxime , azithromycin and Flagyl. The patient completed a
5-day course of azithromycin. He is still in the process of
completing a total 10 day course of cephalosporin and Flagyl. He
has one more day of therapy remaining. The patient was also
noted to have shingles. The patient reports experiencing pain
that started on his back before the rash appeared. The rash was
present prior to admission. He was started on acyclovir on May , 2005 and this was stopped on November , 2005 given that there
was likely little utility of treatment begun greater than 48
hours into the course and because the patient preferred not to
take the medication.
3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of 1.5. Creatinine was initially elevated to
2.1 , but improved back to baseline prior to discharge.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes , but was on
no medications as an outpatient. He received a diabetic diet and
was treated with a regular insulin sliding scale during
admission. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 , indicating poor glycemic
control. He was started on a low dose of glipizide and the
regular insulin sliding scale was discontinued. The patient also
has a history of hypothyroidism. TSH was checked and was 1.6 ,
which is within normal limits. The patient was also noted to
have a low calcium level and was found to be vitamin D deficient.
We have started supplementation of vitamin D.
5. Heme: The patient is anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation
and low ejection fraction. The patient's Coumadin was initially
held but then restarted on October , 2005. He is now
therapeutic. Goal INR is 2-3. He will need to be monitored and
Coumadin adjusted as needed. The patient also has iron
deficiency anemia. He will need GI evaluation in the future. He
was begun on iron supplementation , however , the patient
frequently refuses to take this medication.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient is therapeutic on Coumadin.
7. Code status: The patient is full code.
FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Blood draw in 2-3 days to monitor INR and creatinine. Please
adjust Coumadin dose for a goal INR of 2-3.
2. Taper amiodarone to 40 mg daily on September , 2005 from the
loading dose of 400 mg t.i.d.
3. Please encourage the patient to take simvastatin , captopril
and iron supplements. The patient frequently refuses to take
these recommended medications.
4. Last day of antibiotics is March , 2005.
5. The patient will need GI evaluation for his iron deficiency
anemia.

Impression: demand related ischemia 2/2 hypoglycemia
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient had no recurrence of chest pain once she arrived on the
floor , or for that matter , SOB/N/V. She initally had difficulty
maintaining her blood sugars and was given another amp of d50 and
orange juice on the floor. After the first 12 hours , her blood sugars
have been consistently over 120. Although she was very enzyme posive
for NSTEMI ( MB 31.2-->32.4-->15.4 today ) , chest pain did not recur. IN
fact , her EKG has been normal since arriving on the floor. Therefore ,
her episode of ischemia was thought to be demand related ischemia in
the context of hypoglycemia. Causes of the hypoglycemia included hypoth
yroidism , adrenal insufficiency , and iatrogenesis. Given the finite
duration of the hypoglycemia , the latter possibility was deemed most
likely ( TSH , AM cortisol wnl ). The patient's cardiac enzymes have
peaked ( MB: 31.2-->31.4--> 15.4 ). The patient's home situation has been
previouisly known to be suboptimal--she had a son who may have been
dealing drugs in her home 2 years ago. This time , there was concern
over potential tension betwee her and her estranged husband or
medication errors. Social work was called and spoke with the daughter.
She appears to be appropriately concerned about her mother's health
and open to the idea of placement in an assisted living facility at
some later date. It is clear that an elaborate and effective system has
been worked out to monitor and treat the patient's blood sugars. The
patients visiting nurse service ( Lan Xiemore Medical Center ) was contacted to reemphasize
the importance of evaluating the patient's medication regimen. The
nurse involved in the patient's care also will initiate a request
for a home health aide to visit the patient more frequently. Elder
services was informed to initiate a consult. The social worker at
Centter Ing Community Hospital was also informed of this admission. The
patient's home situation is deemed safe for discharge. She will
follow up with Dr. Fowlie on November VNA will visit her
tommorrow. The patient's hematocrit dropped slightly the day of dischar
ge. However , the patient was guaiac negative. Parenthetically , the
patient had a slightly dirty UA on admission. She was initially treated
but given her lack of symptoms , this was discontinued.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your insulin dosage has been decreased because your blood sugar was too
low. Your visiting nurse should check your blood sugars and call your
physician if they are consistently above 150. Your dose of lipitor has
been increased because your LDL on this admission was 92.

metastatic BCA s/p 3 cycles taxol , one year herceptin , h/o DM , HTN
who p/w acute onset SOB following chemo this AM. Pt was recently
admitted for new-onset CM 1/19/05. One month prior , after
beginning taxol therapy , pt began to have increased SOB and fatigue
w/ no CP , orthopnea , LE swelling ( some cough lying down ). A chest CT
performed on 10/10 showed interval progression of CHF. At time ,
she was started on LAsix but did not fill the presciption till 4/29
An echo at Greepe Community Hospital showed an EF of 15% w/ LV thrombus , and PT
admitted to KMC . She was treated w/anticoagulation ( bridged to
coumadin ) , Had negative Adenosine-MIBI for ischemia ( though non
diagnostic ) and negative labs for CM. She was d/c following diuresis
in good condtion , stating she could walk 1/2 mile w/out SOB , PND ,
orthopnea , cough , F/C. In this state , pt had chemotherapty this AM.

*****
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 86F with hx CHF , Afib , CKD , and diabetes who
was admitted with partial SBO , bilateral aspiration pneumonia , and CHF
exacerbation.
-
GI: Admitted with partial SBO. She was treated wtih conservative
management. No NGT was required. The SBO resolved and she was passing
stool and tolerating a normal diet.
-
CV: She has a history of diastolic dysfunction. Echo 8/27 with EF 45-50% ,
no RWMA , mod LAE and RAE , bioprosthetic MV w/ tr MR , tr AR , severe TR ,
mild-mod PR. She reported SOB prior to admission which ws thought to be
due to a CHF exacerbation. She was not agressively diuresed in the
setting of the partial SBO. She is on variable doses of lasix
( 80-200mg po bid ) at home. She was initially given lasix 80mg bid which
required additional doses of lasix iv prn to diurese , so the dose was
increased to 160mg po bid. Repeat CXR on 3/17 looks a little better than
admission. Overall her SOB and hypoxia improved. She no longer required
supplemental oxygen. She has a history of hypertension and was continued
on norvasc and imdur. She also has a history of Afib , now on coumadin.
Her rate was adequately controlled. The coumadin was initially held due
to possible procedures related to the SBO. The INR remained in 2-3 range ,
likely due to the antibiotics. The Coumadin was restarted on 10/20 as the
INR was trending down , and was started at lower dose ( 2mg instead of 3mg )
given the antibiotics. Her INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted as
an outpatient.
-
Pulmonary: She has a history of aspiration PNA. The Abd CT showed
bilateral lower lobe PNA , likely aspiration. She was treated with levo
and flagyl. Her WBC was elevated on admission and decreased during
hospitalization. She was afebrile. With treatment of the pneumonia and
CHF she was no longer hypoxic or SOB. She will continue levofloxacin and
flagyl for an 8-day course.
-
Renal: She has a history of CKD with Cr baseline of 2.6-2.8. Her Cr was
2.6 on admission and 2.3 on discharge. She continued home sevelamer.
-
Diabetes: Her insulin was initially held on admission due to NPO for the
SBO. When her SBO resolved and she was eating again , her home regimen of
lantus 100 units daily , Novolog 5 units qac , and Novolog sliding scale
was restarted. Her fingersticks continued to be high , perhaps due to
pneumonia. The insulin was titrated up for better glucose control to
Lantus 12 units daily , Novolog 7 units qac , and Novolog sliding scale.
The daughter is a nurse and will monitor and adjust her insulin at home.
HbA1c 8.2.
-
ID: Treatment for aspiration pneumonia as above with levofloxacin and
flagyl. Ucx with mixed flora.
-
Heme: Hct at baseline. As above , her INR remained high off coumadin ,
likely due to the antibiotics. Coumadin restarted on 10/20 at a lower
dose. INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted as an outpatient
-
Nutrition: She had a radiologic swallowing evaluation which showed deep
laryngeal penetration with thin and nectar-thick liquid with no
aspiration and a tiny Zenker diverticulum. Diet recommendations were
ground diet ( for lack of teech ) and thin liquids.
-
Disposition: PT recommended rehab. Patient and daughter prefer patient to
go home w/ services. The daughter is a nurse. New PCP is Dr. Hermes
( geriatrics ) at 12/10 at 2pm at
Mawe Tesparks In Hospital .

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Pneumonia: She will be discharged on levofloxacin and flagyl to treat
her pneumonia to complete an 8-day course , which will end on 6/20
2. CHF: She will continue to take the lasix.
3. Hypertension: She should continue to take her previous medications.
4. Diabetes: Her insulin has been increased during hospitalization.
Continue to monitor the glucose levels and adjusting her insulin.
5. Coumadin: Her coumadin was restarted on 10/20 at 2pm ( lower dose than
prior due to the effect of antibiotics increasing the INR ). However , her
INR has been low at 1.5 and 1.4 , so the coumadin has been increased to
3mg at discharge. Continue to monitor her INR and adjust her coumadin as
needed.
6. Continue home PT as recommended.
7. Seek medical attention if she develops fever , chills , shortness of
breath , chest pain , worsening cough , or any other concerning symptoms.
8. The patient has an appointment with a new PCP , Dr. Lamar of the Dept
of Geriatrics , on 7/10/07 at Orvo Glumflu Carn Hospital .
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Pneumonia: Patient will complete an 8-day course of levo and flagyl.
Monitor for resolution of pneumonia.
2. CHF: Patient will continue lasix. Continue to monitor volume status.
3. Afib: Patient will continue coumadin , will be monitored and adjusted
by Coumadin Clinic.
4. Diabetes: Patient will continue insulin regimen at home.
5. PCP: Patient will have a new PCP , Dr. Rowling , who she will see on 10/8

presented with orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion for three days.
She recently presented with CHF/bronchospasm syndrome in 1996 that
was ultimately ascribed to mitral regurgitation and thought
secondary to rheumatic heart disease. Her symptoms resolved after
St. Jude's mitral valve replacement in 2/10 She has been in her
usual state of health until approximately one week before
admission , when she contracted a flu-like illness with fever , cough
productive of yellow sputum , headache , and diffuse myalgias ,
postnasal discharge. She was prescribed amoxicillin by her primary
care provider with minimal relief. Approximately three days before
admission she noted increasing shortness of breath when lying flat
accompanied by cough and wheezing. She has also had dyspnea on
exertion such as while doing laundry. She denies chest pain ,
except some soreness at her CABG scar whenever she coughs. She
denies light-headedness or palpitations. She does describe
increasing lower extremity edema compared to her baseline. She has
no calf tenderness. She denies significant dietary indiscretion or
medical noncompliance.

A/P:
82 yo RHM with h/o HTN , DM-2 , CAD and AVR ( on coumadin until 9/22 )
was last seen normal when went to nap this afternoon at 12:45pm. At
2:30pm woke up dysarthric , mild RUE weakness. His wife noticed slowing
and confusion. Head CT at BMC ( repeated here ) showed small left BG bleed ,
extending to left lateral ( occipital horn ). Given location , most likely
hypertensive bleed. Cannot rule out underlying small stroke. Given h/o
AVR will r/o endocarditis as well. Plan
1. admit to NICU. When transfer to the floor TAGH
2. BP control with home regimen. keep SBP<140
3. Hold ASA. Continue holding coumadin , clarify indication in
the future
4. Hold metformin for now ( in case needs CT/A ) , add insulin
sliding scale
Brief Hospital Course:
The hemorrhage was stable on follow-up imaging. INR was 1.1.
Neurologic exam was stable , with persistent dysarthria , right pronator
drift , and mild right leg weakness. Patient evaluated by PT/OT and
deemed appropriate candidate for acute rehab.
Cardiovascular: Continued to be in atrial fibrillation. Pacemaker was
firing , but on 5/25 pm had an episode of hr 30's x few seconds , and for
rest of night hr 40's - 50's. EKG unchanged from admission - atrial
fibrillation , left anterior fascicular block , some pvc's. Consulted
PH Cardiology , who analyzed the telemetry and found that bradycardic
readings were artifactual. There was no EKG obtained during bradycardia
and no documented physical exam findings to suggest bradycardia.
Cardiology felt there was no other evidence of pacer malfunction.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: RABAL , LONNIE M.D.
INTERIM DICTATION THROUGH September , 2006
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 69-year-old woman
with diabetes , hypertension , congestive heart failure ,
rheumatologic overlap syndrome with rheumatoid
arthritis/dermatomyositis , who was admitted for chest wall pain.
Of note , two weeks prior to admission , the patient reports a fall
during which she hit her chest on the floor. Upon admission , the
reasons for the patient's chest pain were unclear. Her cardiac
enzymes were negative and her EKG was unchanged. Chest x-ray was
negative for infiltrate. However , soon after the patient was
admitted to the floor she had high fevers and grew out
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from her blood.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Dermatomyositis diagnosed in 2006.
2. Insulin-dependent diabetes complicated by neuropathy.
3. Hypertension.
4. History of Graves' disease status post radiotherapy.
5. Rheumatoid arthritis/rheumatologic overlap syndrome.
6. Status post SBO.
7. B12 deficiency.
8. Idiopathic cardiomyopathy ( ejection fraction 45% ).
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , aspirin , codeine , Zocor.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone in Ent Saint She
has a home VNA two times per week. She is a former smoker , but
denies IV drug use and ethanol use.
STUDIES:
1. Transthoracic echocardiogram performed on March , 2006
revealed a left ventricle normal in size. Estimated ejection
fraction was 55% ( previous echocardiograms had showed an ejection
fraction of 45% ). There were no regional wall motion
abnormalities. There was no significant pericardial effusion.
No vegetations were seen.
2. Transesophageal echocardiogram performed on May , 2006
revealed a normal left ventricular wall thickness with no
regional wall motion abnormalities , trace mitral regurgitation
was seen. There was no evidence of valvular vegetations or
abscesses.
3. A CT scan of the chest without contrast on August , 2006 showed
a slight soft tissue prominence at the costosternal joint , but no
abscess and no bone destruction was seen. There was no drainable
fluid collection or bone destruction seen on the scan. MRI on
May , 2006 revealed a linear low signal within the sternum
suspicious for a fracture with adjacent rim-enhancing collection
extending both anterior and posterior to the sternum , suspicious
for an abscess. Hematoma is also possible.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient had a negative rule out
myocardial infarction protocol. She was maintained on her
antihypertensive medications during her hospitalization and she
was hemodynamically well controlled. Because the patient had
MRSA bacteremia upon admission and because the patient had
elevated ESR and CRP , endocarditis was entertained as a possible
diagnosis. TTE and TEE , however , showed no vegetations on the
patient's valves. The patient's CRP on May , 2006 was 135 , the
patient's ESR on November , 2006 was 90.
2. Infectious disease: The patient had fevers upon admission to
greater than 101. Initial blood cultures revealed four of four
bottles to be MRSA bacteremia. Despite treatment with
vancomycin , the patient also had positive blood cultures on August , 2006. At the time of this dictation , the patient had negative
blood cultures from September , 2006 through March , 2006. She had a
bandemia to 6 on admission. It was not obvious initially what
the source was of the patient's MRSA bacteremia. Given her
elevated ESR and CRP , endocarditis was entertained as a
diagnosis. However , both TTE and TEE showed no evidence of
vegetations on the valves. The patient had a soft tissue
prominence on examination over her sternal manubrial joint on the
right side of her sternum. The original CT scan showed a soft
tissue prominence but no fluid collection. However , MRI on May , 2006 showed evidence of an abscess or hematoma in the right
subpectoral region. The patient had a CT-guided aspiration
performed on February , 2006 and 15 mL of pus was removed. The
drain was left in place. Studies from this fluid were pending at
the time of this dictation. However , the Thoracic Surgery
Service was consulted for possible debridement of the wound.
Infectious disease service was also consulted concerning the
timing for the placement of the PICC line , as well as the
duration of the patient's vancomycin.
3. Musculoskeletal: Chest x-ray showed evidence of an old left
shoulder fracture.
4. Rheumatology: The patient was maintained on prednisone for
dermatomyositis.
5. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on her home dose of
NPH. On this dose , the patient's blood sugars were well
controlled. The patient's TSH was measured A6 at 5.129 with a T4
of 7.2 and a THBR of 1.27. The patient's dose of Synthroid was
not altered.
6. Hematology: The patient was anemic on admission with
hematocrits ranging from 24-29. B12 level on November , 2006 was
199. She was given supplementation , both orally and IM , and on
November , 2006 her B12 level was 842. She was also found to have
both iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. Iron
studies from September , 2006 revealed an iron less than assay , a TIBC
of 202 , and ferritin 182. The patient was started on oral iron
supplementation during her hospitalization.
7. Skin: The patient was noted to have excoriations and open
lesions on her legs , which were likely due to itching. The
patient was given Bactroban. All of these excoriations were
clean , dry and intact. There was no evidence of infection.
9. Neurologic: The patient was maintained on amitriptyline and
Neurontin during her hospital stay.
10. Renal: On November , 2006 , the patient had a creatinine to
1.7. It is the feeling of the team that this is due to
gentamicin toxicity. At one point during the patient's
hospitalization , gentamicin had been added for synergistic effect
with vancomycin. Gentamicin had been added as the patient was
continuing to spike fevers despite vancomycin treatment. When
the patient's creatinine began to rise , gentamicin was
discontinued. Creatinine will likely resolve with time without
gentamicin administration in the future.
A component of the arf was due to repeated gadolidium exposure from repeat
mri of sternum and a hemodynamic with worsening when acei reinitiated.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: March , 2006: In general , the patient is
fatigued and somnolent. At multiple times during the patient's
hospitalization , she became difficult to arouse. Upon touching
her sternum , however , the patient opened her eyes and was alert
and oriented. This seems to be her baseline behavior. There was
no lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular exam revealed regular rate
and rhythm , normal S1 , S2. No murmurs , rubs or gallops. The
patient had bilateral anterior chest wall pain to mild palpation
at the T3 level. Overlying the skin there was no erythema or
warmth. However , there was a fluctuant mass underneath the skin
surface. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally , but she had shallow respirations due to pain on deep
breaths. Her abdominal exam was soft and nontender. Examination
of her extremities revealed multiple excoriations that were
clean , dry , and intact. Although the patient was somnolent at
times and difficult to arouse , she was alert and oriented x3 and
her neurologic exam was nonfocal. It appears that the patient's
excessive tiredness and excessive sleeping is her baseline
behavior. When the patient needed to be awake and oriented to
perform certain tasks , such as getting an MRI , she was able to do
so. Moreover , when she was witnessed interacting with her son ,
she was more alert.
CODE STATUS: Full code.
CONSULTS:
1. Infectious disease ( Mickey Vesley , Infectious Disease fellow ).
2. Thoracic surgery.
Dr. Burt Eldridge Conedy will dictate the remainder of the patient's
hospital course , including his disposition and discharge
medications.

Discharge Date: 6/10/2005
ATTENDING: IWANEJKO , COLLIN M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: Anaphylaxis.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypothyroidism.
4. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
5. Polymyalgia rheumatica.
6. Diabetic retinopathy.
7. Urinary tract infection.
8. Adrenal insufficiency.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 86-year-old female
with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica for which she takes
steroids and has developed adrenal insufficiency. She presented
to the emergency room with shortness of breath , wheezing , and a
maculopapular rash after receiving the pneumovax shot. She
received this shot upon discharge from admission to the Baybell Lolic Hospital for syncope and dehydration. The treatment there
was IV fluids in short course and increase in her steroids. In
the emergency room , she was treated with steroids , Benadryl , and
Pepcid.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Immunology: The patient was found to have anaphylactic
reaction to the Pneumovax shot that she received. Her
symptoms resolved by hospital day #1 after receiving IV Benadryl
around the clock , Pepcid , and an increased dose in her Hydrocort
to 100 mg IV q.6h. The steroids were started on a taper and on
the night of the first admission , the patient was noted to have increased
shortness of breath and
oxygen requirements. She was treated with oxygen and increased
steroids again for presumed reexacerbation of anaphylaxis.
2. Pulmonary: The episode of wheezing that she had on the first
day of admission could also be partly explained by fluid
overload. By hospital day #2 , she had developed crackles and
jugular venous distention. She has a history of diastolic heart
dysfunction , and diuresis was initiated. Despite receiving 3
doses of IV Lasix , she had an episode of flash pulmonary edema on the
second night of hospitalization. A chest x-ray was obtained at
that time which was consistent with pulmonary edema. She was
stabilized with additional Lasix and 100% nonrebreather mask , and
nitroglycerin. Her blood pressure was 200 systolic at that time.
The plan for continued diuresis was interrupted on hospital day
#3 when she became hypotensive and febrile with a UA consistent with infection.
She was started on Levo for presumed urosepsis.
On hospital day #4 , diuresis was resumed as her blood pressure
stabilized around 110 , and she still had a 5-6L oxygen requirement. The
patient reports her dry weight is 140 to 143 lbs. Her
primary care doctor suspects it more like 149 lbs. She is
currently receiving diuresis to wean oxygen requirement and is
down to 1 L per nasal cannula. Her goal fluid status is to
negative 1 L per day , and she continues to receive Lasix IV to
meet that goal.
She was also restarted on p.o. Lasix 30 mg p.o. daily. There
was some concern about aspiration by the nursing staff. She
immediately had trouble with swallowing liquids and Speech and
Swallow was consulted. The patient failed the bedside swallow
exam and so a video swallow was obtained , which actually showed
no evidence of aspiration , and so she was continued on a regular
diet. By the time of discharge she did not require any oxygen. She would
intermittently desat to the high 80s , which would quickly resolve with deep
breathing or chest PT.
3. Endocrinology. The patient has a history of PMR and adrenal
insufficiency , on 30 mg of Hydrocort daily at home. On the
May , 2005 , in the setting of urosepsis she was placed back on stress
dose steroids which was then tapered back to her home dose throughout the
rest of her hospitalization. She has a history of
diabetes type 2 requiring insulin inhouse or oral agents. Oral
agents were held and insulin was given for glucose control , NPH
30 units in the morning and 10 units in the evening seemed to
control the a.m. and p.m. sugars pretty well. Regular insulin
was added 6 units in the morning with breakfast with the morning
NPH for 1 p.m. blood sugar control , as this was the highest blood
sugar daily. Obviously , this needs to be monitored and adjusted
as needed as well the medicine staff is going to be following her
as to whether she should resume the oral agents. She does on
occasion drop her blood sugar to 50 or 60 , which is usually
asymptomatic.
4. Renal: Her baseline creatinine was 1.0. Both her BUN and
creatinine were elevated with diuresis. Her creatinine needs to
be monitored closely and medications need to renally dosed.
5. Infectious Disease: Her urine was positive for greater than
100 , 000 group B hemolytic Streptococci and she was initially
started with Levaquin. It was switched to penicillin on January , 2005 , after the gram-positive organism was discovered and she
was switched back to Levaquin after the sensitivities came back ,
and it was sensitive to Levaquin. The Levaquin is ideal because
her coughing could also represent bronchitis. She has complained
of a cough since weeks before admission , which is now resolving.
6. Disposition: The patient does not feel that she can care for
herself at home and screening was placed to Er Medical Center , and that was accepted for the acute care center
for Saturday , March , 2005.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is just to follow up with
primary care physician. She should also follow up with Dr.
Wann from Pulmonary at the Reddis Hospital University Of An
appointment will be made for her. She should return to the
emergency room if she experiences chest pain , further shortness
of breath , severe sweating , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , or
other concerns.
LABORATORY DATA: On discharge , glucose 116 , BUN 30 , creatinine
1.3 , sodium 139 , potassium 3.4; please make a note that her
potassium requires repletion and should be monitored; chloride
93 , CO2 33 , CK 34 , calcium 8.7 , magnesium 1.8 , troponin less than

8. History of alcohol abuse.
9. History of seizure disorder.
10. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Mauras is a 72-year-old man with
history of CAD status post CABG , PCI with history of stable
angina , type 2 diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , former
smoking history and also history of seizure disorder with
cataracts and recently discharged after an admission for atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He had occasional
anginal symptoms prior to discharge. He took about two
nitroglycerins per week. Over the past week , he had escalating
chest pain requiring one nitroglycerin per day. The pain was
relieved by rest and nitroglycerin. One week prior to admission ,
his digoxin was stopped and his amiodarone was decreased. His
Plavix was stopped and his Coumadin was held. On the morning of
admission , he had chest pain. He had two nitroglycerins and
rested but the pain persisted. He was taken to the ED. In the
ED , he received Lopressor , Enalapril , Lovenox treatment dose and
a Plavix load.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes CAD , hypertension , CHF , diabetes ,
hypercholesterolemia , peripheral vascular disease and past
smoking history.
ALLERGIES: To penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for past alcohol and smoking
history. He quit alcohol 25 years ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Significant for afebrile , heart rate 45
and blood pressure 95/50. He had a left surgical pupil , left eye
ptosis at baseline. His heart had no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear. His abdomen was soft , nontender and
nondistended. He had bilateral femoral bruits , 2+ distal pulses.
No pronator drift.
LABS: Significant for hematocrit baseline at 30 to 32 , white
count of 13. His troponin peaked at 6.4.
EKG showed ST depressions in V3 through V6 that were new.
Echocardiogram on 3/23/05 showed an EF of 25 to 30% with septal
akinesis lateral and posterior hypokinesis and mild tricuspid
regurgitation.
Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospital course for this 72-year-old man with
non-ST-elevation MI.
1. Cardiovascular: A catheterization on hospital day 1 showed
four-vessel disease. No intervention was taken at that point , as
it was unclear which region was the culprit. Afterwards , he was
in hypotensive respiratory distress , likely secondary to flash
pulmonary edema. He received Lasix and morphine and he was
started on a nitro drip with improvement in symptoms. He was
found to have flash pulmonary edema and in atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response. He was taken back to the
catheterization lab and given four stents to his saphenous vein
graft , OM1 with good resolution of his symptoms and he went to
the CCU afterwards. On hospital day 3 , he was transferred to the
floor and was given an amiodarone load given his ejection
fraction and increased ectopy on telemetry. His troponin had
been trended down to the 0.2s by discharge. His beta-blocker and
ACE inhibitor were titrated to heart rate and blood pressure.
Prior to anticipated discharge , he re-developed flash pulmonary
edema secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Electrophysiology consult evaluated him and based on
his prior ejection fraction symptoms , it was decided to place a
dual-chamber pacemaker with AICD. He has had no respiratory
events since that placement. He has remained in atrial
fibrillation and was re-loaded with digoxin. He was started on
his Coumadin two days prior to discharge and was not yet
therapeutic. His repeat echo did show an EF of 55%. This was
after the pacemaker was placed.
2. Renal: He has chronic renal insufficiency. He was given
Mucomyst precath with good effect. His creatinine on discharge
was 1.1 and he was making urine.
3. GU: He has had some symptoms of urinary retention with
difficult-to-place Foley. He was started on Flomax with good
effect. His prostate was not overtly large on exam. His PSA was
within normal limits.
4. Endocrine: He is a type 2 diabetic. His home dose of
metformin was held. He was continued on Lantus with sliding
scale insulin.
5. Hematology: His hematocrit was transiently down to 24. When
transferred out of the CCU , he was given three units of packed
red blood cells given his history of CAD. Since this , his
hematocrit has been stable in the 30-to-32 range. An abdominal
CT did not show any evidence of retroperitoneal bleed. His groin
had only a very small hematoma. His stool guaiac was only trace
positive.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged home in stable condition with VNA
services. He will follow up with his PCP on 10/19/05 , with Dr.
Wicinsky on 1/14/05 , and he should have his INR checked on
3/5/05 or 1/14/05 and Coumadin adjusted accordingly.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: His physical exam on
discharge was largely unchanged , afebrile and hemodynamically
stable. He had now a pacemaker placed over the left chest.
Incision looked clean , slightly tender to palpation. He had no
murmurs or rubs , no pedal edema. His chest was clear.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest and epigastric pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76 year old woman who
is having a significant amount of GI
distress with belching and gas over several months to years who
presents with three hours of upper abdominal and chest discomfort
which she described after a fall day of volunteering and doing her
exercise. Actually she was sitting down to eat and then developed
this symptom that lasted for about three hours. The patient did
not that she has run out of her Atenolol for more than three days
prior to admission and came to the Emergency Room when her pain did
not resolve after taking some Tums and some water. The patient
denies any previous history of angina. She came into the Emergency
Room and had a blood pressure of 190/97 with a normal EKG. The
patient was given 5 mg of Lopressor and started back on her
Atenolol with decrease of her heart rate and blood pressure and
resolution of her symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesteremia.
ALLERGIES: Streptomycin.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d.
2. Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
3. Aspirin 325 mg q d.
4. Niacin 250 mg b.i.d.
5. Colace.
6. Multivitamin.
7. NPH insulin 20 units q a.m.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in a senior's home. She does
not smoke or drink alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: She was afebrile. Blood
pressure 150/90 , heart rate 84. O2
saturation was 94-97% on room air. GENERAL: The patient was a
pleasant obese woman in no acute distress , belching during her
history. NECK: Supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation except for
some initial left basilar crackles , which have cleared. HEART:
Regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs , gallops or rubs.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender. RECTAL: Heme negative , per
examination in the Emergency Room. EXTREMITIES: She did have some
bilateral trace edema. NEUROLOGIC: Non-focal.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: SMA-7 was significant for a glucose 236. CPK
was 74 , troponin 0.04. CBC and coags were
normal. Chest x-ray did show a top normal cardiac silhouette with
mild evidence of CHF. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute
ST or T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Short Stay Unit.
She was put on cardiac telemetry and was ruled
out for myocardial infarction with serial CPKs and EKGs. She had
no further episodes of her discomfort but did have continued
belching. On further discussion with the patient , she was actually
a relatively active woman who did not have any anginal symptoms in
the past and never described any shortness of breath , PND or
orthopnea. The plan was made to get an echocardiogram and do an
adenosine stress test. Her adenosine stress test was negative for
chest pain or EKG changes and her MIBI was negative for fixed
reversible defects. She therefore was felt to be negative for
ischemia. However , on her MIBI and her echocardiogram she did have
a mildly decreased LV function of 40-45% , of unknown significance
and unknown etiology. It was felt that this could be further
worked up for other causes , including sending out for TSH , SPEP ,
UPEP , and iron studies as an outpatient , as the patient was anxious
to leave the hospital. This could be done in clinic by her primary
care physician.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on her admission
medications with the addition of Axid 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and simethicone 80 q.i.d. p.r.n. for her gas. The patient
will discuss her GI symptoms with her primary care physician and
would benefit from further workup as an outpatient. The patient
was discharged in stable condition with no adverse drug reactions.
The patient will follow up with Dr. Gustavo Setaro in approximately
one to two weeks.

Transferred to Step-Down Unit on postoperative day 4.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: Mildly confused immediately postoperative , now
resolved , neurologically intact.
Cardiovascular: Cardiac meds: Aspirin , Lopressor , and Coumadin.
Hemodynamically stable on Lopressor , now back in Afib , stable
rate of 90s , respiratory ventilated greater than 24 hours
postoperatively. Extubated on postoperative day 1 without
complication. Currently on 5 liters of O2 and some pulmonary
edema , improving with Lasix 20 mg IV t.i.d. and diuresis.
GI: Failed speech and swallow. Bedside Dobhoff placed. Started
on Osmolite tube feeds at 20 mL an hour. Awaiting nutrition
input for goals. Needs video swallow to assess swallow function.
Renal: Appropriately diuresing , maintaining 1.5 liters negative
until preop weight.
Endocrine: Stable on CVI. Hematology: Anticoagulation.
Coumadin and aspirin for atrial fibrillation.
ID: No issues. Prophylactic antibiotics for chest tubes. In
step-down unit proceeded to progress well. Postop day 4 strict
n.p.o. per speech and swallow for aspiration with all
consistencies , currently on sitter. Postop day #5 , the patient
self discontinued the Dobbhoff feeding tube twice last night
requiring meds IV today until tube replaced and KUB confirmed tip
this afternoon. Dobbhoff currently okay to use. We will resume
tube feeds. Heart rate elevated to 90s-130s and also run of VT ,
which was asymptomatic. Rechecking electrolytes , BP stable.
Preop EF of 45%. Ordered echo to assess postop EF given run of
VT , which was 9 beats. Normal a.m. electrolytes. Remains on 3
liters of O2 , diuresing well. Speech and swallow will reassess
next week. Strict n.p.o. for history of aspiration. Afebrile.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Lightheadness , nausea
---
DDX: Hypertensive Urgency
---
HPI: 77 year old female with CAD s/p three stents , DM , HTN and CKD
was sent to ED by PCP after she presented to office with malaise ,
nausea and lightheadedness. Her symptoms first developed on
Thursday. She had checked her BS and BP at that time and they were
300 and 150 systolic. Her symptoms resolved but returned on Sunday
PTA and persisted throughout the day so Monday she went to
see her PCP. At the PCPs office her BP was noted to be 212 systolic
and she was sent to the ED for evaluation. Of note , on route to the
PCP office she had a fleeting episode of chest ""cramping"" which
was unlike her previous angina or MI pain. ---
In the ED: The patient received labetolol 10mg IV X2 , labetolol 400mg
po X1 , nitropaste 3"". Her BP remained above 200 despite these
medications and then she received hydralazine 10mg IV X1 which
resulted in dropping her BP to 150 systolic.

---
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for management of
hypertensive urgency.
---
CV: The cause of her high BP is not clear. There is no indication of
med non-compliance. Her PCP reports labile BPs are a problem for her.
Her BP was controlled after she arrived to the floor. She
was resumed on her home dose of Labetolol. There was discussion of
increasing her labetolol dose but this ended up not being necessary.
In fact she was symptomatic with a BP of 120 in terms of
feeling lightheaded. Therefore her hold parameters were increased to
130 systolic. In addition she had occasional ectopic apical heart
beats which resulted in early QRS complex and occasional
slight pauses <2sec. No major events on telemetry. Her heart rate was
relatively slow around 50-55 much of the time. Her EKG did show
slight ( 1mm ) ST segment depressions in antero-lateral leads and her
CKMB was elevated on admission. She ruled out for MI with three sets
of neg troponins. She may have had slight demand ischemia in setting
of hypertension. Her CKMB was normal on day of discharge. Her troponins
were always negative. She had no s/s of CHF. She was monitored on
telemetry with no major events.
---
RENAL: The patient is a diabetic and in addition reports a recent
history of contrast induced nephropathy. She had proteinuria on
admission which is slighly higher than usual ( 3+ compared to 2+ ) but
her creatinine was improved from baseline to 1.6 ( 1.8-2.2 ). A renal
ultrasound showed normal kidneys with no hydronephrosis. UPEP , SPEP
and spot urine/protein were ordered. Her spot urine protein was 222. Her
proteinuria in a chronic problem. UPEP/SPEP need to be followed up as
outpt but suspicion for malignancy is very low.
---
ENDO: The pt has history of DM and takes Lantus and Humolog at home.
She missed her lantus dose the night of admission and subsequent am
BS was high. She received NPH to cover her for the HD#1 and then
she resumed Lantus that evening. She also received her home humulog
and a sliding scale. She received a carb controlled diet. Her TSH was
1.2 on home Levoxyl.
---
FEN: Her lytes were repleted as needed.
---
GI: Her renal ultrasound showed sludge in the gallbladder and a
slightly distended CBD. Bili T and D were added and are normal. She had
no abd pain or tenderness so her gallbladder sludge is not likely to
represent a pathology.
---
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Monitor your BP at home and call your PCP if >180.
2. Monitor Fingersticks at home three times a day ( before each meal ) and
record in a note book to bring to PCP appointment
3. Return to ED if you experience chest pain , shortness of breath ,
worsening nausea , extreme sweating , fainting , falling or other concerns
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Follow up UPEP/SPEP. Follow Blood Pressures. Follow Fingersticks.

The condition responsible for causing this admission is
congestive heart failure exacerbation. Other diagnoses include
left bundle branch block , paresthesias in the fingers , benign
prostatic hypertrophy , prostatic adenocarcinoma , Gleason's score
2/4 , C5-C6 and C6-C7 disk disease , status post left nephrectomy
for renal cell carcinoma , hyperplastic polyps in 1993 and also
status post AICD and dual chamber pacer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73-year-old male
well known to the CHF Service with long-standing New York Heart
Association class 3B idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy presenting
with shortness of breath and increasing orthopnea over the last
night prior to admission from 8 to 9 p.m. The patient first went
to An Medical Center ER then left AMA without further treatment after
waiting four hours. He reports increasing cough with white
sputum since 5/8 , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea especially
over the last three days. Also there is a questionable increase
in abdominal distention. The patient had been admitted five
times in the last six months with the last admission also for
worsening dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and cough in which he
notably had a TEE-guided cardioversion and diuresis. He was
discharged on creatinine of 1.7. The patient freely admits that
he has had dietary indiscretion over the last two months ,
claiming that he has been ""eating like a horse"" with meat and
heavy sauces on pasta. The patient denies chest pain , fevers ,
sick contacts , chills , weight gain or nausea.
ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to erythromycin and
penicillin , which causes a rash. He also describes an allergy to
contrast.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was alert and oriented and in
no acute distress with blood pressure of 82/62 , heart rate of 80
beats per minute. His HEENT exam was unremarkable. Carotid
upstrokes were brisk without bruits. There were no thyromegaly
and his chest exam was clear to auscultation and percussion.
Cardiac exam did demonstrate JVP of about 18 cm and also regular
rate and rhythm with an S1 , S2 as well as an S3 and 1/6
holosystolic murmur at the apex. The abdominal exam was notable
for an enlarged abdomen , but nondistended and without pulsatile
palpable liver edge. There was no tenderness to palpation. The
extremities were warm and with 1+ distal pulses and only trace
edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission were notable for BUN of 45 ,
creatinine of 1.6 , K of 4.3 and sodium of 136. The INR was 1.3.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular. The patient was in volume overload and his
ARB and Aldactone were held. Aggressive diuresis was undertaken
for most of this stay including an IV Lasix drip , which was later
weaned to a torsemide IV b.i.d. which was later changed to p.o.
b.i.d. for a questionable reaction to the IV formation in the
form of itchiness. He was also put on Zaroxolyn throughout the
stay and he was started on dopamine drip , which was later
discontinued on 7/20/05 for long runs of NSVT that he had
possibly secondary to sensitivity to the dopamine. However ,
dobutamine was started on 2/11/05 and this dosage was increased
gradually over 8/1/05 to 1/19/05 to rate about 3 mcg/kg and
the patient tolerated this dosage fairly well. In addition ,
electrolytes were repleted throughout the stay and the patient
underwent a workup for an LVAD placement including PFTs ,
peripheral and carotid Dopplers and an abdominal ultrasound. He was shown to
have significant aortic vascular disease which was felt to represent a
contra-indication for LVAD. Discussion ongoing with the patient during his
stay revealed that he would prefer not to have the LVAD
even if he were eligible. He understood that he was not likely to live long
with the severity of his heart failure. The decision was later made to send
the patient home with a Hickman catheter placed on 11/6/05 , so that he could
receive home dobutamine. In terms of ischemia , the first set of
enzymes were flat and ischemia was judged not to be an active
issue. There were no changes on EKG. In terms of rhythm , the
patient does have history of prior AFib , however , he has remained
in normal sinus rhythm , status post cardioversion. He has had
asymptomatic runs of NSVT on the dopamine and less so on the
dobutamine as mentioned above. Currently he was paced with an
AICD. We kept the patient on amiodarone and digoxin as well as
on tele.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency and is status post left nephrectomy. We monitored
the patient's BUN and creatinine while diuresing and although ,
the patient did have an increased BUN to about 70 , diuretic
treatment was continued as a primary goal.
3. Endo. The patient has diabetes and we held oral glycemics ,
putting him on regular insulin sliding scale and NPH doses. Also
the patient had low TSH. This is probably due to subclinical
hypothyroidism or sick euthyroid.
4. Heme. The patient is on Coumadin as an outpatient and we
titrated his INR to a goal of 2-3. The patient did have some
nosebleeds on 10/21 and his Coumadin was temporarily held , but
restarted again for this goal of 2-3 later. The INR goal was
decreased less than 1.5 where the placement of Hickman catheter
with the plan to restart the Coumadin after placement.
5. Prostate. The patient does have a history of prostate
adenocarcinoma , Gleason 2/5 on biopsy in 2004. This has been
discussed with the patient by his urologist and the patient has
refused surgery now with an increased PSA , however , we did
consult a Urology while the patient was here and it was deemed
that his prostate should not be a major prognostic consideration
given the degree of his heart failure.
Physical exam at discharge , in general the patient was
comfortable and in no apparent distress , sitting up and eating
his food comfortably as far as the HEENT and neck exam his JVP
was about 10 cm. Cardiovascular exam showed occasional PVCs and
a loud P2 and S3. In general unchanged from admission.
Respiratorywise his lungs were clear to auscultation and breath
sounds were equal bilaterally. His abdomen was somewhat
decreased in size from admission , soft and non-tensed.
Extremities were warm without edema. Pulses were 1+ radial and
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally as with admission he did have
some wasted lower extremities.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home with VNA
Services. The plan is to follow his INR on Coumadin and to
continue to monitor his heart for NSVT while on dobutamine. Also
consider an ARB or Aldactone. The patient has stable kidney
function with decreasing creatinine.

Discharge Date: 3/5/1994
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. PULMONARY EMBOLUS
2. DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year old woman
with dilated cardiomyopathy secondary
to Adriamycin , status post recent admission for increased shortness
of breath and left pleural effusion. He returns now with increased
cough productive of white phlegm and progressive dyspnea on
exertion. The patient has a history of breast carcinoma in 1989 ,
treated with left lumpectomy x 2 and XRT , accompanied by
chemotherapy completed in early 1990. The patient then presented in
July of 1992 with progressive dyspnea on exertion , found to have
an ejection fraction of 17%. She was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy
felt secondary to Adriamycin toxicity. She was then treated with
Digoxin , Lasix , Captopril and Coumadin with good result. She had
subsequent development of SVT with a rapid ventricular rate of
approximately 180. The patient eventually underwent EPEP studies
with therapeutic ablation. Subsequently she had done quite well
until February of 1994 when she presented with mild cough
productive of white phlegm and increasing symptoms of right and
left-sided heart failure. She was treated with increased Lasix and
Digoxin and an empiric course of amoxicillin with little change in
her symptoms. She was then admitted on 8/7 after she was found to
have a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient underwent
ultrasound guided thoracentesis complicated by a pneumothorax
requiring chest tube placement. Evaluation of the pleural fluid
revealed a transudative effusion with all cultures and cytology
remaining negative. The patient was treated with Ancef for
approximately 7 days while the chest tube was in place and then
discharged on 6/20/94. Since that time the patient has had no
improvement in her symptoms but rather notes increasing cough which
remains productive of white sputum with occasional ""specks of red""
and progression of her dyspnea on exertion. She is now unable to
go greater than six steps of stair without significant dyspnea.
This is a significant change from approximately one month ago where
she was able to go two flights without extreme difficulty. She has
stable 3 + pillow orthopnea and pedal edema. Her weight has
increased only slightly recently. She denies any fever , chills ,
sweats , chest discomfort or pleuritic chest pain. She does not
anorexia and malaise without myalgias or arthralgias. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: 1. Dilated cardiomyopathy as above. 2. Breast carcinoma
as above. 3. Hypothyroid 4. Depression ALLERGIES: No known drug
allergies. Habits , distant tobacco use , none since 1967 , no ETOH.
MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.25 mg q day , Lasix 80 mg q day , Capoten 50
mg t.i.d. , aspirin one per day , Synthroid 2 gr. per day , Tamoxifen
10 mg b.i.d. , Elavil 75 mg q day , K-Dur 1 q day. SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient lives with her boyfriend , she is widowed without
children. She is a semi-retired Accounts Manager. FAMILY HISTORY:
There is no family history of cardiac disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 100.6 , blood pressure 116/65 ,
heart rate is 100 , respiratory rate 18. 02
saturation 90% on room air. The patient is alert , responsive ,
febrile and in no acute distress. Her conjunctiva are clear ,
extraocular movements intact , her oropharynx is clear. She has no
lymphadenopathy. Jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm at
30 degrees. Lung examination is remarkable for a few rales at the
left base , decreased breath sounds at the right base with dullness
to percussion. Cardiac examination , regular rate and rhythm with
normal SI , SII , positive SIII. Abdomen is soft and non-tender ,
slightly distended. She has pitting edema almost to the knees
bilaterally. Neurological examination is non focal.
LABORATORY DATA: SMA-7 is notable for a potassium of 5.4 and
creatinine of 1.2 with a BUN of 20. CBC
demonstrated a white count of 14 , hematocrit of 42.9 , platelets
289 , Digoxin level was 1.2. Chest x-ray showed a left pleural
effusion which is unchanged , a new right pleural effusion +-
consolidation. EKG showed sinus rhythm at 98 , left axis deviation ,
normal intervals , low voltage with poor R wave progression , no
significant change compared with 7/24/94.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with a picture of chronic
productive cough , progressive dyspnea with low
grade fevers and increased white blood cell count , in addition to
new opacity on chest x-ray. This clinical picture was felt to be
mostly from a progressive infectious process superimposed on
underlying congestive heart failure versus post-obstructive
infection versus atelectasis with an endobronchial lesion. The
patient was started on empiric course of antibiotics including
cefotaxime and clarithromycin. She was seen in consultation by the
Pulmonary Service which felt that a therapeutic trial of aggressive
diuresis was warranted prior to any more aggressive intervention
such as bronchoscopy or repeat thoracentesis. The patient was thus
treated with aggressive IV diuresis with excellent symptomatic
result. As her symptoms and chest x-ray cleared , it was felt that
a chest CT would be valuable in evaluating her left lower lobe for
possible endobronchial lesion leading to volume loss. She thus
underwent a chest CT on 2/6/94 with demonstration of a large
peripheral , red , right lower lobe opacity , highly suggestive of a
right lower lobe pulmonary infarction. No endobronchial lesions or
lymphadenopathy were noted. Given the patient's history of dilated
cardiomyopathy , off anticoagulation , an extensive discussion of the
chest CT findings with the Chest Radiologist and Pulmonary Consult
Team , it was felt that the patient should be treated empirically
for a pulmonary embolus. She was thus started on IV Heparin with
achievement of therapeutic PTT prior to switching to oral Coumadin
without complications. In addition the patient underwent lower
extremity non-invasives which were negative for deep venous
thrombosis as well as a cardiac echocardiogram which showed no
evidence of RV strain or right ventricular thrombus. Of note , this
echocardiogram again demonstrated moderately large left ventricle
with severely depressed systolic function and an estimated ejection
fraction of 15-20%. Though the possibility that the wedge shaped
opacification seen on CT was due to pneumonia rather than
infarction , it was felt that given the patient's low ejection
fraction she would need to be anticoagulated on this basis alone ,
and thus pulmonary angiogram or VQ scan would not be likely to
alter management. The patient was discharged to home.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS:

INTERIM DISCHARGE SUMMARY
SERVICE: Cardiology Tuc Pla
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. CHF exacerbation.
2. Atrial fibrillation and flutter.
LIST OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES:
1. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
2. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 77-year-old male with a
history of CAD , CHF with an ejection fraction of 30% , atrial
fibrillation ( diagnosed in 2000 , status post 4 cardioversions , on
amiodarone until January 2005 , when it was discontinued due to skin
discoloration; since then , the patient has been on Toprol ) ,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , who has done well since a
stent was placed in 2002 , not requiring any hospitalizations for
cardiac-related issues. In July 2006 , he notes that he began to
feel weak with increased dyspnea on exertion and occasional
palpitations , although he denied any chest pain. He was found to
be in atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin , with
continuation of the Toprol for rate control. He was cardioverted
in September 2006 , resulting in symptomatic improvement until January 2006
when he again reportedly felt weak , had increased dyspnea with
exertion. An echocardiogram was done in January 2006 , showing an
ejection fraction of 28%. Given his increased risk for sudden
death , a single-chamber ICD was placed.
He continued to feel even more unwell towards the later end of
January , with episodes of nausea , diaphoresis , shortness of breath ,
and abdominal pain with exertion ( these were his typical angina
symptoms in the past ). Consequently , ETT was done on 9/18/2006 ,
which was terminated after 1 minute when the patient's heart rate
went up to 130. Electrophysiology adjusted his ICD , still he
reports continued symptoms as previously described as well as
decreased appetite and weight gain of 15 pounds over 6 weeks. He
endorses worsening orthopnea and PND over the several weeks prior
to admission. He was started on amiodarone on 11/4/2006 for
atrial fibrillation. Given his worsening symptoms , he presented
to Dr. Gabard 's clinic on the day of admission for evaluation. He
was admitted for diuresis in the setting of a CHF exacerbation
and for consideration of options in the treatment of his atrial
fibrillation.

two at dinnertime.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for brother who died of an MI at age
58 , father who died of an MI at age 78 , and mother with
atherosclerosis.
ALLERGIES: Flagyl to which he gets edema and Demerol.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vitals were temperature of 95.7 ,
heart rate 80 , blood pressure 144/78 , respiratory rate 20 , O2
saturation 97% on room air. Generally , this is a
comfortable-at-rest-appearing gentleman in no respiratory
distress. Neck shows JVP is approximately 7 cm. His heart exam
is irregularly irregular with abnormal S1 and S2 , soft S3. Soft
systolic murmur at the right lower sternal border. No S4 or rub.
No heave or palpable thrill. His lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen is obese , mildly tender
without hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities are warm and well
perfused with 2+ pulses and 1+ pitting edema from ankles to
thighs bilaterally. His neuro exam is grossly intact , and he is
alert and oriented x3.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 137 , potassium 5.2 , BUN 33 ,
creatinine 1.6 , glucose 218. ALT 26 , AST 29 , total bilirubin
0.3 , alkaline phosphatase 66. BNP 659. White blood cells 599 ,
hematocrit 39.3 , platelets 196 , 000. Lipids: Total cholesterol
121 , triglycerides 166 , HDL 37 , LDL 51. EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with ventricular rate in the 70s. Normal intervals.
No ST changes. Echocardiogram , 10/27/2006 : Ejection fraction
30%. Left ventricular diameter , end-diastole , 6.2%; end-systole
4.8%. Septum is thin and akinetic at the apex. There is a
hypokinetic mid to distal wall , posterior and inferior wall.
Mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation. There is
a dilated aortic root. Chest x-ray , 10/27/2006 , shows
cardiomegaly with an interstitial process and without effusions.
PROCEDURES: On 2/25/2006 , the patient was started on
dofetilide.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient was started with a
diuretic regimen of Lasix 40 mg IV twice a day given that he
appeared to be volume overloaded by clinical exam. On
presentation , he was compensated for his congestive heart
failure , with a creatinine of 1.6. The daily goal for his was -2
to 2.5 L , and he did very well on this dose of Lasix for the in
and out goal. He was switched over to Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily on
10/20/2006. His Toprol was continued in-house , but his ACE
inhibitor was held in the setting of increases in his serum
creatinine. The plan was to restart his ACE inhibitor following
complete diuresis to dry weight. There were no symptoms or signs
consistent with ischemia in-house. The patient was continued on
aspirin and Zetia for hyperlipidemia.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: Given the patient's history of atrial
fibrillation and flutter since 2000 and his continued symptoms on
Toprol ( amiodarone was not an option that the patient wished to
pursue given the side effects of skin discoloration that he had
previously experienced ). It was decided to proceed with
dofetilide therapy on 10/20/2006. His QTc was monitored
throughout this process , and the plan was for a transesophageal
echocardiogram and DC cardioversion on 8/7/2006 for further
treatment of the atrial fibrillation. The patient's Coumadin was
continued in-house for a goal INR of between 2 to 3. To achieve
this goal , he was continued on his home regimen of Coumadin.
3. Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was taken
off oral hypoglycemics in-house but continued on his home dose of
Lantus 24 units before bedtime as well as an insulin sliding
scale.

Discharge Date: 6/1/2004
ATTENDING: FLORENCIO LUGER M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 46-year-old man with type 2 diabetes and a family
history significant for coronary artery disease including the
father who had an MI at the of 51 , was admitted to LM on 9/17
with acute chest pain. The patient was seen at an outside
hospital at 4:30 p.m. on 1/15/04. He developed acute onset of
substernal chest pain while riding on a train home from Mon Ph Pids
The pain radiated to both arms , left greater than right , jaw and
was associated with shortness of breath , nausea , and sweats. He
presented to the emergency room at the outside hospital and had
an EKG two hours later showing marked ST elevations in V2 and V3 ,
1 aVL and was reciprocal ST depressions inferiorly. The patient
was treated with aspirin , heparin , Plavix , and sublingual
nitroglycerin , Lopressor , Integrilin and was transferred to the
Ettecile Valley Hospital for an emergent PCI.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for type 2 diabetes controlled only with oral
hypoglycemics ( glyburide ) , anxiety.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Glyburide 10 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Of note , the patient recently with stress relating to his place
of work. The patient is expected a job interview on day of
admission to the hospital. The patient lives with his wife who
had an MI one year ago. The patient has no history of tobacco
with occasional alcohol one to two times a month , denies use of
street drugs.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
The patient was alert and oriented and in moderate amount of
distress secondary to anxiety following his cath. Vital Signs:
He had a temp of 100.2 , his blood pressure was 120/79 , and his
heart rate was 96 beats per minute. He was satting at 96% on 2 L
of nasal cannula. HEENT: His JVP was at 9 cm , he had 2+ carotids
without bruits. His extraocular motions were intact. His pupils
were equal , round , and reactive to light. His cardiac exam was
significant for regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , and an S4.
There were no murmurs. His lungs had decreased breath sounds on
the lower right base with crackles about one-third of the way up
on that side. His left lung was clear. His abdomen was soft ,
nontender , and nondistended. Bowel sounds were present.
Extremities: He had 2+ pedal pulses. There was no pitting edema.
Skin: Noted to be hypopigmented , the patient has a history of
albinism. Of note , one additional comment about his HEENT exam ,
the patient is legally blind. He is able to see most objects at
about 6 or 7 feet away from him.
His chest x-ray showed a right middle opacification concerning
for an infiltrative pneumonia. His EKG on admission post cath
showed a rate of 98 , sinus rhythm , and ST elevations 2 mm in V2
through V3 and ST depressions in leads II , III , and aVF. Labs on
admission were significant for creatinine of 1.4 up from a
baseline of 1.2. His cardiac enzymes showed a CK of 178 and MB
of 3.7 and troponin of less than assay. His CBC was normal.
There was no left shift. His UA was significant for a specific
gravity of 1.086 , 1+ protein , 3+ glucose , 2+ ketones , 2+ blood ,
1-3 white blood cells , 2-4 red blood cells , and trace bacteria.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. CV: Ischemia. An emergent cath on admission on 2/18/04
showed two-vessel disease and 100% LAD , osteal lesion , and a 90%
marginal 1 lesion. The LAD was stented with a 3.5 x 8 mm and a
3.0 x 13 mm and a 3.0 x 18 mm Cipher stents all to 0%. The
marginal 1 was not stented during this cath. The patient's CK
peaked at 10 , 438 , and a CK-MB at 452 and his troponin at 721.
The patient was transferred to the CCU after his cath. He was
treated with aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , captopril , Integrilin
x12 hours. The patient recovered well except for his heart rate
remained in tachycardiac at 90 to 110 range despite Lopressor
which was increased to 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. With the setting of
tachycardia , he developed ST elevation in 1 aVL with ST
depressions and 3 aVF in the evening of 3/7/04 , although his
cardiac enzymes continued to turn down. The patient underwent a
second cath on 8/12/04 , which showed that all his stents placed
in his LAD previously remained patent. The marginal 1 was
stented at this time with Cipher stent 0. The patient was doing
very well after his second procedure. His heart rate remained
slightly tachycardiac , the patient experienced no further EKG
changes.
2. Pump: The patient was on Lopressor and captopril , and his
blood pressure remained stable after his procedures. Echo on
2/10/04 showed an LVEF of 30% as well as akinesis of the mid
distal anterior wall felt in the entire apex. There was
hypokinesis of the basal anterior septum and the basal to mid
lateral wall with preserved function of the basal to mid inferior
and posterior wall. The apex is near aneurysmal. The patient
was put on heparin GTT given the risk of intraventricular
thrombus. The patient was started on Coumadin prior to
discharge.
3. Rhythm and rate: The patient remained mildly tachycardiac.
His Lopressor was titrated up to 100 mg q.i.d. for rate control
but no concerning arrhythmias were noted on telemetry. His sinus
tachycardia was thought to be secondary to a bacterial pneumonia.
4. Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes. The hemoglobin
A1c was 10.57 demonstrating the patient's conservative treatment
was insufficient. He was started on NPH and insulin sliding
scale in the hospital. Metformin was started on 1/12/04 , and he
was restarted on Glucotrol before discharge. Diabetic teaching
was instituted.
5. Renal: Mucomyst was given before and after both of his
caths. His creatinine turned into his baseline of 1.2.
6. Heme: The patient was sent home on Coumadin given his
echocardiogram significant for near aneurysmal LV and a
hypokinetic apex. The patient will need to be followed in
Coumadin Clinic. Code status for this patient remained full
throughout his hospitalization.
7. Pulmonary: The patient was noted to be febrile and to have a
right middle lobe infiltrate on admission. The patient was
treated with five days of levofloxacin but remained febrile and
tachycardiac. The patient was started on azithromycin for a
total of five-day course. The patient defervesced after 24 hours
of being on azithromycin. Also of note , on a follow-up chest
x-ray prior to discharge , was read as the patient having a
question of a cavitating lesion in his right lobe. It was
recommended that this be followed up as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
The patient was discharged on following medications.
Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tab sublingual q.5 minutes x2
doses p.r.n. for chest pain , azithromycin 500 mg p.o. q.d. x4
doses , simvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. , metformin 500 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
lisinopril 50 mg p.o. q.d. , Toprol XL 200 mg p.o. q.d. , and
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.p.m.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS:
1. The patient was instructed to call his cardiologist and
primary care doctor , Dr. Budd , within one to two days of
discharge. Dr. Osendorf is expecting the patient's call.
2. The patient is scheduled to go to the Coumadin Clinic at the
Opa Health within five days of discharge. Dr.
Callaway number of ( 733 ) 394-4873 was provided to the
patient and as well as the phone number for the Coumadin Clinic
at Tysco Oolwe Medical Center .

3. The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study
of February , 2003.
CC: Hypotension after dialysis
HPI: 56 yo male with h/o ESRD , CAD , CHF ( EF 20-25% ) admitted for
hypotension after HD. He was in his USOH until 2 days PTA when he
developed stomach upset , diarrhea , dry heaves , and a dry cough. He
denied recent travels , and had remote Abx use. At Stodun Hospital ,
he had 5.5 liters removed and afterwards his BP was 66/30. 1 liter of
NS was given and his BP rose to 73/40.
ROS: Chronic PND , uses 1 pillow , gained 8kg in 2 weeks but compliant

EKG: NSR , 1st deg AVB , LAE , LVH , old TWI in 1 , L , V5 , V6 , more pronounced
ST dep in V5 than 9/24
CXR: R pl effusion , CMG
Assessment: Hypotension after dialysis in setting of GI
upset/diarrhea/vomiting , likely was dehydrated. The BP rose after
fluids and his current hypoxia is likely from mild pulm edema.
Although chronically elevated cardiac enzymes , there is concern about
new ishemia , and concern for PE given hypoxia in ED.
Hospital course
1. CVS: Ischemia: NSTEMI: contined medical management with asa , beta
blocker , imdur , zocor , ntg prn. The CkMB peaked at 12 and Tni to 4. His
cardiologist ( Dr Benisek ) recommended PET scan to assess for viable
myocardium and ischemia. His last stress test 1 year ago showed only
scarring with no ischemia. In the past , pt's wife refused for him to go
for CABG. They are reconsidering this option currently.
The results of the PET scan are as follows:
- A small region of myocardial scar/hibernation along with mild
residual stress induced peri-infarct ischemia in the distal LAD
distribution.
- Moderate global LV systolic dysfunction.
- The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study of February ,
2003.
The family was called to stress the importance of follow up with
cardiology ( They have missed appointments in the past )
Pump: ( EF 20-25% ) , increased enalapril to 10mg bid , BNP was sent and
pending and echo revealed EF 30% , Mod AI.
Rhythm: no events occurred on telemetry
2. Pulm: monitored sats with fluid restriction. RA sats improved to
97%
3. Renal: HD MWF , home renal meds. He was dialyzed to a weight below
his previous baseline per cardiology recommendations. In the past he
has had elevated RH filling pressures after HD. The Ryi was
called by the attendting renal physician ( Dr. Slemp ) about his goal
weight.
4. ID: Blood cx were no growth
5. GI: He was continued on his home nexium
6. Proph: SQ heparin was used for DVT prophylaxis
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: It is very important that you attend your follow up appointment with
the cardiologist , Dr Ivrin
Please take the medications listed above and do not take enalapril on
mornings of dialysis
Please adhere to your dietary restrictions. If you gain more than 3 kg
between dialysis sessions please restrict your fluid intake. The diet
guidelines will be coordinated by the staff at Chapmed Gamette Medical Center

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mrs. Marnett is an 81 y.o. woman who presents with one day of
chest pain , difficulty speaking , nausea , and lightheadedness. She had
URI symptoms about two weeks ago and then 5d pta developed minimal
ly productive cough and then SOB for the past 2-3 days. She denies any
noctural dyspnea or increase in number of pillows. She lives alone ,
and a reverend checks up on her daily; the day prior to admission he
suggested she go to the hospital. She does not feel that she had any
speech difficulties at that time , but when she awoke she noted
heaviness of her tongue and workd finding difficulties. In addition , she
had sweating and chest pain that radiated to her shoulder ( L>R ) , and
back. This was different than her usual anginal symptoms ( which do not
involve back radiation ). The pain was pleuritic in nature , and she
denied palpitations. She also noticed nausea and had several episodes
of dry heaving. While leaving the bathroom she had a single episode of
""lightheadness."" This did not involve any sensation of vertigo , or any
vision changes. She sat down immediately , and felt better within a few
seconds. There was no fall and no LOC. Around 8am , her housekeeper
came , and immediately noticed a change in Mrs. Cooney 's voice. Mrs.
Solberg describes the change as a ""thickening of my tongue"" and some
problems finding words. She has been taking all of her medications as
prescribed over the last week.
ROS: On arrival to the floor , Mrs. Shoman noted a raised , painful
area on her L forearm. She does not recall any trauma to the area. She
denies any fever.

Hospital course by system:
Neuro: Speech difficulties: resolved by the time pt was in ER , making
diagnosis difficult. Possible etiologies include TIA or illness
exacerbating deficits from old stroke. Head CT in ER showed old
infarcts , but no acute process. Patient did not have any speech
difficulties throughout admission or other neurologic findings.
CV: ischemia: No ST changes on EKG , one set of cardiac enzymes were
negative. Given low probability of ischemia , no further enzymes were
drawn. Pump: EF 55% , patient was normotensive even after d/c of
some of her home HTN meds ( see renal ). Rhythm: pt was on telemetry for
first day of admission , and alternated between sinus rhythm and afib.
Pulm: PNA: pt had left lower lobe opacity on CXR. Decision was made to
start antibiotics. Pt had a positive d-dimer , but PE was very unlikely
in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation. The patient has a
history of CHF , but had no signs of CHF on exam during this
hospitalizaiton although her cxr was read as mild pulmonary edema.
Renal: ARF: Creatine on admission was 1.8 , up from a baseline of
1.2-1.3. Given her h/o poor po intake and euvolemic to dry exam ,
this was thought likely due to prerenal hypovolemia. Her
lasix , lisinopril and colchicine were held , as they might contribute to
further ARF , and she got gentle ivf ( approximately 1L ) and her
creatinine improved. However , after restarting her medications her Cr
again bumped to 1.8. Her UA was unremarkable. She was d/c home off
lasix , lisinopril and colchicine with a Cr of 1.8 presuming that sh
e was still prerenal. The plan is for VNA to check her chem7 in 3days
days , results to go to Dr. Skibo for monitoring and deciding when to
restart her medications.
MSK: Pt developed the left forearm swelling and pain while in the hosp
for the first night. A radiograph was negative for fracture and it was
felt to be a small hematoma. The pain remitted with Tylenol. At
discharge the pain was a dull ache , and the swelling was reduced.
Heme: Anticoagulation. She was maintained on her home dose of INR was
maintained in a theraputic range. This will have to be closely
monitored as an outpatient while on levofloxacin. Her INR was 3 after 2
days of levofloxacin and will be checked again by VNA 3 days
after discharge , results to be followed by Sheldon Dingmann
Endo: D.M. Pt was switched from micronase to glipizide 2.5mg qd given
her worsening renal insufficiency. Fingersticks remained in acceptable
range ( 100-148 ) during admission.
Dispo: to home with close VNA followup ( daily ). Pt will have weight
and BP checked qd. She will have Chem-7 and INR drawn on Thursday and
Monday , and the results will be called to Dr. Benamati ( TERT VALLEY HOSPITAL CENTER ). She will
finish 6 more days of Levo ( total 10 ).
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you develop a fever , become short of breath , have increasing left arm
pain , or any other symptoms that concern you , call your doctor.
The visiting nurse is an important followup to your
hospitalization.Your diabetes medication was changed to glipizide -stop
taking the micronase. Your lasix , lisinopril and colchicine have been
stopped , don't restart them until Dr. Schoville tells you to restart. Your othe
medications are the same. Weigh yourself daily and if your weight increa
ses more than 2lbs in 2 days call Dr. Szesterniak
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. VNA will check BP and weight qd. Any BP > 140/90 or wt gain of 2
lbs in 2 days will be called to Dr. Kempf ( BROTHERSCIAL GITER HEALTHCARE OF 703-958-5135 )
2. Thursday ( 20 of September ) and Mon ( 1 of April ) VNA will draw a Chem-7 and INR
and call results to Dr. Maria ( WA ASSPUNX HOSPITAL ); INR should be communicated to Blaine Lindquist at 731-463-2245.
3. Pt has followup appointment on 8 of September at 10:30am with
Dr. Speranza 4. There are 6 more days of Levofloxacin course.

Discharge Date: 8/9/1993
DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING ON
17 of October , BY DR. RAFALKO ,
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 58 year old male with
crescendo angina. The patient has a
long history of coronary artery disease and suffered an anterior
septal myocardial infarction in 1989. The patient did well on
medical management , until recently when he has developed increasing
fatigue and angina with decreased exertion. The patient had an
exercise stress thallium test on 16 of June , which showed ST depression
in V5 after 6 minutes and 38 seconds. The thallium aspect of the
test showed apical inferior reperfusion defect. A cardiac
catheterization in 18 of June , showed a 60 to 80% lesion at the left
anterior descending , 60% lesion of the first diagonal and 50%
lesion of the circumflex , 100% lesion of the right coronary artery.
Inferiorly , the heart was noted to be akinetic with areas of
dyskinesis. The ejection fraction was 45%. PA pressures were
32/20 with a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 13 mm/HG.
The patient now presents with increasing angina , failing medical
therapy. The patient denied a history of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , orthopnea , pedal edema. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY included
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus times 14 years , status post
cerebrovascular accident left parieto-occipital hemorrhagic infarct
without any cognitive residual defects. The patient has a seizure
disorder since then , controlled on phenobarbital. History also
included hypertension , bursitis. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY included
status post right knee surgery times 3 , status post patellar
fracture in 1958. ALLERGIES included Demerol , which produces
nausea and vomiting. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Cardizem-CD 240
milligrams by mouth each day , Isordil 40 milligrams by mouth 3
times a day , Lopressor 200 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
enteric-coated aspirin 1 each day discontinued 10 days prior to
admission , phenobarbital 30 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day ,
humulin 70/30 - 36 units each morning. FAMILY HISTORY was
significant for myocardial infarction. HABITS included a
90-pack-year smoking history , discontinued in 1989. Alcohol use
was discontinued in 1991.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a nervous , but pleasant
white male in no apparent distress. The
temperature was 97.7 , pulse 76 , respiratory rate 24 , blood pressure
136/84 , 98% room air saturation. Cardiac examination showed
regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , without murmurs , gallops or
rubs. Neck was supple. Chest was clear to auscultation. Abdomen
was obese , soft , positive bowel sounds. Extremities showed pulses
intact bilaterally , no varicosities , no bruits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and underwent the usual
preoperative evaluation , and was taken to the
operating room on 17 of October , for 3-vessel coronary artery bypass
grafting by Dr. Mcquerry The patient tolerated the procedure well ,
and initially recovered in the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was followed by the Cardiology Service as is routine.
The patient's lines and tubes were pulled in the usual fashion at
the appropriate times. The patient was stable and was transferred
to the Step-Down Cardiac Surgery Floor. Postoperatively , the
patient developed atrial fibrillation , which resolved
spontaneously. postoperatively , the lower sternal wound had a
small amount of serosanguineous drainage and a small amount of
erythema. The patient was given a course of intravenous Ancef.
The patient received a total of 5 days of intravenous Ancef. The
patient was discharged home on 6 of February , tolerating a regular diet
and ambulating without difficulty. The patient's wound had cleared
up and was free of erythema or drainage. The sternum was stable at
discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. MEDICATIONS
ON DISCHARGE were Tylenol #3 as needed ,
enteric-coated aspirin 1 each day , Lopressor 25 milligrams by mouth
twice a day , phenobarbital 45 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day ,

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
71F with extensive PMHs including CHF , diastolic
dysfxn ( EF 60% ) , AS , AFib , DM , CRI , OSA p/w progressive dyspnea , fatigue ,
periph edema , weight gain. Admitted 3wks ago w/similar complaints -
was diuresed heavily w/~8lb weight loss
and symptomatic relief. Post D/C , did well for a
few days , then started developing progressive DOE ,
fatigue , orthopnea , as well as weight gain
of ~8-10lbs. On admission , she could not walk more than few feet w/o
SOB. Pt claimed that she was compliant with her medications and
practiced dietary
discretion. On day of present admission , pt presented w/CHF flare ,
acute
on chronic RF. In ED , BP 87/45 , P 75 , 96%RA , afeb. EKG showed AF with
no ST-T changes , enz neg. HCT 30.7 , BUN 105 , Cr
2.4 ( baseline Cr
~2.0 ) PE: AOx3 , resp distress , JVP? , S1S2 ,
3/6 AS murmur , trace rales , abd? , 3+ pitting LE
edema. Impression: 71yo woman w/CHF , AFib , AS , DM ,
CRI , w/hx of recent CHF exacerbation now p/w with
vol overload , dyspnea , and renal failure. Etiology of CHF exacerbation
unclear:she r/o for MI , no worsening of her afib , no si/sx's of
infection ,
no hx to suggest dietary indiscretion , medical non-compliance , lack of
medications CV:Isch- no evidence of ischemia: pt r/o for MI with
negative enzymes. PUMP: Pt was gently diuresed ~2L/day on Torsemide
100 IV TID x 4 days with excellent response and then switched to her
home diuretic regiment of 100 mg BID of PO torsemide and 5 mg PO
Zaroxolyn on the day prior to discharge still with good diuretic
effect. Her admission wt was 132.9KG and on day of discharge she
weighed 125.8kg: net total loss of 7.1 kg or 15.6 lbs per this admit.
During this admission , strict I/O's , daily weight. fluid
and salt restriction were maintained. She was not re-started on
Cozaar given BP's in low range with SBP:90;s. RHYTHM: chronic afib
w/good rate
control w/o agent and no rate issues during this admission. Pt is not
on coumadin given hx
of GI bleed. Pulm: Pt was continued on her Advair disk , flonase , prn
nebs. She was placed on CPAP @ night and did well with cpap;
arrangements were made for pt to have her CPAP at home changed to
hospital setting and equipment. HEME:1 )ANEMIA
Pt was admitted with HCT of 30.7 , lower then her normal. She had 3
positive stool guiaic's , low normal Fe
studies , and stable HCT during this admission. Her ASA was stopped 2/2
concern for GIB. Pt is scheduled to follow-up with her GI doctor , Dr. Ethan Wasowski 2 days after discharge.2 )THROMBOCYTOPENIA:pt had a drop in
platlets that was initially concerning , but ultimately appeared
to be lab variation with its resolution on the next blood
draw. RENAL:Pt was admitted with acute
on chronic renal failure felt to be secondary to decreased CO. Her CRT
elevation gradually resolved from 2.4 on admission to 1.8 at time of
discharge. Her celebrex was stopped 2/2 ARF.
Proph: Pt was placed on
Heparin 5000u SC BID for DVT prophylaxis and Nexium
40 GI:Pt was noted to have elevated LFT's on admission labs. Her peak
LFT's were ALT:368 , AST: 274 , AP:158 with nl BILIT 0.5 and biliD
0.3. DDX included congestion vs infection vs medications. hepatitis
deemed unlikely but hep panel still pending at time of discharge.
Since pt's LFT's did not resolve with excellent diuresis , it was felt
that it was not likely due to congestion. Most likely etiology was felt
to be reaction to drug. Pt was taken off the following hepatotoxic
meds: tylenol , statin , percocet , allopurinol. She was continued on her
tamoxifen , although case reports of hepatotoxicity noted; other
consideration included the neurontin , but lft's began to normalize on
medication. Pt is scheduled to follow-up with GI , Dr. Hornshaw 2
days following discharge. FEN: Pt's lytes were aggressively repleted;
she required significant K repletion each day and will be d/c'd on K.
She was maintained on a NA and fluid restriction and placed on a
cardiac and diabetic diet. ( ENDO ): DM: Pt was initially placed on RISS
given concern for hypogylcemia and her home regiment was gradually
added to her inpatient regiment with elevated FS.
Pt was stable at time of discharge , sx's much improved , and scheduled f
or follow-up with cardiologist and CHF nurse on 8/28/03.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1 )please stop the following medications: tylenol , percocet , Zocor ,
cozaar , celebrex , allopurinol , aspirin
2 )follow-up on your liver enzyme elevations and guiaic positive stools
with Dr. Kemfort
3 )if you have any worsening shortness of breath , fatigue , lower
extremity swelling , or any concerning symptoms , please call your doctor
immediately.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1 )follow-up for LFT elevations: hepatitis panel still pending at d/c
2 )follow-up for guiaic( + )stool and Hct drop
3 )The following medications were stopped during this admission given
concern re: elevated LFT's , ARF , and guiaic + stools: tylenol ,
percocet , zocor , cozaar , celebrex , allopurinol , ASA.

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS ( to CCU admission ):
The patient was admitted to IMH on 5/25/06. He had been behaving unlike
himself and was having black tarry stools for two days. The patient was found
to
be guaiac positive. A head CT showed no new lesions but did show
multiple infarcts that were known to be old. On 10/18/06 , the
patient had an EGD showing clot in the distal esophagus. This
clot was removed , and the possible culprit vessel was clipped.
Around midnight on 8/19/06 , the patient became borderline
hypertension for an unclear reason. His hematocrit was
stable. The patient's ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
were held. Also , the patient's Lasix was
held. On 8/19/06 at around 4:00 a.m. , the patient was
reportedly having fitful sleeping and went to the bathroom. Soon
afterwards , the nurse noticed that the patient was having more
ectopy on telemetry. Soon after 4:30 a.m. , the patient was
either found unresponsive or ventricular fibrillation was seen on
telemetry and a code was called. The rhythm was shown to be
V-fib. Chest compressions were initiated , and the patient was
shocked. Soon thereafter , he had two more shock episodes for
V-fib and was loaded on amiodarone 300 mg IV x1. Soon
thereafter , his V-fib terminated and subsequently , the patient
had an episode of slow PEA treated with atropine , epinephrine ,
calcium and magnesium. Code labs showed a potassium of 3.3. The
patient was intubated. A left femoral line was placed. The
patient was transported to the CCU with stable blood pressure on
neosynephrine. He was easily weaned off neosynephrine. The
patient does not have any history of an arrhythmia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
The patient's past medical history is significant for:;
1. coronary artery disease status post CABG ( SVG to RCA ) with mitral valve
replacement in 1999. In 2003 , the
patient underwent catheterization for unstable angina. The LAD
and D1 were stented. In 2004 , the patient underwent
catheterization for unstable angina showing restenosis of D1
which was re-stented.
2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
3. CVA.
4. Seizure disorder.
5. Subdural hematoma while on Coumadin , status post burr hole
evacuation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
On admission on 10/20/06 , the patient's vital signs were
temperature 98.3 , pulse 86 , blood pressure 122/73 , respiratory
rate 16 , O2 sat 97% on room air. He was not in any acute
distress. He was alert and oriented x3. He was interactive and
appropriate. Skin was normal. HEENT showed an old left-sided
facial droop which was unchanged per patient and the family. The
JVP was 6 cm. There was no lymphadenopathy. The chest was
clear. Cardiac exam showed a mechanical S1 and normal S2 , no
extra sounds or murmurs. Abdominal exam was benign. Extremities
had 2+ pulses without clubbing , cyanosis or edema. Neurological
exam showed a left-sided facial hemiparesis. Otherwise , cranial
nerves II through XII were intact. The patient had 4/5 strength
on the left side , 5/5 strength on the right side. Toes were
downgoing.
ADMISSION LABS:
Labs on admission were notable for a creatinine of 1.7 , glucose
of 237 , hematocrit of 37.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
10/18/06 , elective inpatient EGD for heme-positive black stool
performed by Dr. Marlin Shigo in the presence of Dr. Val Blache
On 11/16/06 , urgent cardiac cathet1erization for cardiac arrest
performed by Dr. Monte Lenig with stent placement in the
circumflex.
On 4/22/06 , dual chamber ICD placed by Dr. Danni
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
This is a 66-year-old man with coronary artery disease and
mitral valve replacement. He was initially admitted for an upper
GI bleed and was then admitted to the CCU status post V-fib arrest
and found to have NSTEMI. His course in the CCU was as follows:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: NSTEMI. The patient had a troponin elevation
beginning 15 minutes after a code was started , suggesting that the NSTEMI
occurred
and then caused V-fib arrest. The peak troponin was 111.
Cardiac catheterization showed severe 3-4 vessel disease ,
and occlusion of the SVG graft. Two drug-eluting stents were placed
in the left circumflex. The patient was treated with aspirin ,
Plavix , beta-blocker , and ACE. The patient's beta-blocker and
ACE doses were titrated during his hospital stay. The patient
was also taken off of Lipitor briefly due to concern about his
liver function. At discharge , he is being restarted on his
outpatient doses of Lipitor as well as a Fibrate.
B. Pump: The patient had congestive heart failure causing
pulmonary edema. By echo , he had an ejection fraction of 25-30%
with a moderately dilated left ventricle , severe global
hypokinesis with posterior and inferior akinesis. The patient
diuresed well during his CCU stay and on the floor. His I's and
O's were followed. He was net negative , and he was discharged
at a weight of 87 kilos. The patient had an echo to evaluate
for dyssynchrony. This echo did not find significant evidence of
dyssynchrony.
C. Rhythm: The patient had a V-fib arrest and returned to
normal sinus rhythm. He received an amiodarone load as well as
amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. After he stabilized , the amiodarone was
discontinued after AICD implantation on on 7/1/06. The implantation itself
was uncomplicated though the patient developed hives thought to be due to
administration of prophylactic Ancef. The patient was switched
to vancomycin for prophylaxis , followed by po clindamycin. His allergic
symptoms
resolved with one dose of IV Benadryl.
2. GI: The patient came in with an upper GI bleed. A bleeding
vessel at the GE junction was clipped. The patient had a
transient LFT elevation consistent with shock liver. LFTs were
followed and declined appropriately during his hospitalization
and normalized before discharge. The patient was also maintained
on a proton pump inhibitor during his stay.
3. Hematocrit: The patient was transfused two units of red blood
cells on 4/12/06 and 9/28/06. His hematocrit remained stable therafter. The
patient was taking Lovenox as an
outpatient for protection of his mechanical mitral valve. During
the peri-procedure period for his ICD implantation , the patient
was switched to heparin drip and was maintained on the heparin
drip for four days after device implantation. At that time , he
was restarted on his outpatient regimen of Lovenox 70 mg b.i.d.
4. Neuro: The patient has a history of CVA with a residual left
hemiparesis. These symptoms were stable. The patient was also
seen by the Psychiatry Service to evaluate his memory deficits
and abilities to make decisions. The Psychiatry team recommended
that the patient be followed by Neurology after discharge and
that the patient be considered for a formal neuropsychiatric
testing for evaluation of his neurologic and cognitive deficits.
5. Pulmonary: The patient's pulmonary edema resolved with
diuresis.
6. ID: The patient presented with fever and an elevated white
blood cell count initially and a question of an infiltrate on chest
x-ray. This patient was covered with levofloxacin and Flagyl for
three days empirically for aspiration pneumonia. During
hospitalization , he did have very transient low-grade
temperatures on two other occasions. Cultures including chest
x-ray , urine and blood cultures were negative. The patient was afebrile prior
to discharge. As of the day of
this dictation , C. difficile tests were also negative.
7. Renal: The patient's creatinine was elevated reaching a peak
of 1.9 on 4/12/06 in the setting of his cardiac arrest. The
patient's creatinine normalized and on the day prior to discharge
was 1.2.
8. Nutrition: The patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow.
Initially , he was put on a puree-thin diet that was advanced to
mechanical soft and thin liquids prior to discharge.
9. Endocrine: The patient is diabetic and was maintained on NPH
22 units b.i.d. and a sliding scale. At the time of discharge ,
the patient's blood sugars were well controlled. He is being
discharged on Lantus 48 units at bedtime ( a light increase over his outpatinet
dose ) as well as a NovoLog sliding scale for coverage during meals.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
On the day of discharge , the patient was afebrile. Heart rate
70-80s , blood pressure 90-120/66-70. Oxygen saturation 96-98% on
room air. Weight 87 kilograms. Pertinent labs include a
creatinine of 1.2 , hematocrit of 36. The patient's exam showed
continuing left facial hemiparesis. Lungs were clear. Cardiac
exam was notable for a mechanical S1 , no extra sounds or murmurs.
His abdomen was soft , and the ICD placement site was well healed
without swelling , tenderness or erythema.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 72-year-old woman with
history of diverticulitis who
presented with a diverticular abscess with nausea , vomiting and
crampy abdominal pain.

ALLERGIES: Sulfa , erythromycin , levofloxacin , IV dye , iron.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 72-year-old female with a history of
diverticulitis who presented with crampy
abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting times several days. CT on
admission noted a diverticular abscess. CT was unable to drain it
due to its limited size. However , the patient continued to have
crampy abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting. The patient was taken
to the OR on 10/19/01 for an exploratory laparotomy , sigmoid
colectomy and colostomy. The patient tolerated the procedure well
and was maintained NPO , with an epidural for pain control , until
return of bowel function as witnessed by the gas and feces in the
colostomy bag.
By the time of discharge , the patient was ambulating with a wheeled
walker. She was tolerating a regular diet , had good pain control
on 2-4 mg q.4h. of Dilaudid. Of note , the patient has a
significant history of coronary artery disease , had a rule out MI
postoperatively with initial evidence of cardiac injury. However ,
the patient did complain of some atypical chest pain on
postoperative day #3. A repeat rule out MI illustrated a troponin
leak likely secondary to increased cardiac demands postoperatively.
The patient was started on diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. in order to
control rates with a good effect. The patient was also continued
on a course of IV antibiotics , ampicillin , ceftazidime , Flagyl and
Diflucan. Drainage from that particular abscess eventually
revealed enterococci , yeast and Pseudomonas responsive to these
antibiotics.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST STENT OF
THE RCA.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: EXTENSIVE CARDIAC HISTORY , DVT WITH
PE X TWO , CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ,
HEPATITIS B POSITIVE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63-year-old male presenting
with unstable angina. His first presentation with coronary disease
was in 1986 , when he ruled in for MI and a cath revealed 100%
occlusion of the circumflex , 99% D1 , and a subsequent angioplasty
of the circ to a 70% residual. He had an exercise treadmill two
months later and a repeat cath at that time showed 95% restenosis
of the circ and a 60% LAD lesion , and a 90% D1. In October of
1992 the patient again presented with exertional angina. Cath
revealed 70% occlusion of the RCA , 70-80% LAD , and diffuse disease
in the circumflex with a 50% mid-circumflex lesion. He had diffuse
global hypokinesis and an EF of 40-50%. His angina progressed and
in 1994 he underwent a four vessel CABG , SVG to the PDA and OM-1 ,
and a LIMA to the LAD and D2. He did well until 1997 , when he
presented with presyncope and was found to have a massive saddle
pulmonary embolism. He had a negative hypercoagulative workup
after this. In the recent years he has had a number of episodes of
epigastric pain with exertion and positive stress tests , but no
additional myocardial infarctions. His most recent cath in July
of 1997 showed an occluded circumflex , 80% LAD , and subtotal
occlusion distally , a 60% mid-RCA lesion , and patent SVG to the PDA
and the OM , as well as the LIMA to the LAD. In recent months the
patient describes increasing frequency of anginal episodes provoked
by walking more than five minutes or climbing stairs. Most often
the pain is epigastric , but occasionally substernal. He denies
associated symptoms of nausea , diaphoresis , or radiation of the
pain , but says it is hard to catch his breath. The patient denies
orthopnea , PND , or lower extremity edema. He has never had pain at
rest. On February the patient underwent an exercise treadmill
test walking five minutes on the standard Bruce protocol , reaching
a heart rate of 96 and a blood pressure of 130/70. He had chest
pain as well as 1 mm ST depressions. Since then his angina has
occurred with less and less exertion until the morning of
admission , when he walked outside and experienced substernal chest
tightness. He again denies nausea , diaphoresis , palpitations , or
radiation of the pain , but does have some shortness of breath. The
pain lasts approximately 10-15 minutes and the patient was advised
by his cardiologist , Dr. Raymond Merrihew , to come to the Emergent
Department. In the Emergent Department he was pain free and
received aspirin and was started on heparin. EKG showed no acute
changes. CK was 47 and a troponin of 0.24.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , chronic DVTs with
pulmonary embolism x two , CVA , left temporal in the setting of an
INR of 4 , with some residual memory and expressive deficits. He is
now on Lovenox subcu for DVT prophylaxis. Chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , hepatitis B
positive , and recent eye surgery in January of 2001.
ALLERGIES: Benadryl , which causes shortness of breath.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glucophage 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Avandia 4
mg p.o. b.i.d. , atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day , aspirin 325 mg q. day ,
gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.6 , heart rate 60 , blood
pressure 110/90 , upper 70 , oxygen
saturation 98% on 2 L. In general , he is a 63-year-old Asian male ,
well appearing and in no acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal ,
round , and reactive. Extraocular muscles intact. Oral mucosa are
moist. There is no jugular venous distention , no lymphadenopathy.
Neck is supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , without
wheezes or rales. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm ,
without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , nondistended ,
and mildly tender to palpation in the epigastrium. There is no
rebound or guarding. Extremities are warm and well perfused , with
no edema.
INITIAL LABORATORIES: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 106 ,
bicarb 24 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.5 , glucose
253 , white count 5.3 , hematocrit 36.8 , platelets 144 , calcium 9.5 ,
mag 1.7 , CK 47 , troponin slightly elevated at 0.23 , INR 1.1. EKG
reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 , with normal axis and inferiorly
flattened T waves , with T in 1 , L in 6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascularly , the patient was continued
on heparin and ruled out for MI by CKs. On 10/21
he underwent cardiac catheterization , which showed an 80% proximal
LAD , 100% proximal circ , 80% proximal RCA , and 80% proximal right
PDA. His LIMA to the D2 and the LAD were patent , as was the SVG to
OM-1. The SVG to the RCA was 100% occluded. A stent was placed in
the native mid-RCA and angioplasty was undertaken of the right PDA.
After the procedure , the heparin was discontinued and he was
transitioned to Lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day for DVT prophylaxis. An
echo was obtained , which showed mildly enlarged left ventricle with
moderate reduction in function and EF of 35%. There is thinning
and hypokinesis to akinesis of the posterior and inferior segments ,
as well as hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal septum. The RV
was normal. Pulmonary artery pressures are 25+ right atrial
pressure. The patient continues to have episodes of epigastric
discomfort and belching , and his EKG revealed only nonspecific T
wave changes. He was scheduled to undergo a submax exercise
treadmill test , but this was held due to an increase in his
troponin initially from .23 to .73 , suggesting that he was having
some mild ischemia with the likely culprit being the small PDA that
had been angioplastied during cath. Recath was thought to be low
yield without anything to intervene upon after discussion with the
interventional Cardiology Service. His medical regimen was
maximized and included a beta blocker , ACE inhibitor , and nitrates.
His cardiac enzymes trended down to a CK of 32 and a troponin of
0.33 upon discharge. He underwent submaximum ETT on 3/10 and
walked for nine minutes without EKG changes , but did experience
6/10 chest pain and some belching. The test was considered
consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Of note , he
reached a max heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 142/80
during this submaximum stress test. The patient will be discharged
to home to have close follow-up with his cardiologist , Dr. Devin Peachey He will also have a follow-up stress test. He will see his
primary care physician , Dr. Panciera , for monitoring of his other
medical issues , including his diabetes. Discharge condition is
stable , discharge diet is low fat diabetic diet , and discharge
medications are enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , atenolol
50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 10 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg one

IMPRESSION: 58yo M s/p cardiac transplant c/b allograft vasculopathy ,
recent admission in 10/6 for pulmonary hemorrhage/PNA admitted with
increased SOB and hemoptysis. Likely CHF exacerbation +/- ILD +/- PNA
( CAP , atypicals , TB , PCP , fungal ). Patient's shortness of breath responded
to diuresis , and his symptoms improved. However bronchoscopy revealed
RML fresh blood , and CT chest is concerning for RML mass. Will need
follow up with pulmonary which is already arranged.
1. ) CV: No evidence of ischemia. Patient continued outpatient ASA ,
bblocker , statin , plavix. H/o cardiac transplant. Cyclosporine level on
10/27 was 152. His cyclosporine was increased during admission to 100mg po
BID. His sirolimus was discontinued.
PUMP- He was intially volume overloaded on exam. BNP on admission was 674.
He was diuresed with lasix 40mg po BID , and will be discharged on lasix
40mg po daily. Also given potassium 10meq a day , will need lytes
followed. His HCTZ was discontinued. Weight on day of discharge was
62.2kg. BP control with home regimen of dilt , lopressor , cadura.
2. ) PULM: Pulmonary was consulted. CT was negative for PE. He had a
bronchoscopy which was described above ( fresh blood oozing from RML ). BAL
was sent for multiple studies. PCP was negative , influenza negative , adeno
negative , viral studies , cultures , and cytology are pending at this time.
Galact Ag was negative. GBM antibody was negative. ANCA is pending.
Bronchoscopy and chest CT were concerning for RML mass. He will follow up
with a PET CT and Pulmonary appointment on 9/2/07. Allergy was consulted
re whether his symptoms could be an allergic pneumonitis ( given history of
ASA allergy , an previous desensitization , and they felt it was unlikely.
Rheumatology was consulted re possible vasculitis given new proteinuria -
thought unlikely although final consult recommendations were pending at
time of discharge. He will be discharged on oxygen given desat to 87% on
RA with ambulation. He will be treated empirically with levofloxacin x 14
day course to finish on 6/2/07 in case mass seen in RML is infectious.1
3. ) HEME: LENIs negative. has iron defiency anemia which will need to be
continued to follow.

ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HYPERTENSION; 2 ) HYPER-
CHOLESTEROLEMIA; 3 ) OBESITY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Alevras is a 45 year old gentle-
man with a long history of coronary
artery disease , the first admission to Sonsauon Hacent's Geka Medical Center
due to myocardial infarction was October , 1988. Coronary
angiography in 1988 revealed three vessel coronary artery disease
with ejection fraction of 45%. The next hospitalization at Lis Voylecrest Sut Medical Center in 1993 due to syncopal episode. Since the last
admission , Mr. Rodefer was doing well , essentially the same level
of symptoms. Objectively , however , there was evidence of
significant progression of coronary disease with Thallium images
suggestive of severe multivessel coronary artery disease and
developed LV dysfunction. Recent admission to Stere Mosesco Shantum Hospital Of for coronary artery catheterization and eventual
myocardial revascularization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 55 year old man , overweight. Blood
pressure 122/80 , heart rate 56 , regular.
Weight 204. Lungs clear. Jugular venous pressure not elevated at
30 degrees. Hepatojugular reflex is negative. Carotid upstroke
normal without bruits. Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs. Abdomen
obese , but otherwise benign. Peripheral pulses are intact
throughout. No pitting edema.
LABORATORY VALUES: White count 7 , 000 , hematocrit 42% ,
184 platelets. BUN 24 , creatinine
1.1 , 1.0 , glucose 101 and sodium 139 , potassium 4.4. PT 12.9 , PTT
25.4 , INR 1.2. EKG - sinus bradycardia and inferior myocardial
infarction. Cardiac catheterization report from the 25 of October ,
1995 revealed coronary artery disease with total occlusion of the
left anterior descending artery in its proximal portion , left
circumflex artery is small , non dominant and large obtuse marginal
branch and the right coronary artery totally occluded in its mid
portion. The left ventriculogram revealed markedly enlarged
ventricle with inferior hypokinesis and apical akinesis.
Calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 46%.
OPERATION: Coronary bypass to anterior
descending and posterior descending
arteries on the 22 of February , 1995 , surgeon was Dr. Bohs
POSTOPERATIVE COURSE: The patient was extubated on the
first postoperative day and
transferred to the ward. Further postoperative course was
uneventful so the patient could be discharged in good postoperative
condition on the fifth ( 5th ) postoperative day.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old lady with
known history of coronary artery
disease , who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x three in
1989 , with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal , and
saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery. In the last
four months , she experienced chest tightness and dyspnea on
exertion , and during the last month , her fatigue was extreme. The
patient was admitted on 7/22/96 to Missi.ell Hospital where an
echocardiogram revealed low-normal ejection fraction with severe
aortic stenosis and mild aortic insufficiency. Aortic valve area
was calculated on 0.8 square centimeters. Cardiac catheterization ,
performed in the same hospital , revealed an ejection fraction of
66% with normal pulmonary artery pressures , aortic valve area of
0.6 square centimeters , and gradient across the valve of 44 mm
of Hg. Native coronary artery disease showed 70% stenosis of the
left main , occluded left anterior descending , 50% stenosis of the
obtuse marginal , and 70% stenosis of the right coronary arteries.
The graft to the left anterior descending and to to the OM1 were
patent. The saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery was
occluded.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. Micronase. Lasix
40 mg q. d. Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.

Discharge Date: 11/2/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Atrial flutter. 2. Congestive heart
failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67-year-old male with
a history of congestive heart failure
and history of atrial flutter in September of 1998. The patient was
admitted to Cardiology for treatment of atrial flutter and
worsening congestive heart failure. The patient initially
presented to Aler Hospital in September of 1998 with
acute shortness of breath and atrial flutter. Chest x-ray at that
time showed congestive heart failure. The patient was initially
rate controlled with Verapamil and Digoxin and converted to normal
sinus rhythm. However , on Digoxin , the patient developed
junctional tachycardia , which reverted back to normal sinus rhythm
after Digoxin was discontinued. Echocardiogram at that time showed
an ejection fraction of 35%. The patient was discharged on 11 of May
in normal sinus rhythm. The patient was discharged on Lopressor ,
Verapamil , Aspirin , and Coumadin , which was stopped five months
ago. The patient did extremely well after discharge until about
five days ago when he ran out of his Atenolol , which he had not
taken since then. Over the past week , the patient had extreme
fatigue and dyspnea on exertion , which steadily worsened. Today ,
the patient was taking out the trash and experienced a few seconds
of chest heaviness on the left side , without any radiation. The
patient reported being short of breath , but had no other symptoms.
Upon trying to the mailbox , the patient was extremely short of
breath and fell to the ground , but had no loss of consciousness.
There was no warning or dizziness. The patient was brought to
Tien Medical Center Emergency Department. There , the patient was
noted to be in atrial flutter at a rate of 150. The patient was
given IV Lopressor , 5 mg , and his heart rate came down to 106.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A review of systems was positive for three
pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and increasing
lower extremity swelling over the past week. The patient denied
any fever , chills , night sweats , or change in bowel movements.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history was significant for
high blood pressure , left ankle and left knee arthritis ,
questionable history of gout , gonococcal urethritis ,
diverticulosis , elevated cholesterol , and cardiomyopathy with
ejection fraction of 35% by echocardiogram in September of 1998.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS
ON ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patient was on
Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day , Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q. day ,
Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day , which the patient self discontinued
five days prior to admission , Lisinopril 20 mg q. day , Aspirin ,
B12 , Folate , and Multivitamins. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient's
social history was significant for tobacco , one pack per day for
forty years. The patient quit in February of 1998. Alcohol was
significant for two to three drinks per day , with none since
September of 1998. There was no history of drug use. The patient
lives in Derdflintvo alone. The patient is a retired social worker.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's family history was significant for a
mother with a myocardial infarction at 60 , brother with myocardial
infarction at 54 , and father who is deceased from cerebrovascular
accident.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , the patient was
afebrile. The heart rate was 115 , blood
pressure 150/100 , and saturation 95% on 2 liters. In general , the
patient was alert and oriented and in no acute distress. HEENT
revealed the patient to be normocephalic , atraumatic. The pupils
were equal , round and reactive to light. The extraocular movements
were intact. The oropharynx was moist. The neck was supple
without bruits. The chest was clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a 1/6 holosystolic murmur. The
patient was in atrial flutter. The abdominal examination was
benign. The extremities showed 1+ edema bilaterally. There was no
clubbing or cyanosis. Electrocardiogram on admission showed atrial
flutter at rate of 50 , as well as left axis deviation , right bundle
branch block , left ventricular hypertrophy with QRS widening , old
inferior myocardial infarction , and right bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion ,
consistent with congestive heart failure , and bilateral pleural
effusions.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data on admission showed sodium 146 ,
potassium 4.4 , creatinine 1.2 , white blood cell
count 6.7 , hematocrit 42.5 , CK 95 , and troponin 0.05.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology floor
for treatment of atrial flutter and congestive
heart failure. The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction. It was felt that the patient's worsening congestive
heart failure was likely secondary to his flutter. The patient was
started on Lasix in addition to being started on a beta blocker.
However , the patient remained in atrial flutter with poor rate
control. Echocardiogram on 7 of September showed an ejection fraction of
30-35% with global hypokinesis. Of note , also , the patient's
ventricular myocardium showed an echo bright appearance consistent
with possible infiltrative disease. On 14 of October , the patient
underwent cardioversion without complications , as he was still in
atrial flutter and was not having good rate control. The patient
was successfully cardioverted and remained in sinus rhythm
afterwards. However , on 23 of May , the patient was still significantly
short of breath and hypoxic. This was felt probably likely
secondary to fluid overload , and the patient was started on Lasix.
However , the patient underwent a VQ scan and was ruled out for
pulmonary embolism. The patient did well and , on 6 of April , the patient
experienced bilateral lip swelling , consistent with angioedema.
The patient's Lasix and Captopril were discontinued , as it was
unclear which agent had caused this , however , it was most likely
the Captopril. This responded well to Benadryl. The patient was
started on ethacrynic acid and Hydralazine for diuresis and
afterload reduction. The patient did well on this regimen. On
26 of February , the patient was discharged home in stable condition. The
patient was in sinus rhythm and was satting well on room air.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patient
was on Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg
inhaled q. 4-6 hours as needed for wheezing , Enteric coated aspirin
325 mg p.o. q. day , Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day , Edecrin 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day , Hydralazine 10 mg p.o. q.i.d. ,
Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q. day , and
Benadryl 50 mg p.o. q. 6 hours as needed for lip swelling.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr. Kotow
in one week. DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with
services , to be followed by Aflintsa Mo Hendco VNA for blood pressure and
weight checks q.o.d.

ATTENDING: TRENTHAM , DEL GUADALUPE MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Klaja is an 81-year-old gentleman
whose chief complaint was abdominal pain and diarrhea. He had a
past medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and recent
complex medical history including a septic right knee arthritis
with MRSA complicated by a PICC line-induced right upper extremity
DVT followed by bacteremia with multi-resistant Klebsiella
pneumoniae , treated with meropenem for 14 days with the course
ending on 11/11/2006. The patient presented with left lower quadrant abdominal
pain during his last admission 2 weeks ago associated with low-volume mucus
diarrhea , C. diff toxin assay was at that time negative on 1/24
Abdominal CT showed diverticulosis with stranding of the sigmoid colon.
Blood cultures grew klebsiella , treated with 14 days of meropenem
as previously noted. However , since this discharge , the mild
abdominal pain persisted. He continues to have low-grade mucus
diarrhea about 5 times a day , not associated with fever , chills
or anorexia. Over the last 2 days prior to this admission , the
diarrhea became high volume , still nonbloody and not associated
again with fever or chills. He was brought into the emergency
department at which time , he was afebrile with a blood pressure
of 85/49 , heart rate in the 80s , respiratory rate of 20 , O2
saturation 93% on room air. At that time , he received volume
resuscitation with 2 liters of IV fluids , stool samples for C.
diff assay were sent. He received empiric therapy with p.o.
vancomycin. An abdominal CT in the emergency department showed
thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectum.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease as noted
with an anterior MI in 2003 , that had complicated to VT arrest ,
status post CABG in 2003 that was a left internal mammary artery
to LAD with saphenous vein graft to the PTA and obtuse marginal.
He has had a catheterization in 3/12 that showed patent grafts
and drug-eluting stent to the left circumflex. He has chronic
kidney disease , baseline creatinine between 1.3 and 1.5 ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , C. diff colitis in 2003 , BPH ,
asthma , GERD , status post right upper extremity PICC-related DVT
and right knee septic arthritis.
MEDICATIONS: aspirin 81 mg , Plavix 75 mg , Coumadin 5 mg , digoxin 0.125 mg ,
Lasix 49 mg daily , lisinopril 10 mg daily , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 80 mg
daily , Flomax 0.4 mg daily and Flovent 110 mcg b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: penicillin which caused hives and swelling.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He previously a smoker. He does not drink. He
is a nursing home resident.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease , two
brothers who had coronary artery disease in their 60s. No family
history of cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vitals as previous noted , blood pressure
in the 80s/49 , heart rate 80 , regular , respiratory rate 20 , O2
saturation 93% on room air. Patient was afebrile. Pertinent
physical findings included: Pulmonary: He had a prolonged
expiratory phase , but no crackles. Cardiovascular: Distant heart
sounds , regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No rubs or
gallops. Systolic ejection or murmur 3/6 at the left lower
sternal border. Abdomen: Obese , distended abdomen , left lower
quadrant tenderness to palpation. No rebound at this time.
Extremities are warm , 2+ pulses with 1+ bilateral lower extremity
edema to the shins. Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3 , cranial
nerves grossly intact , no abnormalities.
admission abdominal CT showed bowel wall thickening in
the descending sigmoid colon and rectum. Chest x-ray showed
left-sided pleural effusion , atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs were significant for a white count of
15.7 , hematocrit of 35.5 and INR of 3.2. Electrolytes were
normal.
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU for hypertension and
infectious etiology. He was stabilized there and transferred to
the floor within a few days.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Colitis , presumed infectious etiology , descending and sigmoid
colon. Colitis was worse over the last month , associated with
diarrhea. Abdominal CT is consistent with an infectious
inflammatory bowel process. Given history of C. diff colitis , C.
diff was the most likely infectious etiology , but others were
possible. Ischemic colitis was considered secondary to low
forward flow , given patient's cardiomyopathy and low ejection
fraction of 20% to 35% and he also got a pattern of inflammatory
colitis or nonspecific colitis. Stool samples were sent for a C.
diff toxin and assay and all were negative x at least 3 samples.
Stool cultures were sent and did not grow anything out during
admission. Empiric treatment was started with p.o. vancomycin.
Patient's abdominal pain continued to improve and completely
resolved. By discharge , patient remained afebrile and white
blood cell count decreased. Advance patient's diet as tolerated
and by discharge the patient was up to soft solids. We added
lactobacillus p.o. for probiotics and patient also had flex sig
two days before discharge , showing resolving inflammation
consistent with colitis of inflammatory etiology. The flex sig
did not change his management. We did discharge the patient on a
2-week course p.o. vancomycin alone.
2. Coronary artery disease. Patient had no evidence for acute
coronary syndrome on admission. We continued his aspirin ,
Plavix , statin and beta-blocker. Patient had no ischemic issues
or coronary artery disease issues during his admission.
3. CHF. Patient has previous EF noted at 20% to 35% , so a
gentle hydration therapy at first in the MICU for hypertension
and then as patient's blood pressure increased , was able to
restart patient's Lasix dose in order to diurese all of the extra
fluid gained during the rehydration therapy , was restarted on the
Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily , his daily dose at home. Also considered
restarting lisinopril , but deferred discharge to outpatient
follow up with primary care physician for restart of lisinopril ,
once patient is fully recovered.
4. Chronic kidney disease. Patient had a baseline of creatinine
1.2 to 1.5 and he came into the hospital with a creatinine of 1.0.
The patient was below baseline and remained below baseline during
admission. He did not have any renal issues.
5. Hematology. Patient has a history a line-induced DVT , has
been treated with Coumadin , with no definitive evidence as to how
along patient should be treated , given that the DVT was line
induced. Coumadin was therapeutic on admission , became
supertherapeutic in the MICU. Held Coumadin until INR fell below
3 , restarted Coumadin afterwards at 6 mg p.o. daily , patient's
normal dose. Patient was therapeutic on discharge. Will follow
up with primary care physician for Coumadin monitoring.
6. Nutrition. Patient was in the MICU and was n.p.o. given
abdominal pain and colitis. When transferred to floor , was
started on liquid diet and advanced to soft solid diet. By
discharge , the patient did not have abdominal pain and most of
the diarrhea had resolved.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED: The patient had a flexible sigmoidoscopy
during the admission that showed colitis consistent with
inflammatory etiology.
DIAGNOSIS: Patient had repeated negative C. diff toxin assays ,
but colitis was presumed to be C. diff and given history , could
have been other infectious or inflammatory etiologies. Patient
continued to improve on vancomycin and thus was discharged with
presumed C. diff colitis diagnosis.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Included aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , Plavix
75 mg p.o. daily , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily , Nexium 20 mg p.o.
daily , Flovent 110 mcg inhale b.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily ,
lactobacillus 2 tabs p.o. t.i.d. , metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
simvastatin 80 mg p.o. at bed time , Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. every
evening , vancomycin 250 mg p.o. every 6 hours x8 days at
discharge and Coumadin 5 mg p.o. every evening.
Patient had to follow up with primary care physician , setup for 2
to 3 weeks after discharge.

glucose 114 , total protein 4.9 , amylase 16 , LDH 38. There were 756
white blood cells on differential , of which 93% macrophages and 7%
mesothelioma cells , 127 , 000 red blood cells , and the fluid was
grossly blood. Cultures from the fluid were negative for bacteria
and fungal growth. Gram stain showed no organisms , no
polymorphonuclear cells. Vancomycin was redosed to 1 gram every 48
hours secondary to increased creatinine and elevated levels. Given
his recent requirement for debridement , vancomycin will be
continued for 2 weeks after discharge. Ofloxacin will also be
continued for the same. All cultures from this hospitalization are
negative to date.
2. Cardiovascular. The patient ruled out for myocardial
infarction. VQ scan was low probability on admission. This was
performed secondary to his baseline tachycardia. Lower extremity
noninvasive studies and ultrasound were done and were negative for
deep vein thrombosis. The patient's triponin on admission was 0.0.
The patient was aggressively diuresed as a component of his initial
dyspnea on exertion was likely secondary to a degree of congestive
heart failure. His admission weight was 100.6 kilograms , and
weight on discharge was 95.8 kilograms. With aggressive diuresis
during hospitalization , Lasix was discontinued on the day prior to
discharge. Digoxin level on admission was 0.6 , on discharge was
1.0. The patient had several episodes of hypotension with systolic
blood pressure in the mid 70's to low 80's. Captopril and
Lopressor were decreased and held at certain stages during his
hospitalization. On discharge , he was on a stable dose of
Captopril , 6.25 milligrams 3 times a day , and Lopressor , 12.5
milligrams twice a day. He was not orthostatic on the day prior to
discharge.
3. Renal. The patient was aggressively diuresed. His BUN and
creatinine rose from 12 and 1.2 on admission , to a peak of 36 and
2.6 on 20 of November Subsequently , the creatinine has declined , and on
9 of July , BUN was 37 , creatinine 2.2. The patient had an
eosinophilia , which peaked at 18% on 16 of March , and subsequently
decreased to 11% on discharge. Urine eosinophils were not present.
It appeared that his eosinophilia was related to ceftazidime , which
was discontinued on 24 of January It is unlikely that his increasing
renal insufficiency is secondary to acute tubular necrosis. More
likely , it is secondary to the aggressive diuresis undertaken to
decrease his congestive heart failure. Follow-up laboratory values
will likely reveal improvement in BUN and creatinine status , as
well as a decrease in his peripheral eosinophilia.
4. Psychiatry. The patient has had anxiety , especially at night ,
and has been treated successfully with Ativan , but Serax resulted
in nightmares. The patient has a history of depression and may
benefit from counseling. The patient's decreased oral intake ,
nightmares , and anxiety may all be related to an underlying
depressive component over his prolonged illness.
5. Endocrine. The patient's blood sugar levels have been well
controlled on a regimen of NPH , 20 each morning. He has not
required any additional coverage , and regular insulin coverage has
been discontinued for 2 days.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is fair. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE are Tylenol , 650 milligrams by mouth every
4 hours as needed for headache , enteric-coated aspirin , 325
milligrams by mouth each day , Captopril , 6.25 milligrams by mouth
every 8 hours , held if systolic blood pressure is less than 85 ,
digoxin , 0.125 milligrams by mouth each day , Benadryl , 25 to 50
milligrams by mouth every 4 hours as needed for itching , Colace ,
100 milligrams by mouth twice a day , NPH insulin , 20 units
subcutaneously each morning , Atrovent inhaler , 2 puffs 4 times a
day , Ativan , 0.5 to 1 milligram by mouth every 6 hours as needed
for anxiety and insomnia , Lopressor , 12.5 milligrams by mouth twice
a day , held for systolic blood pressure less than 80 or heart rate
less than 60 , Niferex , 150 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
Percocet , 1 or 2 tablets by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain ,
Sarna lotion topically to back as needed , vancomycin , 1 gram
intravenously every 48 hours times 10 days , Axid , 150 milligrams by
mouth twice a day , ofloxacin , 200 milligrams by mouth twice a day
times 7 days.
The patient will be transferred to Manhill County Hospital
on 5 of September He will have a FOLLOW-UP appointment with Dr. Andaverde
in approximately 2 weeks.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Buetti is a 58-year-old man with a
history of ischemic cardiomyopathy
dating back several years. He developed angina in 1983 and
underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with a LIMA to LAD ,
SVG to the diag 1 , OM1 and PDA. He did relatively well after that
and then developed dyspnea on exertion. He underwent cardiac
catheterization in 3/5 but only the SVG to the PDA was diffusely
diseased. He then had a myocardial infarction in October of 1999
and apparently underwent another coronary artery bypass graft at
the Mitho General Health The anatomy of this is unknown. He felt
well postoperatively , but began to develop shortness of breath and
orthopnea in the last few months. He denies any chest pain ,
palpitations or syncope and is sometimes dizzy when he walks. He
is not admitted for optimization , his medications , tailored
therapy , and a transplant evaluation.

Discharge Date: 5/25/1996
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Jerrold Koterba is a 78 year old
gentleman with known coronary artery
disease who underwent coronary artery catheterization one month
prior to the most recent admission , and was found to have two
vessel coronary artery disease. The medical treatment was
attempted following cardiac catheterization which has not
eliminated his angina. He was admitted to the hospital with
unstable angina after conservative therapy. On echocardiogram from
July , 1996 , he had a moderately depressed left ventricular
function and ejection fraction of 45 percent. Coronary
catheterization showed 90 percent stenosis of the left anterior
descending coronary artery , occluded circumflex artery , and mild
disease of his right coronary artery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: The patient is a well-appearing
78 year old gentleman. Head
and neck supple. No bruits over the carotid arteries. Heart , S1
and S2 are clear , no murmurs. The lungs with discrete wheezes over
both sides. The abdomen is soft , non-tender , benign , no
organomegaly. Extremities , no edema , no varicosities.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass
grafting x two with reverse vein graft to the
second obtuse marginal graft and the left anterior descending
coronary artery on July , 1996 , the surgeon was Dr. Avenia The
patient's postoperative recovery in the Intensive Care Unit was
uncomplicated. The patient was extubated on the first
postoperative day and transferred to the Floor. Further recovery
on the Floor was not associated with any significant complications.
The patient regained a significant level of his preoperative
physical activity , and was able to be discharged out of the
hospital on May , 1996 in stable postoperative condition on the
following medications.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg q.d.; Lasix 40 mg q.d.;
insulin 60 units q.a.m.; metoprolol 50 mg

ATTENDING: BURT EVERETT PENISSON M.D.
DISCHARGE DATE: To be determined.
SERVICE: GMS Ra
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Failure to thrive.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure ,
hypercholesterolemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , venous
stasis , postherpetic neuralgia , atrial fibrillation , and urinary
tract infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 87-year-old female with a
history of congestive heart failure , atrial fibrillation status
post pacemaker placement , and chronic venous stasis who presents
with nausea , vomiting , and failure to thrive. The patient was
recently admitted to Tapo Waycent Smouthnew Community Hospital in early
October with a congestive heart failure exacerbation and lower
extremity cellulitis. She was treated with diuresis ( ultimately
with ethacrynic acid as she developed a rash on torsemide and
itching with Lasix ) and a seven-day course of levofloxacin. At
the end of this admission , she was sent to a rehabilitation
facility. The patient had returned on the day of admission to
see her primary care physician. She had been vomiting and
appears severely dehydrated. She reported nausea and vomiting
for eight to nine days , intermittent nonbloody , nonbilious. She
also reported dysphagia for the last two months. She describes
recent dysuria. She also states that she has had no bowel
movement for a week prior to admission. She has had flatus. She
also complains of a baseline right ear pain due to her
postherpetic neuralgia. She has significantly decreased p.o.
intake with increasing generalized weakness. She denies chest
pain or shortness of breath.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure ,
hypercholesterolemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , venous
stasis , T6 fracture and lower back pain , history of herpes zoster
with postherpetic neuralgia affecting the right face and ear ,
atrial fibrillation status post pace replacement , and history of
guaiac-positive stools.
MEDICATIONS: Colace , senna , lisinopril 5 mg q. day , Lopressor 25
mg b.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pain , OxyContin 10 mg
q.12h. , calcium 500 mg t.i.d. , Neurontin 100 mg b.i.d. , Fosamax
70 mg q. week , Protonix 40 mg q. day , and ethacrynic acid 25 mg
b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Lasix , torsemide , penicillin , erythromycin , capsicum ,
and quinidine.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Recently at the Orva Sonapa Alblands in
ME , otherwise , lives alone in Rham En Ma At baseline is
ambulatory with a walker. Remote history of tobacco , quit 50
years ago. No history of alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Asthma and heart disease in three brothers.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 96 , heart rate
81 , blood pressure 119/56 , respiratory rate of 20 , O2 sat 99% on
room air. The patient is alert , but uncomfortable and ill
appearing. HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact. Mucous membranes are dry.
Oropharynx is otherwise clear. There is ptosis of the right lid
( baseline ) and exquisite tenderness over the right base and right
ear. Neck: JVP is 7 cm. Neck is otherwise supple with no
tenderness to palpation. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Lungs are clear
to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft , nontender ,
nondistended with normal active bowel sounds. Foley in place
draining a dark , cloudy urine. Extremities: Violaceous skin
changes of the legs bilaterally. 2+ edema. There is an area of
erythema in the left medial great toe , but no evidence of
infected ulceration. Neuro: Alert and oriented x3. Cranial
nerves intact ( except right lid ptosis ). The patient did not
feel well enough to cooperate with a full neurologic exam , but
her strength was symmetric throughout.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for a chemistry panel within
normal limits. BUN was 22 , creatinine 1.1 , white count was
13.27 , hematocrit 41.4 , platelets 448 , 000 , ALT 25 , AST 35 ,
alkaline phosphatase 339 , total bilirubin 1.0 , albumin 4.0 ,
amylase 39 , and lipase 14.
IMPRESSION: An 87-year-old female presenting with nausea ,
vomiting , and dehydration as well as dysuria , most likely mainly
due to urinary tract infection secondary to chronic Foley
placement.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: No acute issues. The patient was continued on her
beta-blocker. No aspirin was given , as the patient is on
Coumadin and has a history of guaiac-positive stool.
b. Pump: The patient was dry on admission in the setting of
nausea , vomiting , and decreased p.o. intake. Her last echo
showed an EF of 55% presumed diastolic dysfunction ,
mild-to-moderate MR as well as pulmonary hypertension of unclear
etiology ( pulmonary artery pressure was 64 mmHg plus right atrial
pressure ). Initially , the patient's ethacrynic acid was held
given dehydration , but was restarted towards the end of her
admission and titrated out to b.i.d. dosing to maintain a
slightly negative fluid balance. The patient was also continued
on her beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor after she was adequately
hydrated for blood pressure control.
c. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. She has a pacer placed and is V-paced. She is on
Coumadin with her INR at goal.
2. Pulmonary: The admission chest x-ray was read as a streaky
opacity of the right lung base possibly representing an
infiltrate , but curve has been artifact due to low lung volume.
The patient had no clinical evidence of pneumonia ( no cough , lung
exam clear ).
3. GI: The patient had nausea , vomiting for several days prior
to admission with decreased p.o. intake. She also reported no
bowel movement in the last weeks prior to admission. A KUB was
obtained on admission , which showed no evidence of obstruction or
free air. The patient was given stool softeners and laxatives
p.r.n. and began to have her regular bowel movements. She was
continued on Nexium for her history of gastroesophageal reflux
disease. The patient's nausea and vomiting improved overall
throughout her admission , however , intermittently returned.
There is no clear cause for this nausea and vomiting , but it was
thought likely to be a contribution of her opioid medications ,
which were increased early on in her hospitalization to address
her postherpetic neuralgia. The patient's nausea improved with
Reglan. Nausea , vomiting was improved on the day of discharge.
The patient had significantly better p.o. intake. The patient
also complained of dysphagia for two months prior to admission ,
this occurred mainly with solid foods. Per Speech and Swallow ,
the patient was initially on a soft mechanical/thin liquid diet
and is concerned for an obstructive lesion. A video swallow was
obtained on 3/4/05. This study showed no aspiration and normal
passage of fluid of varying consistencies ( although a note was
made of cricopharyngeal prominence ). Speech and Swallow
recommended a minced solid/thin liquid diet , which the patient
has tolerated well. The patient has a history of an elevated
alkaline phosphatase ( with elevated GGT ) of unclear etiology.
Abdominal ultrasound on her last admission in October 2005
showed gallstones , but no other process to explain the
abnormalities in alkaline phosphatase. The patient had no right
upper quadrant pain on this admission.
4. Renal/FEN: The patient was initially given intravenous
fluids for dehydration. She was also found to have a urinary
tract infection and was initially started on levofloxacin
empirically. The urine culture returned was Staph aureus ( the
patient has had indwelling Foley ) and the patient was switched to
doxycycline ( the patient is allergic to sulfa drugs , penicillin ,
and erythromycin ). Blood cultures were negative. The patient
has been afebrile through this admission. She was also noted to
have a urinary retention on a few occasions where an attempt was
made to remove her Foley catheter. This was thought most likely
due to urinary tract infection and to use opioid medications.
The patient will be discharged to rehab with her Foley in place
and is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Urology on
October , 2005.
5. Neuro: The patient has postherpetic neuralgia affecting her
right face/ear. She was admitted on OxyContin and oxycodone ,
which was titrated out in an attempt to make her more comfortable
and Neurontin was also titrated out with good effect on her pain.
Given her nausea and urinary retention , the patient's opioid
medications were decreased. A trial of a lidoderm patch on the
affected area was attempted prior to discharge.
6. Heme: The patient's INR was at goal ( 2 to 3 ) on Coumadin for
her history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was on Nexium and Coumadin.
8. Code status: DNR/DNI.
9. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility. She will follow up with her primary
care doctor Dr. Eddie Nitterhouse In addition , an appointment has
been made for her to see Dr. Nang on January , 2005 at 9:30
a.m. In addition , an appointment has been made with Dr. Storch
in Neurology on October , 2005 at 11:15 a.m. and it is requested
that the patient's basic metabolic panel be monitored while she
is on ethacrynic acid. In addition , her weight should be
followed daily to check for fluid accumulation. She will also
benefit from physical therapy as she is deconditioned. The
patient is stable at the time of this dictation.
The discharge medications will be dictated in an addendum to this
discharge summary.

a history of chronic renal insufficiency , elevated ammonia levels
chronically , CAD , ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40% in
LVH , recently discharged from Longlate General Medical Center on 7/10
and subsequently transferred to Ieu University Medical Center The patient
presents with increased shortness of breath. The prior admission
was related to renal failure and increased encepholopathy ( no
dictated summary available ). The patient reported doing well in
rehab for several days. However , over the past 2-3 days the
patient developed increased shortness of breath , and dyspnea on
exertion with very minimal movement. The patient reports stable
two pillow orthopnea. No upper respiratory symptoms. No fevers ,
chills , nausea or vomiting. The patient without palpitation.
The patient does report that shortness of breath was increased
over past baseline. The patient also notes noted increased
hematuria , although the patient has had a chronic hematuria for
over 1-2 years per patient. The patient does report that he had
a Foley in during the prior admission , and has had increased
hematuria since that discharge. The patient denies chest pain.
The patient was felt to have ""crackles"" at the rehab , and was
sent to the Ridwill Child for further care. In ED
the patient was afebrile , heart rate of 74 , blood pressure
127/75 , and satting 95% on room air. He was given 80 IV Lasix ,

LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 103 , CO2
26 , BUN 64 , creatinine 4.0 ( baseline creatinine of 3.7 - 3.9 ) ,
albumin 3.4 , white count of 7.1 , hematocrit of 33.5 , platelets of
137 , ( baseline hematocrit usually 32-35 ) , LFTs within normal
limits ( ALT , AST , alk phos , T bili ). First set of ED enzymes
were negative. BNP elevated at 655. Ammonia elevated at 83.
INR 1.2 , PTT 36.
Chest x-ray revealed enlarged central pulmonary arteries which
were suggestive of pulmonary hypertension in this patient with
obstructive sleep apnea , left base subsegmental atelectasis. EKG
first degree AV block , left axis deviation , a left ??anticular??
vesicular block , no ST or T-wave changes. UA with 3+ blood ,
15-20 white blood cells , trace bacterial. Of note , renal
ultrasound on 9/29/03 ( prior admission )I revealed no
hydronephrosis , distended gallbladder with multiple small stones.
ETT MIBI on 9/14/03 stress images only performed revealed small
area of myocardial scar in mid LAD/diagonal territory with
moderate stress induced peri-infarct ischemia. Echo performed
2/25/03 revealed an EF of 45-50% , positive LVH. Inferior and
lateral hypokinesis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Ischemia: The patient with a history of CAD and positive
MIBI in 10/10 The patient with no EKG changes , and also no
chest pain. The patient initially continued on aspirin , beta
blocker and a statin. On 8/25/03 the patient with a troponin
leak ( peak of .84 ) which subsequently trended down. The patient
also had had a prior troponin leak prior to the previously
described MIBI. At that time cardiology was following and
recommended medical management secondary to difficulty with
aggressive intervention in this patient. For this admission ,
cardiology was again consulted and cardiology recommended doing a
repeat MIBI to assess. The MIBI was completed on 3/28/03 and
results are pending at the time of this dictation. Again , very
difficult to perform intervention secondary to habitus.
Continued aspirin , beta blocker and statin. To follow up with
Cardiology for further read of the MIBI test. Pump: The patient
with elevated BNP and some fluid overload. Chest x-ray as
described above ( also a question of small pleural effusion slowly
improved from before ). It was felt that the patient's shortness
of breath could be secondary to increased pulmonary edema. So ,
the patient's Lasix was increased to 80 mg p.o. t.i.d. ( from
b.i.d. dosing ). Prior echo is as described above , revealing an
EF of 45%. The patient did have successful diuresis on the
increased Lasix dosing. On 1/24 the Lasix was lowered back to
b.i.d. dosing since the patient's creatinine began to rise.
Creatinine normalized to patient's baseline on 10/14 At time of
discharge the patient is on a home regimen of Lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d. Rhythm: The patient with a history of VT and the patient
was continued on sotalol , and monitored on telemetry without
alarms.
2. Pulmonary: The patient with shortness of breath increased
over baseline and chest x-ray as described above. Secondary to
the elevated BNP and increased lower extremity edema , the patient
was diuresed as described above. The patient does use BiPAP at
night for obstructive sleep apnea.
3. Endocrine: The patient with diabetes on insulin sliding
scale and a.m. NPH. No ace inhibitor was added secondary to the
significantly elevated creatinine. The patient's NPH was
increased to 10 units q.a.m. secondary to elevated sugars
( resulting in more improved glycemic control ).
4. Renal: The patient with chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of approximately 4. This is likely secondary
to several factors , including diabetes , effects of paraprotein
associated with monoclonal gammopathy ( obesity ). The patient was
continued on Phoslo , Calcitriol and Epogen. The patient also
with increased hematuria , and this was discussed with urology.
Previously extensive urological workup ( including cystoscopy ) was
largely negative but were poor studies secondary to large
habitus. Urology attending was not comfortable with aggressive
intervention at this time , and thought hematuria was likely
secondary to significant BPH ( and associated engorged veins ).
The patient is status post Targis procedure as described above ,
and hematuria secondary to recent Foley trauma from past
admission. The patient to follow up with urology in the future.
A urine cytology was obtained and is pending at this time.
5. GI: The patient with elevated ammonia levels , with normal
LFTs. This has also been worked up in the past according to the
patient which resulted in no clear diagnosis. The patient is too
obese for any abdominal imaging per CT. The patient does have a
history of multiple myeloma which could be the source of elevated
ammonia , versus a hepatic source. Ammonium level was 83. The
patient had no asterixis and had normal mentation while inhouse.
The patient's medication of Lactulose was continued.
6. Heme: The patient with chronic anemia as described in the
lab section. The patient did have an episode of epistaxis that
subsequently resolved , and hematuria as described above , though
also somewhat improved at time of discharge. Hematocrit was
stable throughout this , and there was no need for transfusion.
7. Oncology: The patient with a history of IgA monoclonal
gammopathy status post Cytoxan therapy. The oncologist
attending , Dr. Burrows , who knows the patient felt there was
no need for additional chemo at this time. Previous Cytoxan
therapy has not been significantly effective.
8. Neuro: The patient also complaining of muscle weakness ,
proximal muscles greater than distal muscles. A neurology
consult was called , who felt that this was largely secondary to
deconditioning and secondary to patient's multiple comorbidities ,
this is not likely secondary to a myositis. No further workup
was performed.
PLAN TO DO: The patient to be discharged to rehabilitation for
further care , physical therapy and medical management. The
patient to follow up with Cardiology , PCP and Urology. Continue
wound care dressing changes b.i.d.

207. Cardiac enzymes neg x2 EKG: LBBB , unchanged from 10/4 , not
present on 8/28
Hospital Course:
CV: Based on exam and labs , the patient was felt to be in mild CHF
on admission. She was Rule out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes
x3. Trans-thoracic Echo was done which showed EF of 50-55% with
hypokinesis of anterior and antero-septal wall. Tissue dopplers
suggested diastolic dysfunction , no valvular abnormalities except
trace TR. The patient was started on an ACEI for better BP control ,
no betablocker given h/o asthma. On statin , increased dose to
simvastatin 80. TSH negative. The patient responded well to Lasix IV
diuresis and felt that her breathing was back to baseline after two
days of diuresis.
Pulm: The patient has a history of asthma and OSA; she was continued
on nebs , MDI , O2. Recieved 1 dose of steroids in ED , but these were
not continued since her presentation was more consistent with CHF.
The patient needs CPAP at night , but does not take this at home
since she lost her CPAP machine.
Renal: The patient has a hx of CRI ( 1.5-2.1 ) due to diabetes , her
creatinine was stable between 1.7-1.9 during her admission with
diuresis and the addition of the ACE inhibitor.
HEME: The patient was anemic with a Hct of about 28 on admission. Iron
studies sent which showed Fe of 23 and TIBC of 367 ( transferrin sat
approx 6% ) This is consistent with Fe deficient anemia. The patient's
Hct subsequently dropped to 24.5 with slightly guaiac pos stool and she
was transfused 2u PRBC with resulting Hct 29.9. The patient has a
family hx of colon cancer and she recently missed colonoscopy in July .
Should reschedule as an outpatient to start w/u for Fe def
anemia and guaiac pos stools.
Endo: The patietn has a hx of poorly controlled DM2 in the past with
HgbA1c as high as 12 , HbA1c was repeated and found to be 7.2%.
Diabetes management service was consulted and recommended continuation
of Lantus at 70u QAM with adjustment in Humalog sliding scale. The
patietn should be scheduled for follow up with diabetes clinic as
an outpatient. The patient has significant neuropathic pain in her
feet due to diabetic neuropathy , has been unable to obtain neurontin
from tion hospital , pain currently managed on a PRN basis with occ
oxycodone at night.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You should take all of your medications as directed by your doctors.
It is very important to visit your doctors for follow up to make sure
that your diabetes , blood pressure , and heart failure are under
control. If you have additional trouble breathing or chest pain or any
other emergency , do not hesitate to return to the emergency room.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Follow up with diabetes management service
2. Follow up for colonoscopy to w/u Fe deficient anemia

ATTENDING: PAWELEK , BENTON FREDERIC MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease , CHF , EF of 15% status
post AVR , history of NSTEMI initially presenting to outside
hospital on 8/19/06 with chief complaint of shortness of breath ,
found to be volume overloaded with a clinical exam and laboratory
findings consistent with heart failure. The patient was found to
have a BNP of 747 as well as a troponin I of 0.43. A repeat echo
at that time revealed an EF of 15% , down from a previous EF of 25
to 35% with a functional aortic valve , moderate-to-severe mitral
insufficiency. A persantine MIBI demonstrated left ventricular
enlargement and three-vessel disease with ischemia in the mid
distal LAD and left circ territory as well as a fixed inferior
wall defect consistent with a right coronary artery infarct. The
patient was diuresed , started on Carvedilol and improved.
Troponins trended down. The patient continued to have frequent
runs of ectopy and SVT. The patient was placed on a heparin drip
and transferred to the Acbroadl Hospital for
catheterization and possible percutaneous intervention. On
admission , the patient reported to be feeling much better , denied
shortness of breath or chest pain. The patient reports
progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past several months ,
inability to lay flat , positive orthopnea and PND , reports
ability to climb two flights of stairs , also reports occasional
palpitations. No fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , constipation ,
diarrhea , bright red blood per rectum or pedal edema. The
patient reports poor compliance with diabetes management , denies
dietary indiscretion , reports medical compliance.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease status
post CABG in 1994 , coronary artery disease , CHF , cardiomyopathy ,
non-ST-wave MI , status post aortic valve replacement with St.
Jude's valve , hyperlipidemia , diabetes , anxiety.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include aspirin 81 , lisinopril 20 ,
Plavix 75 , verapamil 240 sustained release , gemfibrozil 600
b.i.d. , nystatin 500 b.i.d. , Paxil 20 daily , glipizide 10 daily ,
Coumadin 4 prior to admission to outside hospital , Carvedilol
6.25 daily , heparin drip and spironolactone.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient currently uses tobacco. No alcohol
use. The patient is retired , lives with wife in Lin Con , teaches
graduate courses.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient denies a family history of coronary
artery disease , however , there is hypertension and
cerebrovascular disease in his family.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile ,
heart rate 58 , BP 124/60 , respiratory rate of 20 , saturating 98%
on 2 L. The patient was in no acute distress , lying flat ,
speaking in full sentences. Mucous membranes moist , oropharynx
clear. JVP 12 with bibasilar crackles , left greater than right
and expiratory wheeze with long , pronounced expiratory phase.
Heart , S1 , S2 , prosthetic S2. No murmurs , gallops or rubs
appreciated. Abdomen soft , nontender and nondistended with
positive bowel sounds. Extremities are without edema. DP
intact. Feet are cool but well perfused. Skin warm , dry and
intact , no rashes. The patient is alert and oriented x3.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs notable for creatinine of 1 , hematocrit of
39.5 , platelets of 113 , cholesterol 157 , triglycerides 76 , HDL
32 , LDL 110 , hemoglobin A1c 6.3 , TSH 1.9. EKG , sinus rhythm ,
left bundle branch block with multiple PVCs , a widened QRS of
duration of 190 milliseconds. Chest x-ray , cardiomegaly
consistent with mild interstitial edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 64-year-old male with a
history of coronary artery disease status post CABG and NSTEMI ,
CHF with a known EF of 15% , status post aortic valve replacement ,
presenting through an outside hospital with CHF exacerbation
likely secondary to ischemia.
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: No evidence of ongoing ischemia on admission.
Elevated troponin at outside hospital trended down possibly
secondary to NSTEMI prior to admission versus demand. The
patient was continued on aspirin , Plavix , beta-blocker and ACE
inhibitor , which were titrated to effect. The patient was
started on a statin and continued on Niaspan , left heart cath
revealed occluded graft and 2+ aortic insufficiency with 100% LAD
stenosis , 70% diagonal 1 , 90% circumflex , 45% RCA and 100%
effused LIMA graft to circumflex and a 100% effused SVG graft to
LAD. The patient is now status post stenting the OM V1 and LAD.
The patient has remained asymptomatic and shortness of breath has
improved.
Pump: EF 15% on repeat echo with severe MR. The patient was
continued on spironolactone. The patient continued to be
diuresed initially and is now euvolemic. He will need a repeat
echo in three months to evaluate his ejection fraction and
determine the utility of an AICD placement.
Rhythm: We held verapamil secondary to double AV nodal blockade.
However , with the patient's history of widened QRS and multiple
PVCs and SVT , the patient will follow up with EP to assess the
utility of AICD.
2. Respiratory: The patient has no acute issues. Shortness of
breath has improved. Continues to complain of residual shortness
of breath while lying flat on his left side.
3. Renal: Creatinine has been stable at baseline. We will
closely follow status post chat. The patient was pretreated with
bicarbonate and Mucomyst. Creatinine remained stable.
4. GI: LFTs are mildly increased likely secondary to right
heart failure.
5. Heme: The patient's hematocrit was 39 on admission. It
trended down status post cath likely secondary to blood loss
given the long case and hemodilution; however , hematocrit fell to
38 concerning for retroperitoneal bleed. Despite patient
remaining hemodynamically stable and groin without evidence of
hematoma , the patient underwent a CT scan , which was negative.
His hematocrit was stabilized. He was not transfused , as he was
asymptomatic and recently revascularized. The patient was noted
to be guaiac positive without evidence of gross bleeding , thus
will need outpatient follow-up and colonoscopy. The patient
continues his heparin-bridged Coumadin with a goal of INR 2 to 3.
In addition , the patient suffers from long-term
thrombocytopenia. His platelet count was 113 on admission.
Review of records revealed thrombocytopenia on previous admission
to Norpid Memorial Hospital as well as on presentation to outside hospital prior
to heparinization , thus low suspicion for HIT. The patient's
platelet level remained stable. He should consider outpatient
evaluation by Hematology.
6. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes on oral
hypoglycemics , which were discontinued on admission. The patient
was controlled with regular insulin and placed back on his oral
hypoglycemics prior to discontinuing. A1c was within normal
limits.
7. ID: No acute issues.
8. Psych: History of anxiety , on Paxil and Ativan.
9. FEN: The patient was maintained on a cardiac diet.
10. Prophylaxis: The patient was encouraged to stop smoking.
He was maintained on a nicotine patch during his hospital stay ,
which he tolerated well. He will be discharged with a
prescription for the nicotine patch as well.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is to follow up with PCP and
Cardiology as well as EP. Patient encouraged to check his daily
weights and report a weight increase of more than 2 pounds daily
or 3 pounds a week to his PCP. The patient will also follow up
with INR checks as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE APPOINTMENTS: With his PCP , Dr. Qin , telephone
358-190-7457 , on 10/26/06 at 1:45 , Cardiology with Dr.
Mccoyle at 063-315-1331 on 6/2/06 at 3:15 and with
Electrophysiology , Dr. Kunich on 2/6/06 at 10:20. The patient
should arrange to have his INR drawn on 5/29/06 and follow-up
INRs to be drawn every seven days. INRs will be followed by his
PCP.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 p.o. daily.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Dear Mr. Rumpf , it was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in
the hospital. As you know , you had a heart attack because your
previous stent was occluded. The interventional cardiologist restented
this vessel in the catheterization lab. Please , it is crucial that you
continue taking your medications as instructed , especially ASPIRIN and
PLAVIX. Please take these medications every day until instructed
otherwise by your doctors. Please weigh yourself daily and keep
records of your weight. If you experience worsening shortness of breath
with exertion or at rest , have chest pain , dizziness , fainting , or
swelling , please call your doctor right away or go to the emergency room.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. ) Titrate Coumadin to goal INR 2-3.
2. ) Pt likely needs CPAP machine at home ( failed sleep study )
3. ) Titrate ACEi ( was previously on ARB ) as tolerated , BB ( now on Toprol
XL 200 , instead of atenolol 25 )
4. ) Likely needs re-eval of LV fxn in 6-8 meeks , AICD/PPM , consider
aldosterone antagonist.

Discharge Date: 7/20/2004
ATTENDING: ELVIS CULBERSON M.D.
DATE OF DISCHARGE: To be determined.
SERVICE: Heart Failure.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Referred by primary care physician for
increased dyspnea on exertion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 63-year-old male with COPD , CABG ,
ischemic cardiomyopathy , hypertension , CRI , CAD , atrial
fibrillation , distant history of DVT , morbid obesity , presents
with three weeks of increased dyspnea on exertion despite an
increase in his Lasix dose from 80 mg b.i.d. to 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d. He has also had progressive fatigue and somnolence. He
denies PND , orthopnea , chest pain , recently ( one week ago ). He
had productive cough and was started on amoxicillin with some
initial improvement in his energy , but has had a continuous
decline since then. He can do his activities of daily living ,
but he gets shortness of breath when he is wheeling around in his
wheelchair. He went to his primary care physician , Dr. Emil Hattaway who felt that he was volume overloaded and noticed a
desaturation to 81% on room air and admitted him to the Heart
Failure Service for diuresis and optimization.

1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. Morbid obesity.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline 1.6 to 1.9 ).
4. Gynecomastia.

6. Coronary artery disease.
7. Diabetes 2.
8. Venous stasis ulcer.
9. COPD.
10. Two-vessel CABG in 1995.
11. Echo in 2003 showing EF of 25% to 30%.

19. Echocardiogram 4/23/04 showed EF 25% to 30% , akinesis of
the inferior wall , right ventricular function was moderately
reduced , trace aortic insufficiency , mild mitral regurgitation ,
mild tricuspid regurgitation , PASP of 36 plus right atrial
pressure.
20. Hemoglobin A1c on 11/29/04 was 5.6.
ALLERGIES: Linezolid.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lasix 180 mg p.o. b.i.d. ( increased from 120 mg b.i.d. on
4/13/04 ).
2. Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. started on 11/9/04.

7. Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q. day.
The following medications have been stopped recently:
1. ACE inhibitor ( for hyperkalemia ).
2. Zocor.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 96.7 , pulse 95 , blood pressure
140/66 , respirations 20 , saturation 83% on room air up to 90% on
2 liters. The patient was in no apparent distress at rest , but
had mild shortness of breath with repositioning. His JVP was 13
to 14 cm. He had crackles bilaterally , one-third of the way up
his lungs. Heart was regular rate and rhythm , 2/7 left upper
sternal border murmur. Abdomen: Obese , nontender , nondistended ,
normoactive bowel sounds. He had a left below the knee
amputation , which was warm and clean. Right leg was fully
intact , but there is severe crusting of the skin of the leg from
the knee down , very swollen right foot with skin intact and no
palpable pulses.
LABORATORIES: Sodium 139 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 101 ,
bicarbonate 30 , BUN 71 , creatinine 1.7 , glucose 125. BNP was
473 , digoxin 0.8 , albumin 3.7. White blood cell count 6.2 ,
hematocrit 39.8 , platelets 122 , 000 , INR 3.0 , PTT 68.9. Chest
x-ray showed small bilateral effusions and enlarged cardiac
silhouette. EKG left bundle-branch block with no peaked T waves ,
normal sinus rhythm , T-wave inversion in I , L , V5 , V6 ( which
represent repolarization abnormality because they are asymmetric ,
consistent with LVH although it does not meet formal LVH
criteria ).
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: The patient had no clear evidence of ischemia , but
given his symptoms , the troponin was checked and that was
negative.
b. Pump: The patient was felt to be volume overloaded. His
admission weight was 130 kg. He was started on IV Lasix for
diuresis and began to diurese well putting out approximately 2 to
3 liters negative per day. He had a right heart catheterization
which showed right atrial pressure 16 , pulmonary artery pressure
of 66/26 with a mean of 42 , mean wedge pressure of 25 suggesting
high left-sided and right-sided filling pressures. Cardiac
output was 7.83 , cardiac index was 3.09 , SVR was 695 , PVR was
174. Therefore , the patient was felt to still be volume
overloaded and was diuresed further. At the time of this
dictation , his weight has dropped to 118 kg from 130 on
admission.
From the perspective of blood pressure , he was started on
hydralazine and Isordil to reduce his afterload and these were
titrated up with the goal systolic blood pressure of less than
120.
c. Rhythm: The patient had atrial fibrillation and he was kept
on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 to 3 except when he was being
prepped for his right heart cath. He is now being restarted on
Coumadin following the cath with the goal INR of 2 to 3.
2. Pulmonary: The patient seemed to have several possible
causes for his shortness of breath including volume overload and
his underlying COPD and body habitus. An arterial blood gas was
done with 2 liters nasal cannula on 10/11/04 and this showed pH
of 7.28 , CO2 of 76 , oxygen of 67 , and bicarbonate of 37. This is
on 2 liters nasal cannula giving an A-a gradient of 16. Compared
to his prior ABG in January 2003 , which showed pH 7.43 , carbon
dioxide of 52 , and oxygen of 60 with a bicarbonate of 37. This
suggested that the patient was hypoventilating. Therefore , he
was started on BiPAP overnight and he said that his sense of
comfort of breathing improved following BiPAP. At this point , he
will be sent home on home BiPAP.
3. Chest x-ray showed small- to moderate-sized bilateral
effusions , which were confirmed on a chest CT. However , because
the patient was still volume overloaded and seemed to be
improving with diuresis , a pleural tap was not attempted.
4. Dermatological: The patient had severe skin thickening from
his lymphedema. Dermatology was consulted for proper care of his
legs. They were initially concerned that there could have been a
superimposed cellulitis and the patient was initially started on
levofloxacin; however , there do not appear to be significant
clinical evidence of cellulitis and therefore , the levofloxacin
was discontinued after two days. Dermatology made specific
recommendations for care specifically , one-quarter strength
Dakin's soaks b.i.d. moist-to-dry on the legs followed by
betamethasone cream and Lac-Hydrin cream mixture twice a day.
There is also an indurated plaque on the right bridge of the
patient's nose for which Dermatology performed a shave biopsy for
concern of a basal cell carcinoma versus a squamous cell
carcinoma. This showed endophytic squamous proliferation with
atypia although the basal layer was not fully represented. This
was potentially the most superficially portion of a squamous cell
carcinoma and deeper sampling was required for more definitive
diagnosis. Deeper sampling has not yet occurred at this point.
5. Urology: The patient was noted to have a blood-tinged urine
output into his Foley. Initially , this was dark red; however ,
this lightened significantly. There are also some clots evident.
The Foley was removed and the patient was able to urinate on his
own; however , his urine is still tinged with blood although it
appears to have lightened up. Further followup will be required
likely with Urology as an outpatient.
6. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus , type 2 , which
is well controlled after his recent weight loss. He was
maintained on glipizide and lispro sliding scale.
7. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency secondary
to his diabetes mellitus. We avoided contrast dye. The
patient's creatinine has not increased during the diuresis
process going from 1.7 on admission to 1.7 on 1/23/04.
The discharge medications and instructions will be dictated as an
addendum at the time of discharge.

Discharge Date: 6/9/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year old male with
mitral regurgitation and a history of
congestive heart failure , who presents for cardiac catheterization
and a coronary artery bypass graft. He has a history of severe
coronary artery disease and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
He is status post multiple previous myocardial infarctions and
presents with dyspnea on exertion over the last several months.
However , he denies any frank chest pain. The patient's cardiac
workup revealed four vessel coronary artery disease and severe
mitral regurgitation. He is preoperatively admitted to the
cardiology service for surgical planning for coronary artery bypass
grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus;
osteomyelitis; anemia; right 5th and left
third toe amputation; peripheral vascular disease; anemia; chronic
renal insufficiency; status post laminectomy; tobacco and alcohol
use.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin , Lasix , Accupril , Digoxin , Isordil , and
aspirin.
ALLERGIES: To fish , which causes swelling.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Spanish-speaking male in no acute
distress. NECK: No carotid bruits. LUNGS:
Crackles at the bases bilaterally. HEART: II/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the axilla , with a displaced of PMI. ABDOMEN: Soft ,
non-tender. EXTREMITIES: The femoral pulses are palpable
bilaterally , however , there were no palpable distal pulses. There
was no evidence of any significant varicosities. The left shin is
significant for two small eschars with a minimal rim of erythema.
His lower extremity is consistent with chronic vascular disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for surgical planning.
Previous echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of 25-30% , a dilated left atrial size , 4+ MR , and moderate
TR. There was also severe hypokinesis of the inferior posterior
wall of left ventricle. Cardiac catheterization performed on
2/8 showed four vessel disease. Follow-up ABI studies were
stable with the right at 0.68 and the left at 1.61. Carotid
noninvasive studies showed no significant carotid disease to
warrant surgical evaluation.
On 7/23 , the patient was taken to the operating room , where
quadruple coronary artery bypass graft was performed , as well as a
mitral valve repair with a #26 posterior Cosgrove annuloplasty
band. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported
to the cardiac surgery ICU.
Postoperatively , the patient's course was significant for acute and
chronic renal insufficiency in the setting of a low ejection
fraction , congestive heart failure , and volume overload. The
patient was weaned off of epinephrine and diuresed accordingly. He
was subsequently transferred to the stepdown unit after several
days in the ICU. He continued to progress well with the additional
diuresis. His chest tubes and wires were removed without
difficulty. Radiographs showed improvement in bilateral pulmonary
edema.
On the day of discharge , the patient was stable with stable vital
signs. He was afebrile , with no significant leukocytosis. His
renal function had returned to his baseline of around 2.0.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 2 ) captopril

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. HYPERTENSION.
2. LEFT FRONTAL LOBE MENINGIOMA.
3. DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Testani is a 90+ year-old woman with
a history of hypertension , prior
atrial fibrillation , who presented to the Ie Health on
2/14/01 with shortness of breath and some chest pain lasting
several hours at home. She was brought in by her great
granddaughter and found to have ST segment elevations inferiorly on
an electrocardiogram concerning for inferior myocardial infarction.
At that point she was transferred to Hobert Center
for emergent catheterization. In the emergency room she was
treated with Lasix , Lopressor , morphine , nitropaste , aspirin and
heparin and then sent for cardiac catheterization. Cardiac
catheterization showed a right dominant system with no left main
disease , mid left anterior descending coronary artery 80 percent
lesion , a proximal left circumflex left anterior descending
coronary artery lesion and a proximal 100 percent posterior
descending coronary artery stenosis. The posterior descending
coronary artery was intervened upon and stented to a residual
stenosis of 0 percent. The patient tolerated the procedure well
without any complications and was then transferred to the intensive
care unit for further monitoring. On admission to the coronary
care unit the patient had no complaints , including no shortness of
breath , and no chest pain. She was noted to have a right groin
hematoma for which pressure was held.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , atrial fibrillation , history
of pulmonary edema , left frontal lobe
meningioma as documented by MRI of the brain in February of 2000.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix dose unknown , atenolol 50 mg p.o.
q day , Zestril 10 mg per day , Isordil 10
mg t.i.d. and meclizine p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98 , heart rate 75 , blood pressure
140/70 , respiratory rate 16 , 94 percent on 2 liters
of oxygen. GENERAL: Awake , alert and oriented in no acute
distress. Oropharynx is clear. Crackles present bilaterally
throughout both lung fields. CARDIAC: Regular , rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2. II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border. No radiation to the neck. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender and
nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No edema. 2
plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Neurologic
status intact. Nonfocal exam.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: White blood cell count 13.6 ,
hematocrit 39 , platelets 222 , 000.
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 100 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 37 ,
creatinine 2.0 , glucose 192. PT was 11 , PTT 23 , INR 0.88. CK
number one is 216 with no MB fraction done prior to transfer. CK
number two post cardiac catheterization 2577 , MB 310 , troponin
3.49.
Electrocardiogram prior to transfer showed normal sinus rhythm at
the time pre-catheterization. Rate of 75. Two millimeter ST
segment elevation in leads II , III and F.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: The patient was transferred
to the coronary care unit after cardiac
catheterization and right coronary artery stent for further
management. She ruled in for a myocardial infarction. Her peak CK
was 2577 with a MB fraction of 310. Troponin on admission was
3.49. She was placed on aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , Zestril and
simvastatin. Two days after this initial catheterization on
10/10/01 , the patient was transferred to the floor and subsequently
had an episode of flash pulmonary edema and was thought to be to
diastolic dysfunction. This occurred in the context of her having
a systolic blood pressure of 200. She was then transferred back to
the coronary care unit where she had intermittent complaints of
chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed pseudo normalization of the T
waves laterally. Her CKs continued to trend down however due to
the concern of further ischemia she was placed on heparin and
brought back to the catheterization laboratory on 6/27/01 for
stenting of the left circumflex lesion. Since the second stent she
continued to do well from a cardiovascular standpoint. Her CKs
continued to trend down. An echocardiogram was done which showed
an ejection fraction of 45 percent , inferior posterior akinesis ,
moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
She was managed with aspirin , Plavix with plans to keep her on this
for one month , Zocor and Lopressor. Due to a rising creatinine
after the second catheterization her Zestril has been stopped and
she has been started on hydralazine until her creatinine
normalizes.
2. Renal: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.6 which
increased to 4.0 after her second catheterization. The etiology is
deemed to be contrast induced nephropathy. Her creatinine is now
improving down to 3.2 at the time of discharge. This should be
followed and her Zestril restarted at 10 mg per day and the
hydralazine stopped when the creatinine normalizes to below 2.0.
Electrolytes were stable throughout the admission.
3. Pulmonary: No active issues currently. She did have an
episode of flash pulmonary edema in the setting of high blood
pressure found to be due to diastolic dysfunction. The goal is to
control the patient's blood pressure to avoid these episodes.
There is no need for diuresis.
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with a hematocrit
of 39 but did drop to 27 slowly during the course of the admission.
She did have guaiac positive stools while on heparin. She was
transfused a total of two units to keep her hematocrit above 30 and
for the five days prior to discharge , her hematocrit was stable at
34. The patient consumes a low fat low cholesterol diet and is on
Prilosec 20 mg q day.
5. Psychiatry/neurologic: The patient was noted to sun down at
night with episodes of confusion and agitation. A psychiatry
consult was obtained and felt that the patient's behavior was
consistent with dementia and recommended starting Zyprexa. The
patient was placed on standing Zyprexa 5 mg at night and continued
to improve on this medication. She had no episodes of agitation
after being transferred to the floor. In addition she has a
history of left frontal lobe mass which is consistent with a
meningioma. This has been noted on CT and MRI scans done in February
of 2000. Neurosurgery consult was obtained and felt that surgery
would not be a good option for this patient , in addition they did
not feel that the mass was responsible for any mental status
changes.
6. Infectious disease: The patient has a history of a positive
RPR which has not been treated previously. She is now being
treated for syphilis with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units
times three injections. She has one injection pending which is due
on 3/5/01. In addition she has had a negative lumbar puncture
for neurologic syphilis.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is to be discharged to the
Chora Medical Center with
eventual plans to return to home.
She will also follow up with a new primary care provider , Dr. Ernesto Fouch at the Crestsant Health on 2/2/01.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: The patient was brought to the ESIH ED by her daughter with the chief
complaint of left leg pain. They were concerned about the healing of her
left fibula/tibia fracture.
---
HPI: The patient is a 72-year-old woman with CAD s/p CABG , chronic kidney
disease ( declined HD ) , congestive heart failure ( EF 30% ) , HTN , and
hypocalcemia. She has also been hospitalized numerous times in the past
two years for CHF exacerbations in the setting of NSTEMI. She has
preferred not to take any of her prescribed medications despite repeated
discussions about benefits of decreased mortality , prevention of
re-hospitalization , and symptom management. In April 2006 she sustained a
displaced LLE tib/fib fx after banging her leg into her bed while driving
her motorized scooter in her apartment. She has been treated by Dr.
Russel Frausto at PCHCOC . She initally refused surgical repair and was
casted , but subsequent films have shown valgus angulation and poor
healing. She declined surgery ( and was a high-risk surgical candidate
given her multiple comorbidities. On 11/27/06 the cast was removed by
Dr. Malhotra and has been in a walking boot since then. She states that
she has pain of the left midleg that she has treated with Tylenol and
that has limited her ability to try and bear weight.
Her daughter brings her in today because of concern for her mother's left
leg. The air cast was taken off yesterday and since then , she has had
worsening pain of the leg. She has been unable to move it or bear any
wait. There is a valgus deformity. They are requesting orthopedic
evaluation. She denies new numbness/tingling or weakness in the
extremities. She also notes multiple chronic problems including
decreased appetite with 40lb weight loss over the past 4-6 months ,
lethargy , apathy. ""I just want to be able to walk again and do the
things I used to like doing."" ( Going to the horse track , walking
outside. ) She states that she is NOT depressed but sleeps most of the
day.
The family has discussed these symptoms with her PCP. In the past ,
symptoms have been attributed to her worsening renal failure , cardiac
status in this patient who refuses to take any medications. She has
wanted to remain home yet has had documented discussions with PCP about
the benefits of placement to a nursing home for longterm care. Family is
currently looking into assisted living facilities. She also has
requested DNR/DNI status in the past.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease: s/p IMI and 2-V-CABG , July of 2001
( LIMA>LAD , SVG>PDA. ) Her anginal equivalents are N/V but not CP. She is
followed by a cardiologist , Dr. Trent Cannizzo at CICGH . She is uninterested
in pursuing any additional cardiac evaluation.
2. CHF with EF 26% ( 5/25 ). Mod-Severe MR. Several exacerbations over
past yr. in setting of NSTEMI ( 3/22 )
3. Hypertension.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2 , non-insulin requiring. Her most recent
hemoglobin A1c was less than 6% without medications. Her diabetic
complications include peripheral neuropathy and chronic kidney disease.
5. Chronic kidney disease 2/2 DM with a baseline creatinine of 3.5 to 4.
She has no interest in hemodialysis.
6. Hypocalcemia secondary to chronic kidney disease and profound vitamin
D deficiency with an associated myopathy and bone pain. She also has
severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
7. History of colon cancer status post a partial colectomy. The patient
has requested no follow-up for this problem.
8. Osteoarthritis status post a left total hip replacement for aseptic
necrosis. Since that time she has a leg length discrepancy and uses
crutches to ambulate until a recent tib/fib fx which has left her
WC-dependent.
9. Chronic anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease. She does have a
history of prior upper GI bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease.
ROS: No recent fevers/chills or night sweats. No shortness of breath ,
cough or chest pain. No abdominal pain. No constipation/diarrhea. No

IMPRESSION:
72F with multiple chronic medical problems s/p recent tib/fib fx
( non-surg mgmt ) admitted for evaluation of her fracture. She was admitted
to medicine for ""longterm placement."" Yet upon interview of the family
they intend for Ms. Pall to go home after this hospital stay. From
there , she will transition to assisted living. Over the last few months ,
she has declined to take any medications or treatment for her chronic
kidney disease or cardiac disease. This has led to progressive renal
disease , electrolyte abnormalities and myopathy. The family brings her
in with concerns regarding her left leg. While they do want to
transition to assisted living , they do not intend to place her directly
from DUOMC to RH or Rehab. They hope she will go home after this hospital
stay and continue with VNA/services.
ORTHO: Tib/fib fracture. Non-surgically managed. Followed by Dr.
Alirez Seen by Orthopedic service who discussed the 2 options:
casting with patellar tendon bearing cast or surgery. As before ,
patient declined surgery ( this decision has been supported by her PCP and
cardiologist as she is a high risk surgical candidate. ) There were no
casting technicians in-house this weekend. Therefore she will followup in
the Orthopedics clinic on Wednesday , as instructed by the ortho resident
on call.
.
CKD. Monitor renal function and lytes. Patient agreed to take vitamin
supplements such as nephrocaps. Phosphate was wnl despite not taking
phoslo at home.
.
CHRONIC HYPOCALCEMIA: Elevated PTH. Patient agreed to take calcitriol
.
ENDOCRINE: recent elevated TSH. T3/T4 pending at discharge.
-H/o Diabetes yet with progressive renal failure , does not require
insulin and with nl A1C
.
CV: EF 30% , multiple prior admits for CHF. Was in NOT in CHF on admission
and had stable O2 saturation at 98-100% on RA with no recent increase in
DOE.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
50 y.o. female with multiple medical problems
including obesity , IDDM , hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , sleep
apnea presents with worsening SOB x 1 month. She reports that
following a pneumonia about 1 year ago , she has
felt progressively short of breath. Over the
past month , her symptoms have become
incerasingly bothersome , interfering with her ability to
talk , walk , and exert herself. She denies
fever/chills/ chest pain/palpitations/PND , but does report
4 pillow orthopnea ( increased from 2 ) , nocturia
( at baseline ). She presented to her pulmonologist
5/6 who felt that her lung disease was
most consistent with restrictive lung disease due
to her obesity. She presented to her allergist
3 days PTA , who felt that she had a CXR
consistent with CHF and increased her lasix to 100 qdx 3 days
with some effect. She presented to her PCP on the
day of admission and was noted to have a decreased
O2 sat; she was sent to TSGH for further evaluation.
Of note , she has many allergies , including latex , was a 1.5 ppd smoker
x 30 years , quit one and a half years ago , and has recently started a
weight loss program , losing 22 pounds in 3
months. In the ED , she was given aspirin ,
solumedrol , nebs , and ativan with some relief. Pertinent exam
findings: markedly obese , labored breathing at times , but speaking
in full sentences. No JVD. Lungs: rare wheezes , few crackles at
bases , no signs of consolidation. CV: distant , RRR , S1 S2
Abd: soft , obese Ext: trace edema , WWP , no calf tenderness. A/P: Pulm:
Likely restrictive component due to obesity as well as deconditioning ,
likely anxiety component as well as possible pulmonary hypertension due
to sleep apnea , smoking hx. Subjectively , acute exacerbation of sx may
also be related to heat/humidity. Nebs for comfort , but primary goal
is for increased cardiopulmonary fitness , weight loss. CPAP for sleep
apnea as well. Outpatient pulmonary rehab. O2 sat 97% on RA with
ambulation prior to d/c. Symptoms improved. CV: continue cardiac
meds , lipid lowering agents. ID: no infectious etiology/sx Endo: Type 2
DM- continue current regimen. Sent HgbA1C.
Pt was discharged home in stable condition she will follow up with her
primary care doctor.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you have chest pain , increasing shortness of breath , headache ,
fever , or other worrisome symptoms , please call your doctor or return

fibrillation , which has since resolved and C. diff colitis at
rehab. She was discharged from the Wooda Community Hospital to rehabilitation
facility on 10/4/06 where she developed C. diff colitis and
diarrhea. She was started on p.o. Flagyl , which she continued
until the first week of August . Prior to that , she had been
treated with Cipro for UTI while at the Luke's Ca Health . She was
improving clinically until about three days prior to admission
when she noted persistent diarrhea. She began to feel lethargic
with subjective fevers and chills. She also noticed chest pain
that was substernal and intermittent with left arm pain. Pain
was described as diffuse , constant and 3/10 in intensity. Pain
was nonexertional. She also noted persistently loose stools
without blood. On arrival to the emergency room , she had a fever
to 102 Fahrenheit. No tenderness in her chest to suggest
mediastinitis. She was seen by Thoracic Surgery in the emergency
room and cleared.
ED COURSE: Echo was obtained. Chest x-ray , chest CT and blood
and urine cultures were obtained. She was given vancomycin 1 gm
plus Flagyl 500 x1 , given IV fluids 500 mL normal saline and
potassium.

ASSESSMENT: This is a 71-year-old woman with a history of
hypertension , CHF , status post a mitral valve/tricuspid valve
repair in mid September , complicated by postoperative C. diff
colitis and UTI who presented with persistent diarrhea and three
days of fever , chills and chest pain. The patient's fatigue was
most likely related to dehydration secondary to persistent C.
diff related diarrhea. Over the course of her hospitalization ,
it became clear that she experienced chest pain during her
intermittent episodes of ventricular ectopy. Now that her NSVT
is under better control , she is chest pain-free.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient was continued on aspirin , beta-blocker ,
statin and gemfibrozil. She had negative cardiac enzymes x3 and
ruled out by biomarkers.
Pump: The patient was initially dry on exam. She was rehydrated
with normal saline. The patient developed shortness of breath on
hospital day #4 , most likely secondary to overhydration. She was
gently diuresed with IV Lasix. Electrolytes were repleted twice
daily. She was then transitioned to 40 of Lasix p.o. daily and
finally per cardiology recommendation 20. She will be discharged
to home on 20 b.i.d. p.o.
Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. On
hospital day #2 , she developed atrial fibrillation with
hypotension most likely secondary to Diltiazem , which was
subsequently held. The patient's blood pressure improved
dramatically with gentle IV hydration on hospital day #2. Her
Diltiazem will be discontinued. The patient is on Coumadin now
with therapeutic INR on discharge at 2.6. Per cardiology , her
beta-blocker was increased to 75 q.i.d. and then she was
transitioned to Toprol 300 daily; however , she had persistent
nocturnal NSVT , which caused her some chest pain and was quite
frightening to her. Per cardiology , she was loaded on amiodarone
400 t.i.d. , which will be continued for 5 days post-discharge and
then the patient will be transitioned to 400 amiodarone daily.
At the same time , her Toprol will be decreased to 100 mg daily ,
her discharge dose. Echocardiogram was ordered on the day of
discharge per cardiology. See LMR for formal report.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient with recent UTI and C. diff
colitis in the setting of recent hospitalization antibiotic use
presented with diarrhea and elevated white count and fever.
Continued on Flagyl p.o. and vancomycin p.o. for Flagyl failure.
She had one C. diff positive stool. Stool became C. diff
negative as of 9/2/06. Her diarrhea rapidly slowed on dual
therapy. She will be discharged with seven more days of
antibiotics to complete.
3. Endocrine: The patient on home dose Synthroid. TSH
initially low , however , rechecked and found to be within normal
limits. Continue home dose of Synthroid.
4. Heme: The patient's hematocrit was stable throughout her
hospitalization. Continue Niferex at home dose , continue
Coumadin at 2.5 mg nightly.
5. Pulmonary: The patient had a low pretest probability for PE.
Given her allergy to IV contrast , she was not a candidate for
PECT; however , a V/Q scan was obtained on 1/19/06. The result
was low probability for pulmonary embolism. Her respiratory exam
improved greatly on b.i.d. Lasix.
6. Renal. The patient's creatinine was stable throughout her
hospitalization.
7. Prophylaxis: Coumadin with therapeutic INR plus proton pump
inhibitor.
8. FEN: The patient was initially started on a clear liquid
diet. On hospital day #3 , she began to eat solid foods and
tolerated well.
9. Code status: The patient was a full code throughout her
hospitalization.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Continue home medications as indicated.
2. Continue vancomycin and Flagyl for 7 more days.
3. VNA instructed to draw INR on Thursday , 2 days post-discharge

4. Stop Diltiazem and metoprolol.
5. Start Toprol-XL 100 mg daily.
6. Continue amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. until Sunday , 5/29/06 and
then switch to 400 mg daily.
