fibrillation , and chronic kidney disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 86-year-old woman
with a history of diabetes , chronic kidney disease , congestive
heart failure with ejection fraction of 45% to 50% who presents
from clinic with a chief complaint of fatigue and weakness for
one week. She had had worsening right groin and hip pain , status
post a total hip replacement approximately 13 years ago which had
been worsening for two weeks , and she has also recently completed
a course of Levaquin for urinary tract infection. She presented
to Dr. Parrent office complaining of fatigue and weakness for one
week. She has had some abdominal pain in a band-like
distribution around her right side. She was found to have a
hematocrit of 21 down from 30 eight days ago and was sent to the
emergency department for transfusion and workup of her anemia.

News Irv In She denies tobacco use and drinks alcohol rarely.
ALLERGIES: Codeine and Benadryl.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs were temperature
96.7 , heart rate 60 , blood pressure 153/74 , respirations 22 , and
SaO2 95% on room air. The patient is a frail elderly woman in no
acute distress. She has poor dentition. JVP is difficult to
assess secondary to tricuspid regurgitation. Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam showed bradycardia
with heart rate in the 50s that was irregular , S1 plus S2 with
3/6 systolic murmur heard throughout with mechanical sounding S2.
Abdomen was mildly tender to palpation in the mid epigastrium
with no rebound or guarding. Extremities showed venous stasis
changes in her lower extremities bilaterally. Feet were cool
with diminished DP and PT pulses. On neurological exam , she was
alert and oriented x3 and cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.
STUDIES: EKG showed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular
response with heart rate of 53 , widened QRS , a Q wave in aVL , and
U waves in the lateral leads.
Chest x-ray showed improved pleural effusions and pulmonary edema , stable marked
cardiomegaly.
X-ray of the right hip showed ,
1. Status post right total hip arthroplasty with stable
periprosthetic lucency and cortical remodeling.
2. Severe left hip osteoarthritis.
3. Diffuse atherosclerosis.
EGD on 10/24/06 showed hiatal hernia , fundic polyps with
pathology showing hypoplastic and inflammatory lesions; mild
antral erosions with pathology demonstrating mild regeneration
that was nonspecific and no H. pylori; and duodenitis with
pathology showing normal mucosa but no active bleeding or signs
of recent bleeding.
Capsule endoscopy on 7/5/06 showed a healing gastric ulcer likely in the
antrum , small bowel lymphangiectasia and angioectasia in the distal small
bowel.
Colonoscopy on 9/12/06 demonstrated cecal diverticulum , approximately 3-mm
ascending sessile polyp and several small sessile polyps in the rectosigmoid.
PROCEDURE: Right basilic vein transposition on 9/12/06 by Dr.
Jacinto Goonez .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. GI bleed: In the emergency department , the patient's vital
signs were temperature 95.4 , heart rate 62 , respirations 16 ,
blood pressure 127/66 with SaO2 98% on room air. She was found
to have black guaiac positive stool and GI was consulted. She
was started on IV Nexium 20 mg b.i.d. and was given vitamin K 10
mg subcutaneously and two units of FFP , and she was transfused
three units of packed red blood cells with Lasix 120 mg IV for
each bag. Of note , the patient had a colonoscopy in
Wa on 8/26/05 , which showed bleeding rectal ulcers with
biopsies consistent with ischemic colitis. An EGD on 10/24/06
showed a hiatal hernia; fundic polyps ( path:
hypoplastic/inflammatory ); mild antral erosions ( path: mild
regeneration , nonspecific; no H. pylori ); duodenitis ( path:
normal mucosa ) , but no active bleeding or signs of recent
bleeding. Capsule endoscopy on 7/5/06 showed healing gastric
ulcer likely in the antrum , small bowel lymphangiectasia and
angioectasia in the distal small bowel , which were considered the
likely sources of bleeding. Colonoscopy was performed on
9/12/06 to search for angioectasias for which intervention would
be possible , but demonstrated only a cecal diverticulum and
approximately 3 mm ascending sessile polyp and several small
sessile polyps in the rectosigmoid. The patient was started on
Aranesp but had a 5-point hematocrit drop from 32 to 27 on
9/12/06 for which she required another two units of blood along
with Lasix. The patient's hematocrit remained stable at
approximately 30 to 32 and she will be restarted on
anticoagulation on Thursday , 12/10/06 , one week after her AV
fistula surgery.
2. Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is being
considered for a possible hemodialysis in the future. She was
continued on her Caltrate plus D , multivitamin , and iron
supplementation and she was started on Aranesp 25 mcg weekly and
was given sevelamer 400 mg q.a.c. for elevated phosphate levels.
Vein mapping study was performed on 7/25/06 , and a right basilic
vein transposition was performed on 9/12/06 by Dr. Landrie . The
patient had postoperative right hand coolness , numbness , and
weakness ( always with dopplerable radial pulse ) from steal
versus neurapraxia , which was improved by the time of discharge.
She will follow up with Dr. Chanthasene as an outpatient. The
patient's creatinine was 3.3 on admission , improved to 2.0 by
9/12/06 , which was the day of her surgery and increased again to
3.2 on 1/10/06 .  She was given IV Lasix boluses as she had
evidence of volume overload with over eight-pound weight gain
during her hospitalization , and creatinine improved to 2.7 by the
day of discharge.
3. Cardiovascular:
Pump: The patient's ejection fraction is 45% to 50% and she was
given 120 mg of IV Lasix for each unit of packed red blood cells
she received , along with 120 mg p.o. daily with IV boluses of 180
mg as needed for volume overload as judged by an increase in her
weight. Antihypertensive medications were originally held for
her GI bleed and they were restarted on 10/24/06 with systolic
blood pressures remaining in the 120s to 130s.
Rhythm: The patient has atrial fibrillation with slow
ventricular response with heart rates as low as the upper 30s.
Occasionally , her heart rate appeared regular and was thought to
be junctional escape rhythm. She was asymptomatic throughout her
hospitalization. She was discussed with her cardiologist , Dr.
Fritz , who will consider a pacemaker as an outpatient.
4. Endocrine: She is euthyroid with TSH of 2.422. For her
diabetes , she received nightly Lantus with aspart q.a.c. and
sliding scale when eating and Regular insulin sliding scale q.6h.
when n.p.o. Fingersticks were elevated to 300s early during this
admission but improved to the 100s upon increasing her insulin
dose.
5. Musculoskeletal: The patient is status post right total hip
replacement approximately 13 years ago and complained of right
hip pain upon admission. An x-ray showed stable arthroplasty and
the pain was improved by the morning of 10/24/06 .  She will
follow with physiatrist , Dr. Allan Kofoed .
COMPLICATIONS: Right hand weakness , numbness , and coolness
status post AV fistula surgery , possibly secondary to steal or
neurapraxia , significantly improved by the time of discharge.
CONSULTANTS: Dr. Garfield Kiehne from vascular surgery , Dr. Ambrose Moldrem from gastroenterology.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: Stable vital signs. Lungs
with bibasilar crackles. 3/6 systolic murmur heard throughout
plus a mechanical S2. Abdomen benign. Lower extremities with
chronic venous stasis changes. Right upper extremity AV fistula
with +thrill. Decreased right radial pulse with warm
hand distally , and 4/5 strength in hand grip of the right hand.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Norvasc 5 mg daily , Caltrate plus D one
tablet p.o. b.i.d. , Aranesp 25 mcg subcu weekly , Lovenox 50 mg

ATTENDING: DROEGMILLER , STANTON MD
DATE OF DISCHARGE: Not known at the time of this interim
dictation.
SERVICE: List Medical Center .
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Postpartum cardiomyopathy status post
mitral valve repair , status post tricuspid valve repair , status
post ICD/pacer placement , asthma , and anemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 33-year-old female with a
history of postpartum cardiomyopathy ( EF 15% to 20% ) , status post
pacer/ICD placement , status post mitral valve
replacement/tricuspid valve replacement , who presents with
abdominal pain , decreased appetite , nausea , vomiting , and
occasional chest pain. The patient has had multiple recent
admissions to H/seases Medical Center .  In October 2005 , the
patient presented with chest pain and was found to be in
decompensated heart failure. She ruled out for myocardial
infarction. She was diuresed with torsemide. A MIBI prior to
this admission in October 2005 had showed no evidence of
ischemia. The patient was more recently readmitted in July
2005. During this admission , she underwent mitral valve repair
and tricuspid valve repair given severe mitral regurgitation and
tricuspid regurgitation. She had a catheterization on 6/12/05 ,
which showed normal coronary arteries , no equalization of
diastolic pressures , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19 ,
and 4+ mitral regurgitation. A TTE during this admission showed
an EF of 15% to 20% with wall motion abnormalities. She had mild
right ventricular enlargement and decreased right ventricular
function. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 16 plus right
atrial pressures. She was also found to have a 1.5-cm
pericardial effusion. On this admission , the patient's primary
complaints involve decreased appetite , nausea , vomiting , and
abdominal pain. The patient reports frequent vomiting after
meals. The vomitus is nonbloody and nonbilious. The patient
denies diarrhea , in fact , she has been constipated. Her last
bowel movement was on the day of admission , but she did not have
a bowel movement four to five days prior to this time. She
denies fever or chills. She denies dysuria or hematuria. She
denies melena or bright red blood per rectum. She reports
intermittent shortness of breath , which she believes to be her
baseline. She denies weight gain , orthopnea , or PND. The
patient reports occasional tightness in her left chest , which
occurs a few times each week. There are no associated ischemic
symptoms. The pain is nonexertional and it is pleuritic. In the
emergency room , the patient was afebrile with a pulse of 97 and a
blood pressure of 98/58. Her cardiac enzymes were negative x1.
A PE protocol CT was negative for pulmonary embolus. The patient
was noted on this CAT scan to have a pericardial effusion. The
patient was seen by the Cardiology Service who performed a
bedside echocardiogram , which showed effusion , but no evidence of
right atrial or right ventricular collapse.

shows trace leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 4 to 8 white
blood cells , no red blood cells , and 1+ bacteria. Urine hCG is
negative. Chest x-ray shows stable cardiomegaly without
pulmonary edema or infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia. The patient reported chest pain on admission. The
chest pain was atypical for ischemia and that it was
nonexertional. It was pleuritic and it had no associated
ischemic symptoms. In addition , the patient had normal
coronaries on a recent catheterization in 3/22 as well as a
nonischemic MIBI in October 2005. The patient's enzymes were
negative on this admission. The patient was continued on her
beta-blocker.
b. Pump. The patient has a postpartum cardiomyopathy with an
ejection fraction of 15% to 20%. She also has a pericardial
effusion on this admission. On admission , there was no evidence
of tamponade by exam or by echocardiogram. The patient had a
repeat TTE on 10/18/05 , which showed pericardial effusion , which
was slightly larger than that seen in July 2005. There was
respirophasic variation , but no collapse. The patient's urine
output decreased on 8/26/05 and she underwent right heart
catheterization , which showed extremely elevated right and left
filling pressures ( pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the 40s ,
right atrial pressure 27 ). The patient was initially placed on a
Lasix drip. She was also started on IV dobutamine to maintain
her blood pressure and for perfusion while being diuresed. After
a few days on this regimen , the patient had a repeat right heart
catheterization , which showed improved , but elevated left and
right filling pressures. A Swan catheter was left in place for
closer monitoring of the patient's hemodynamics and to allow for
tailored therapy. At the time of this dictation , the patient
will be tried on various inotropes including dopamine and
dobutamine with close monitoring of her hemodynamics. The
purpose of this is to assess the effect of these inotropes on her
hemodynamics , so there would be a time when she requires inotrope
therapy at home. The patient was also maintained on digoxin.
Her Aldactone was changed to eplerenone given the possibility
that Aldactone could be contributing to the patient's GI
complaints. At the time of this dictation , there is a plan in
place to try to add hydralazine/Isordil to the patient's regimen
for afterload reduction if her blood pressure can tolerate this.
In the past , the patient had suffered severe hypotension when
such medications have been added.
c. Rhythm. The patient is status post pacer/ICD placement. She
was monitored on telemetry. Her telemetry will be followed
closely for any evidence of ectopy while on dobutamine or
dopamine.
2. Pulmonary: The patient has a history of chronic cough. Past
chest CTs have shown ground-glass opacities most likely due to
edema , which have resolved on more recent imaging. Pulmonary
function test in July 2005 showed an FEV1 of 2.06 , FEV1/FVC of
102 , total lung capacity of 3.09 , and a DLCO corrected of 54%
predicted. The patient was continued on Advair and was given
Atrovent p.r.n. As mentioned previously , a PECT on admission was
negative.
3. Renal/FEN: The patient has hypokalemia in the setting of
diuresis. Her electrolytes were monitored b.i.d. and repleted as
needed. The patient's creatinine remained stable less than 1
throughout her admission. The patient was maintained on a
low-salt , food-restricted diet.
4. GI: The patient presented with a number of GI complaints
including abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , and anorexia. It is
not clear what the cause of these symptoms is. The patient had
normal liver function tests. She had a KUB , which showed no
obstruction. Her urine culture showed no evidence of urinary
tract infection. It is possible that abdominal pain was due to
constipation or as a side effect of Aldactone or even to a low
flow state in the setting decompensated heart failure. The
patient was continued on a bowel regimen and a proton pump
inhibitor. At the time of this dictation , the patient's
abdominal complaints have resolved.
5. Heme: The patient has a history of iron-deficiency anemia.
On admission , her hematocrit was 30 with a MCV of 79.4. The
patient takes iron supplementation at home. This was held
temporarily in the setting of constipation. The patient also
takes Coumadin for a low ejection fraction. This is also placed
on hold in the setting of various procedures including her right
heart catheterizations and PA catheter placement. It should be
noted that the patient has a history of HIT positive.
6. ID: On 9/15/05 , the patient had a temperature of 100. This
was status post placement of a PA catheter. There was concern
for a line infection. Blood cultures were drawn and the patient
was started on vancomycin. At the time of this dictation , blood
cultures showed no growths to date , but should continue to be
followed.
7. Psych: The patient has a history of depression. She
appeared dysphoric on admission , but denied any suicidality.
Both Psychiatry and Social Work were contacted who followed the
patient during this admission and who have followed the patient
on previous admission. The Psychiatry Service had recommended
Remeron for sleep , which the patient was given with good effect.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient was given Pneumoboots early on in
her admission and then was out of bed several times each day.
She was also given a proton pump inhibitor.
9. Code: The patient is full code.
The events that occur after the time of this dictation , the
disposition , discharge condition , followup , and discharge
medications will be dictated in an addendum to this discharge
summary.

Discharge Date: 10/8/2005
ATTENDING: SATOW , DARNELL M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
This is a 64-year-old woman with a history of nonischemic
cardiomyopathy who was admitted with increasing volume overload.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Schmittou was doing well until approximately two weeks prior to
admission when in the setting of dietary indiscretion she noticed
some shortness of breath and weight gain. She states that she
started to increase her Demadex from 200 mg in the morning and
150 mg in the afternoon to 200 mg b.i.d. without significant
diuresis. She has continued to participate in cardiac rehab
without significant difficulty. Her weight was stable at 174.
She did , however , noticed worsening of intermittent dyspnea on
exertion and orthopnea , although she denied PND or pedal edema.
She denied abdominal symptoms of bloating , no satiety , nausea or
vomiting. She denied chest pain , discomfort , palpitations ,
lightheadedness or syncope. She does have occasional chest
burning. She also noted burning in her feet bilaterally which
has previously been attributed to neuropathy. On the day of
admission , she presented to the Outpatient Clinic to have an
echocardiogram and repeat exercise stress test with oxygen
uptake. She exercised for 4 minutes and 32 seconds achieving a
peak heart of 90 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 100/64
and stopping secondary to fatigue. Her peak oxygen uptake was
only 9 mL per minute despite on RER of 1.09. This is essentially
unchanged from a prior exercise stress test one year ago.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Includes nonischemic cardiomyopathy diagnosed in 1996 , with clean
coronary catheterization at that point. She has history of
hypertension , hypertriglyceridemia , and left bundle-branch block
status post ICD and pacemaker placement. Her pacer is
biventricular. She also has a history of urine bleeding. She
had a recent hysteroscopy and laparoscopy which were
unremarkable.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Included lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily , Toprol 75 mg p.o. daily ,
Demadex 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Aldactone 25 mg daily , KCl 10 mEq
daily , allopurinol 100 mg daily , colchicine 0.6 mg daily and
Evista 60 mg daily.
ALLERGIES:
Penicillin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She was afebrile with heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 104/66.
Her weight was 174. Her JVP was at approximately 16 cm of water
with hepatojugular reflux to the angle of the jaw. Her carotid
upstrokes were brisk without bruits. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Her cardiac exam was regular in rate
and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and audible S3. She has 2/6
systolic murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation. Her
abdominal exam was benign except for liver edge that is palpable
approximately two fingerbreadths below the costal margin. Her
extremities were noncyanotic with no clubbing or edema. They
were lukewarm.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Unremarkable.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
LABORATORY DATA:
Her most recent labs had showed a sodium of 138 , a potassium 3.9 ,
a BUN of 67 , a creatinine of 1.9 and glucose of 123. Her LFTs
were all normal except for mildly elevated bilirubin of 1.3. Her
last lipids showed a total cholesterol of 128 with 191
triglycerides and HDL of 31 and an LDL of 59. Her last CBC was
unremarkable. Her EKG shows an a-sensed V-paced rhythm at the
rate of 72 beats per minute.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
Cardiovascular: Ms. Helger is a 64-year-old female with
nonischemic cardiomyopathy and class II-III symptoms who
presented with worsening volume overload in the setting of
dietary indiscretion. Given that she is already maximized on her
outpatient diuretic dose and somewhat worsening of her renal
function , she was admitted for further diuresis with IV
torsemide. She was also admitted for the beginning of her
transplant evaluation for potential cardiac transplant. She was
initially started on IV torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. with a goal of 1
to 2 liters of diuresis per day. She was continued on digoxin
and switched over from lisinopril and captopril. Her medications
were adjusted to optimize her diuresis and avoid hypotensive
episodes. She did go for a right heart cath on this
hospitalization that showed increased RA pressure of 14 and a
wedge pressure of 35-44 with V wave. Her cardiac index was
calculated at 1.38. Her SVR was calculated at 1600. Her mixed
venous O2 sat was between 52% and 60% when the readings were
repeated. Given that she appeared quite well and Lasix drip was
started to accelerate her diuresis. She was maintained on
tailored therapy including nitrates for afterload reduction and
the up titration of her captopril. She did have impressive
diuresis on Lasix drip. Her transplant workup at this time
included PFTs that showed an FVC of 2.64 , which his 86% predicted
an FEV1 of 1.82 , which is 75% predicted and FEV1 to FVC ratio of
69%. Her corrected DLCO was 14.6 , which was 56% of predicted.
She did have as well a carotid duplex ultrasound showing no
significant stenosis in either carotid artery. Her ankle
brachial indices were greater than 1 in both lower extremities
and her leg pulse volume recording was all entirely normal. Her
24-hour urine collection showed a value of 920 mg over the total
volume which was in the normal range. She did continued to
respond reasonable well to the diuresis with the exception of a
few episodes of asymptomatic hypotension. Her creatinine did
begin to bump marginally indicating that she had likely been
slightly over diuresed. She subsequently stabilized and was
discharged on a stable dose of diuretics including torsemide 100
mg p.o. b.i.d.
Her other discharge medications include captopril 25 mg t.i.d. ,
Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Claritin , Coumadin 5 mg daily , thiamine and
multivitamin , colchicine , magnesium , Evista , Aldactone 25 mg
daily , digoxin 0.125 mg daily and allopurinol 100 mg daily ,
Toprol-XL 25 mg daily.
She was discharged with plan for regular follow up with her
outpatient cardiologist.

are no splinter hemorrhages. No Osler nodes or red spots. There
is 1+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities. There
are 1+ distal pulses in the upper and lower extremities
bilaterally. Neuro: The patient is alert and oriented x3 and
exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: At the time of admission , sodium 144 , potassium
4.5 , chloride 106 , bicarb 30 , BUN 41 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 83 ,
anion gap is 8. White blood cell count of 8.1 , hematocrit 31.7 ,
platelets 332 , 000. There are 71% neutrophils , 14% lymphocytes
and 12% monocytes. Calcium is 8.7. Urinalysis shows trace
blood , 3+ leukocyte esterase. 40-50 white blood cells , 1-5 red
blood cells , trace bacteria.
STUDIES AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION.
1. Chest x-ray shows status post midline sternotomy and CABG.
There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette , which is
unchanged from prior x-rays. Right lung is clear. There is a
small left posterior pleural effusion , which has been reduced in
size compared to his previous x-ray dated 8/29/07 .
2. EKG revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm with atrial
fibrillation with a rate of 44. There is left axis deviation , a
right bundle-branch block and Q waves in II , III and aVF , which
is unchanged from an EKG in 5/3 .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is an 82-year-old gentleman
with a history of multiple medical problems most significantly
including recent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis , CAD
status post CABG , CHF , atrial fibrillation with a slow
ventricular response who was transferred from rehabilitation with
a fever , positive urinalysis and positive blood cultures with
concerns for endocarditis given his recent AVR. The patient was
initially started on ceftazidime and vancomycin empirically.
Blood cultures were obtained and the patient grew out
two out of two bottles of Gemella morbillorum from his blood.
Urinary cultures were also obtained , which revealed 10 , 000
colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cultures were also taken
from the suprapubic catheter wound site and revealed rare MRSA ,
few coag-negative staph and rare enterococci. Once blood
cultures for Gemella morbillorum returned , the patient's
antibiotics were changed to gentamicin and ceftriaxone on
7/17/07 .  Ceftazidime was discontinued as was vancomycin. The
patient remained afebrile while inhouse and did not exhibit any
significant leukocytosis or stigmata of endocarditis.
Surveillance cultures obtained after starting antibiotics have
remained negative to date. A TTE was obtained and was negative
for any valvular vegetation. However , given the patient's high
risk for endocarditis , a TEE was obtained , which was also
negative for any ring abscess or valvular vegetation. The
patient , however , will be treated for endocarditis given his high
risk.
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient had no chest pain , chest tenderness or
chest discomfort. He does have a history CAD status post CABG
and was continued on his full strength aspirin. He was also
continued on statin.
Pump: The patient was volume overloaded at the time of admission
and was treated with 60 mg of IV Lasix. Following this , he
appeared euvolemic and Lasix was held for several days and then
gradually became volume overload and was again given 60 mg of IV
Lasix and then restarted on his home dose of 80 mg p.o. QAM. At the
time of discharge , the patient is slightly volume overloaded , but
diuresing well with 80 mg daily. The patient's Losartan was held
in the setting of his chronic renal insufficiency and initiation
of gentamicin therapy. At the time of discharge , his weight is
96.6 kg. His I/O goal at time of d/c is 500cc negative daily. He should
continue daily weights. Of note , the patient's dry weight is
approximately 93 kg. Pt's lasix should be titrated as he reaches his dry weight.
Rhythm: The patient is bradycardic at baseline down into the
mid-to-low 30s , is asymptomatic and has in the past refused
permanent pacemaker placement. All nodal agents should be
avoided for this reason. The patient did have several runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia upto 14 beats. Electrolytes
were checked twice daily to keep magnesium above 2 and potassium
above 4. However , no other medical management was initiated
given his bradycardia.
2. Infectious Disease: As noted above , there was high suspicion
for endocarditis in this with a recent AVR. He was found to have
Gemella morbillorum in his blood and was started as noted above
empirically on vancomycin and ceftazidime and then changed to
gentamicin and ceftriaxone on 7/17/07 once gram-positive cocci
were speciated. The patient was initially treated for
pseudomonal UTI with five days of ceftazidime , but given that
only 10000 CFUs grew out , it was decided that ceftazidime
could be discontinued and that there would be some response to
ceftriaxone plus gentamicin. A PICC line was placed on 7/17/07
for continued IV antibiotics and the patient should continue a
full six-week course of ceftriaxone and at least a two-week
course of gentamicin for presumed endocarditis despite
both negative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram
given his high risk for endocarditis.
3. GI: The patient was continued on his home dose of Protonix
and all his stools were guaiaced and were negative in house. The
patient should be continued on p.r.n. Colace.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus. His Lantus was titrated up to 36 units
nightly and at that level required no sliding scale insulin.
5. Renal: The patient was found to have a slightly elevated
creatinine above his baseline on admission ( 1.9 with a baseline
of 1.1 to 1.3 ). This elevated creatinine was thought to likely
be due to his CHF and poor forward flow. As the patient was
diuresed , his creatinine decreased to 1.4 at the time of
discharge. Given his creatinine elevation , however , his Losartan
was held and this should be held while the patient is on gentamicin.
6. GU: The patient has a history of BPH and at the time of
admission had a suprapubic catheter that was inserted in 4/10
due to difficulty to pass Foley catheter. The catheter was
clamped and post-void residuals were checked and were only 50 mL
and the patient was urinating without difficulty with tube clamped ,
so Urology was consulted and suprapubic catheter was pulled
without difficulty. Suprapubic wound was dressed with a sterile
dry dressing to be changed daily.
7. Fluids , Electrolytes and Nutrition: The patient has a
current input and output goal of 0.5 L negative daily. He is on a 2L fluid
restriction.
Electrolytes. The patient has been having twice daily
electrolyte checks to keep his magnesium above 2 and his
potassium above 4 given his arrhythmias while he is on 80 mg of
Lasix daily. This should be continued.
Nutrition. The patient was placed on a cardiac , 2-gm sodium
diet and a 2 L fluid restriction.
8. Pulmonary: The patient is to continue on Flovent and
albuterol.
9. Heme: The patient was continued on Niferex twice daily for
iron deficiency anemia. He was also found to have a very mild
eosinophilia , which should be followed.
10. Derm: The patient was found to have a skin tear on his
right hand. This is being treated with neomycin ointment and
sterile dry dressing changes daily.
11. Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin
5000 units three times daily and continued on his PPI.
CODE: The patient is full code.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
IDENTIFICATION: 73F w/ a h/o recent anterior STEMI ( 9/22 ) c/b apical
aneurysm , apical thrombus , and ischemic cardiomyopathy w/ most recent EF
35% admitted from home w/ increasing DOE and fatigue.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mrs. Chepiga is a lovely 73yo woman who presented in 9/22 with 3 days of
epigastric and chest pain and was found to have a STEMI. She
subsequently underwent DES to ramus and LAD. Flow through the LAD was
only TIMI 2 by the end of the procedure. Course was complicated by
post-MI pericarditis , apical wall thinning , and mural LV thrombus.
She was discharged initially to short-term rehab , then subsequently went
home w/ weekly f/u w/ cardiac rehab. While at short term rehab , she was
treated w/ doses of lasix as high as 120 mg IV. Following discharge from
rehab , she was ultimately taken off of diuresis b/c of ""dizzy spells"" she
was experiencing while on lasix.
She did well off lasix until 2 weeks ago , when she was noted to have
decreased exercise tolerance and increasing fatigue at cardiac rehab.
She says that she is usually able to ambulate for 15 minutes on the
treadmill; she hasn't been able to do this for the past 2 weeks b/c of
dyspnea and fatigue. This has been accompanied by new-onset PND
( occurring as frequently as 3-5 times/night ) , 5 pound weight gain , and
increasing abdominal girth. She does acknowledge dietary indiscretion
this past week ( had a can of mushroom soup 4 days ago ). No orthopnea.
Mrs. Bloxsom cardiac rehab. contacted Dr. Takach ( her primary
cardiologist ) a few days ago to inform her about Mrs. Losey DOE and
increasing fatigue. Starting 2 days ago , she was placed on lasix 40 mg.
Since then , she has taken a total of 5 doses. She came to urgent care
this PM and was noted to desat. to 85% w/ ambulation in the setting of
fluid overload. She was subsequently admitted.

CXR: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
7/5/2006 ECHO: Mildly dilated left ventricle ( systolic diameter: 3.57
cm and diastolic diameter: 5.89 cm ). Overall left ventricular function
moderately reduced w/ EF 35%. Anteroseptal wall is akinetic from
midventricular level to apex , and hypokinetic at the base. Focal basal

11/26 ETT: Duration 3'20'' and stopped d/t fatigue. Attained 4.7 METS.
Maximum heart rate 125 at 85% of predicted. Maximal blood pressure
130/70. ECG ST changes of accentuation of baseline ST , T wave
abnormalities. Apparently , low HR recovery. Imaging w/ large myocardial
scar in the proximal LAD territory. Small and mild myocardial ischemia
in the OM territory ( small defect involving the basal inferolateral

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: 73F w/ a h/o recent anterior STEMI ( 9/22 ) c/b
apical aneurysm , apical thrombus , and ischemic cardiomyopathy w/ most
recent EF 35% admitted from home w/ increasing DOE and new-onset PND.
Appears to be fluid overloaded , improved w/ diuresis over 3 day
hospitalization.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. CARDS PUMP: Volume overloaded w/ ischemic CMP implicated.
Initially received IV diuresis w/ lasix 80 mg IV bid and was ~2.5 liters
negative. SBP down to 80 following overdiuresis on 6/14 held diuresis
on 10/7 .  Resumed oral regimen w/ lasix 40 mg po qdaily on 10/5 .
Discharged on lasix 20 mg po qdaily. Continued spironolactone 25 mg po
qdaily. Increased lisinopril to 30 mg po qdaily to optimize heart
failure regimen at admission; changed to 15 mg po qdaily on 10/7 after
SBP dropped to 10/7 .  Also , she had apparently been taking this
inconsistently as well.
2. CARDS ISCHEMIA: No active issues. Recent ETT w/ small reversible
defect involving the basal inferolateral wall. Continued ASA , plavix ,
lipitor.
3. CARDS RHYTHM: W/ known ischemic cardiac disease and EF~35% ( down
to 31% on post-stress by MIBI ) , inclined for AICD placement ( MADIT ).
Discussed w/ EP and she will see Dr. Pippens as an outpatient. Repeat Echo
4/3/06 w/ estimated EF 40%. Defer decision on EP eval to primary
cardiologist Dr. Dewolf
4. PULM: Hypoxia in the setting of volume overload. Weaned O2 w/
adequate diuresis.
5. HEME: 9/22 course c/b LV thrombus , has been on
anticoagulation. Repeat echo. w/o thrombus , however apex quite akinetic
and contrast study with stagnant flow concerning for high risk of thrombus
recurrence. Therefore , warfarin was continued in addition to ASA and
plavix. The decision to continue these three medications is deferred to
pt's primary cardiologist , Dr. Navejas . Pt has INR drawn locally but is
managed by the CDMC coumadin clinic and will f/u with them.
6. ENDO: Initially on regimen of lantus , lispro , and sliding scale.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Sick sinus syndrome.
4. Delirium.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. Diabetes , newly diagnosed.
2. Chronic anticoagulation.
3. Hypertension.
4. History of GI bleed.
5. Prior CVA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Stonerock is an 89-year-old male with a history of multiple
medication problems , including hypertension , atrial fibrillation ,
sick sinus syndrome , history of colon cancer and prostate cancer ,
status post embolic stroke in 3/22 , and history of congestive
heart failure with an EF of 40-50% , who presented to the
emergency room complaining of two days of increased lethargy. At
that time , he denied cough , chest pain , shortness of breath , PND
or orthopnea. In the emergency room , the patient was found to
have a heart rate in the 120s with a new left bundle-branch
block. Carotid massage was attempted and the patient blocked to
15:1 due to sick sinus syndrome. An echocardiogram was done in
the emergency room , which revealed an EF of 25%. It was felt
that the patient was in acute congestive heart failure
exacerbation secondary to the atrial fibrillation with RVR. It
was deemed at that time too dangerous to pharmacologically
convert the patient. He was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit for placement of a transvenous pacer.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Arthritis.
3. Atrial fibrillation , on anticoagulation.
4. History of prostate cancer , status post prostatectomy.
5. History of colon cancer , status post partial colectomy.
6. History of dementia.
7. History of GI bleed.
8. Status post MRSA wound infection.
9. Status post embolic CVA in 6/17/05 .
10. Sick sinus syndrome.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Colace.
2. Coumadin.

ALLERGIES:
No known allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient denies cigarette , drug or alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY:
The patient had a father who died at the age of 63 of a heart
attack. There is a family history of colon cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Afebrile , pulse irregular , 125; blood pressure 140/100. Pulse
oximetry was 97% on 2 liters. General: This is an elderly male
in no acute distress. Neck: Supple , no lymphadenopathy , no
thyroid enlargement , JVP at 18 cm with flutter waves. Carotids
are 2+ bilaterally. Pulmonary: Bibasilar rales.
Cardiovascular: Irregular rate and rhythm , tachycardic , S1 , S2
normal. No murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen: Soft , nontender
and nondistended. Bowel sounds are present. Extremities: Warm
bilaterally , 2+ pitting lower extremity edema. No clubbing or
cyanosis.
LABORATORY STUDIES UPON ADMISSION:
Notable for mild elevation of the white blood cell count of 11.0 ,
hematocrit of 40.6 , and platelets of 218 , 000. Electrolytes were
within normal limits. The creatinine was mildly elevated at 1.3.
BNP was markedly elevated at 7931. Coagulation showed an INR of
2.9. LFTs were within normal limits. Cardiac enzymes showed a
CK of 129 , CK-MB of 5.9 , and an elevated troponin at 0.27. EKG:
Atrial flutter with RVR , rate in the 120s , and new left
bundle-branch block. Chest x-ray: Cardiomegaly and
cephalization , no acute infiltrate.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN UPON ADMISSION:
This is an 89-year-old male with a history of sick sinus
syndrome , atrial fibrillation , on Coumadin , as well as congestive
heart failure , who was admitted for atrial fibrillation/atrial
flutter with RVR , and decompensated congestive heart failure. At
the time of admission , the patient was felt to be at risk
secondary to his sick sinus syndrome and new left bundle-branch
block. He was felt to be at risk for asystole and symptomatic
bradycardia with any blocking agents. Therefore , transvenous
pacer was scheduled to be placed in the Cath Lab.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Rhythm: Shortly after admission , the patient had a temporary
ventricular pacer placed on 9/13/05 with a heart rate of less
than 50. After the procedure , the patient was admitted to the
CCU with atrial flutter with RVR and a rate in the 20s. The rate
was intermittently controlled with a combination of IV digoxin
and Lopressor. On 6/6/05 , a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker
was implanted with VVI at 50. Throughout the next two days , the
patient's heart rate continued to be difficult to control , but
improved with diltiazem. The patient was initiated on an
amiodarone load on 8/22/05 .  The following day , he converted to
normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. At that time , he continued to
be ventricularly paced , and the pacemaker was changed to DDD on
10/21/05 .  For the remainder of the hospitalization , the patient
remained in normal sinus rhythm and was dual-paced without any
recurrence of arrhythmias. He will be continued on his
amiodarone load , which was 2.9 g upon discharge and we continued
for a total load of 10 g.
b. Pump: Upon admission , an echocardiogram on 5/23/05 showed
an EF of 20-25% with regional wall motion abnormalities noted in
the intraventricular septum , which was akinetic as well as global
hyperkinesis of the left ventricle. On admission , the patient
had indications of heart failure , including increased JVP and
bilateral lower extremity edema , as well as pulmonary effusions.
The patient was diuresed effectively with low-dose IV Lasix. His
admission weight was 91 kg , and upon discharge , it was
approximately 87 kg. The patient was given intermittent Lasix 10
mg IV for diuresis to maintain a negative I&O of 500 mL. Upon
discharge , the patient may require continued diuresis with home
regimen of p.o. Lasix. In addition , the patient was noted to
have marked hypertension throughout his stay. Blood pressure was
occasionally difficulty to control , and at times , required IV
nitro drip. Systolic blood pressures were noted to as high as
180 and as low as 100 with IV nitro drip. The patient's blood
pressure was managed with calcium channel blocker , beta-blocker ,
as well as ACE inhibitor. Upon transfer to the cardiology floor
on 10/21/05 , the p.o. diltiazem was increased. Upon discharge ,
the patient will be continued on a home regimen of lisinopril 10
mg p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and diltiazem
extended release 360 mg p.o. daily. At the time of discharge ,
the patient's blood pressure was well controlled with systolic
blood pressures ranging from 110 to 120s.
c. Ischemia: Upon admission , the patient had cardiac enzyme
elevation with initially 0.27 , which elevated to a max of 1.27 on
10/23/05 .  Initially , the enzyme elevations were thought to be
secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of an elevated heart
rate and volume overload. However , the patient underwent a
cardiac catheterization on 2/25/05 which showed evidence of
coronary artery disease , two-vessel disease , specifically , there
was a LAD proximal 90% lesion as well as diffuse proximal-mid
standing 80% lesion , as well as RTLV-BR mid discrete 80% lesion
beyond the bifurcation of RPDA. On 2/25/05 , the patient had a
successful roto-ablation , angioplasty , and insertion of three
cipher DES to the LAD resulting in TIMI 2 flow. On 1/1/05 , the
patient returned to the cath lab , and at that time , he had a DES
placement at distal RCA. The patient denied a chest pain
throughout his stay. Upon discharge , he was able to ambulate
without significant dyspnea on exertion or chest discomfort.
2. Psychiatry: At the beginning of the hospital stay , the
patient was confused and somewhat agitated. His behavior was
controlled with Haldol as well as p.r.n. Ativan. The patient's
confusion and delirium improved significantly , and the Haldol and
Ativan were tapered off. Prior to discharge , he was reinitiated
on his home regimen of Zyprexa. The patient has a longstanding
history of dementia. Geriatrics consult followed in this case
and advised on titration of a Haldol.
3. Vascular: Following the cardiac catheterization , the patient
was noted to have a right femoral bruit. A vacular ultrasound
was obtained on 7/18/05 and did not show any evidence of an AV
fistula.
4. Heme: The patient is on chronic anticoagulation for atrial
fibrillation. Upon admission , his INR was 2.9 and became
elevated to a supratherapeutic level. Therefore , his Coumadin
was held. The patient will be reinitiated on Coumadin when his
INR is below 2. Goal INR will be between 2 and 3.
5. Endocrine: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and
was continued on his home dose of Synthroid 25 mcg p.o. daily.
Thyroid function tests were checked and were within normal
limits. In addition , the patient was noted to have mildly
elevated fasting blood glucoses during his admission. His blood
sugars ranged from 95 to 182. He was maintained on a regular
sliding scale insulin and required only minimal units of
supplemental insulin. A hemoglobin A1c was ordered , and the
results are still pending at this time.
6. GI: The patient was noted to have significant constipation
throughout his stay and was continued on an aggressive bowel
regimen , which included Colace , senna , lactulose , and Dulcolax.
The patient has a history of GI bleed. He was noted to have a
small amount of blood in the stools secondary to constipation ,
but this was resolved with additional bowel movements. His
hematocrit remained stable , with no signs of anemia. The patient
does have a history of colon cancer for which he underwent a
colectomy. He will be followed as an outpatient.
7. FEN: Due to the patient's heart failure , he was placed on a
2-liter fluid restriction as well as 2 g salt restriction. The
patient was continued on a low-cholesterol , low-salt diet. Due
to his mild sedation with Haldol , the patient was evaluated by
speech and swallow and initially placed on mechanical soft diet
with some honey-thick liquids. As his mental status improved
significantly , the patient was returned to a house diet ,
low-cholesterol , low-fat , with the previous salt and fluid
restrictions. The patient was continued on light scale
throughout his stay.
8. ID: The patient was noted to have a urinary tract infection
based on urinalysis upon admission. His culture remained
negative throughout his stay. He was initially given
ceftriaxone. Initially , he was started on Keflex following on
pacemaker placement for antibiotic coverage , which was
discontinued on 1/12/05 .  The patient remained afebrile , with no
signs of systemic infection throughout his stay.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on a PPI. His INR
remained subtherapeutic throughout his stay.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.

ADDENDUM
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes ,
hypertension , CAD status post MI in 2000 who presented with an ST
elevation MI to the Emergency Room on 8/23/06 .  He was brought
to Cath where he was found to have in-stent thrombosis in his LAD. The clot was
aspirated and bare-metal stent was placed in his LAD
and another stent was placed in his diag-2. He suffered multiple V-Tach
cardiac arrests requiring CPR and cardioversion. In the
Cath Lab , he was given bicarb , placed on the epi drip , given
Lasix and was intubated. He was thought to aspirate at the time
of intubation secondary to vomiting. A bedside echo revealed
global hypokinesis with an EF of 35%. He , at that time , was
placed on a balloon pump , dopamine 16 , amio 1 , propofol 1 , and
Integrilin and brought to the CCU. On the floor , his blood
pressures were difficult to control and his PA catheter readings
indicated a wedge pressure of 47. His MAPs were marginal and max dopamine , max
Levophed , epinephrine and dobutamine were required to maintain a minimal blood
pressure.
His family was aware of his prognosis and was there at the time
of his arrest at 3:30 in the morning. CPR was initiated , and
ACLS was performed until the family decided to terminate the ACLS. At that
time , there were no spontaneous breath sounds , no heart sounds , and nonreactive
pupils. The cause of death was thought to be cardiogenic shock
secondary to ST elevation MI. His time of death was 3:47 a.m. on 8/23/06 .

Hospital Course:
+CV: No evidence of acute coronary event ( ekg , enzymes unremarkable ). Due
to med noncompliance ( pt ran out med ) , pt was hypertensive with sbp >
200. Pt's home medications listed above were restarted and blood pressure
normalized to sbp 120-140's.
During hospitalization , CK's trended up ( peak 872 , at discharge 675 ) but
troponin stayed less than assay. Pt has long history of elevated CK's.
Suspect his elevation may be due to lipitor. Pt denied myalgias or chest
pain. Defer to pcp for consideration of switching to other statins that
may not cause elevation of CK. In interim , will pt will not be continued on
lipitor; we have also discharged pt on labetolol 800 mg BID as recommended
by his outpatient cardiologist at his most recent visit.
Pt also had episode of NSVT ( 12 beats ) during hospitalization. Echo
revealed concentric LVH with EF 45% , slightly decreased from prior; but
essentially unchanged from previous echo. EKG without changes as compared
with ekg 4/3 .  Discussed with cardiology service who felt that given EF and
history of LV dysfunction , no indication for pacemaker. Follow up arranged
with patient's cardiologist ( Dr. Rucki ) and pcp ( Dr. Bendit ).
+ID: ?C. diff. Pt reported several days worth of diarrhea daily. Given
h/o C. diff , started treating empirically. Pt was unable to provide stool
sample as he had no episodes of diarrhea during hospitalization. Given
h/o C. diff , will continue flagyl and lactobacillus as outpatient for 11
additional days.
+Renal: ESRD on HD. Pt dialyzed on admission with some improvement in BP.
+Endo: DM. Ct home regimen of lantus qam.

and not cooperative. Agitation responded well to trazodone and pt was
able to sleep overnight. Pt resides in group home with access to mental
health resources.

dehydration , polyarticular joint soreness and left hip pain. For
his hyperkalemia , the patient was treated with calcium ,
gluconate , insulin , Kayexalate and his potassium level returned
to normal levels by hospital day #2. For his acute renal
failure , the patient was hydrated gently with 60 cc of normal
saline. The renal service was consulted and assisted with
management. The patient was urinating. Renal ultrasound was
normal. Renal function returned to baseline and his creatinine
at discharge was 1.4. His baseline is 1.6. With correction of
his renal function , the patient regained strength. For his joint
symptoms , Rheumatology was consulted who performed arthrocentesis
of the left knee and diagnosed polyarticular gout. No treatment
was initiated in the setting of impaired renal function and a
concern for fluid retention. He has a followup appointment with
Rheumatology in September 2005. For his hip pain , his orthopedist ,
Dr. Schuchmann , evaluated him for possible future hip surgery.
Neurology was consulted regarding atrophy of thenar muscles and
elevated CPK. They did not feel a secure diagnosis could be made
and recommended following daily CPK , which trended down over the
course of hospitalization. Followup appointment in Neurology was
scheduled to discuss essential tremor and further investigate the
muscle wasting with nerve conduction studies and EMG if necessary
based on CPK levels. The patient had an echocardiogram on
hospital day #2 , which showed an ejection fraction of 40 to 45% ,
no pericardial effusion , and hypokinesis of the mid and distal
septum , mid and distal inferior wall and decreased global right
ventricular function. The patent foramen ovale was visualized.
At discharge , the patient was afebrile , hemodynamically stable ,
euvolemic , ambulating , and saturating on room air , and on a
stable medical regimen. He was followed by VNA at home starting
February , 2005 , for INR checks.
Followup appointments for Cardiology , Neurology , and Rheumatology
were put in place. The patient was asked to contact his primary
care physician to schedule a followup appointment.
On admission , the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically
stable.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
76 year old woman with CHF , moderate MR , PAF , HTN , and obesity who
presented with left upper arm pain since 3 pm the day of admission.
Denies any SOB , CP , N/V , diaphroresis. Took 5 baby aspirin at
home without relief of pain. Pain came on at rest. No history of
recent trauma. In ED , MSO4 relieved most of pain. Pain was noted to be
positional , increasing when arm is stretched down. Reports
increasing SOB over last several months , increased leg edema with 10
lb weight gain. No orthopnea or PND. PE: HR 58-61 , BP 141/81 98% RA.
PE: tenderness to palpation over L deltoid with pain with resistance to
abduction ( +supraspinatus involvement ). Full ROM in bilateral
shoulders. Chest: CTA bil. Neck: JVP 7 cm. ECG: 1st degree AVB , no
ischemic changes. CXR: no acute cardiopulmonary changes. Initial
enzymes flat. BNP 120
Hospital course.
The shoulder pain was felt to be secondary to supraspinatus
tendonitis/strain. The patient was advised to take a short course of
ibuprofen and was given shoulder exercises to do by physical therapy.
In addition , patient reports increased leg edema , SOB , and weight
gain. She ruled out for MI by enzymes and ECGs. By exam , much of the
changes in her legs appeared chronic. She did not appear to be in
respiratory CHF by exam or BNP. She does admit to dietary
indiscretions over the past few weeks. She was kept on her current
medications doses , including lasix 80 mg BID and instructed to keep a
daily weight log. A follow-up appointment was made for her with Dr.
Roginson on 6/3/03 .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Daily weights each am. Please record to show Dr. Ciminera .
2. Low salt , fluid-restricted diet
3. Ibuprofen 400 mg three to four times per day until you see Dr.
Pruzansky for shoulder pain. Please take with food.
4. Shoulder exercises as demonstrated by physical therapy.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:

ATTENDING: GOETZE , BURTON M.D.
DATE OF BIRTH: 3/23/1927 .
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Hypovolemia and fatigue.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , hypertension ,
hyperlipidemia , peptic ulcer disease , severe anxiety ,
cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction between 15% and 20% , and 2+
mitral regurgitation.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Weakness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old male with a
history of coronary artery disease status post silent MI and
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction between 15% and 20% , who
has a longstanding history of severe anxiety and presented with
fatigue and shortness of breath. On the day of admission , the
patient took an extra dose of Lasix because he thought that he
might be fluid overloade. In the emergency room , it was thought
that he appeared dry and he was admitted for volume
resuscitation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , silent MI in
1998 , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , peptic ulcer disease with GI
bleed , severe anxiety , cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction
previously reported at 20% in October 2005 , 2+ mitral
regurgitation , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix 20 mg to 40 mg daily , aspirin
325 daily , Lipitor 5 mg daily , Toprol XL 25 daily , Valium 5 mg
t.i.d. p.r.n. , Accupril 5 mg daily and Aleve p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa causes rash and ciprofloxacin causes
hallucinations.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is an Irish descendent. He lives
alone with many cats. Drinks occasional ethanol , no tobacco or
illicit drugs. He is retired.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Temperature 95.6 , heart rate 112 ,
blood pressure 153/90 with orthostasis , respiratory rate 18 , 97%
oxygen on room air. General: No acute distress , alert. Pupils
are equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation
bilaterally. Extraocular motor intact. His oropharynx is clear.
Dry mucous membranes. Neck: Supple , JVP flat. Lungs: Clear
to auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Tachycardic with occasional
premature heartbeats. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen:
Nondistended , soft and nontender. Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities: No edema , clubbing , or cyanosis. Neuro: The
patient was oriented. Cranial nerves III through XII intact.
Strength is 5/5 throughout. The sensation was intact throughout.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Upon admission , the patient appeared dry and
was resuscitated with one liter of IV fluids. The patient's
Lasix was held initially on admission. On hospital day #2 , he
was looking well. His weight was 151 pounds which was suspected
to be close to his dry weight which was reportedly 149 pounds.
By 8/18/05 , he was restarted on 20 mg of Lasix daily so that he would stay
euvolemic. He received intermittent IV Lasix ( 20mg ) throughout the remainder
of his hospitalization and his p.o. Lasix dose was settled on 40 mg p.o.
daily. His captopril was restarted on the 9/19/05 at 6.25 mg t.i.d. He
tolerated that dose and was switched to Accupril 2.5 mg b.i.d. He underwent an
echocardiogram on 11/9/05 which demonstrated possible vegetation
on the tricuspid valve verus a flail leaflet. This question of a
vegetation raised concern for possible endocarditis and blood
culture were sent. The patient's temperature had been low on
admission , since there was some concern that he could be
developing sepsis , however nothing grew from the blood cultures
throughout the remainder of his hospitalization. He was seen by
Cardiology , who did not think that this echo result required
further intervention and suspected that it represented a flail
tricuspid valve leaflet. The patient's troponin
One troponin level was elevated at 0.11 initially and then
another troponin was elevated on 10/27/05 in the setting ARF and
acute hepatitis. He recently had a negative stress echo at the
Laketon Medical Center , so no additional stress testing
was pursued during this admission. He was switched to Lopressor
25 t.i.d. and then switched back to Toprol XL. His statin was
discontinued during the admission because of LFT abnormalities
which will be discussed below. He was monitored on telemetry
which demonstrated frequent PVCs and some NSVT. This
should be readdressed in Cardiology Clinic. Cardiology decided to hold off on
placing an AICD and was to see him as an outpt.
2. GI/renal: On the morning of 10/27/05 , the patient developed new confusion
and delirium. He also developed an oxygen
requirement the night before. His labs on morning were notable
for a transaminitis in the thousands , acute renal failure with
hyperkalemia and acidemia with bicarbonate of 13 , and a new leukocytosis ( WBC 9
to 25 ). He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including coverage for
bartonella as he had many cats. He was empirically started on mucomyst and
acyclovir as per GI in case his LFT abnormalities were due to tylenol
toxicity or HSV. He was initially going to get a liver biopsy but this was
cancelled as his LFTs started to normalize. He had a RUQ with dopplers which
was negative. The etiology of his hepatitis , renal failure and leukocytosis was
never identified throughout the admission. Cardiology did not think that any
of this could be explained by endocarditis and his antibiotics were stopped
once his cultures were negative for multiple days. GI though he could of had
shock liver but he was on telemetry the entire time. His tylenol level was
normal and his hep seriologies were negative. His labs had all normalized by
admission except for his LFTs which were still trending downward.
3. Infectious disease: Due to low temperature and question of
vegetation , there was consideration for endocarditis and sepsis
although that never panned out. He has a history of feeding
stray cats and so bartonella cultures were sent. They take a
long time to come back and should be followed up as outpatient. He had been
placed on antibiotics while awaiting cultures but those were discontinued on
the 8/18/05 as the microbiology data remains negative. He had a CT scan of his
chest and abdomen which did not reveal any infectious source. He had ground
glass opacities on his CT chest which were felt to be due to CHF when reviewed
with the radiologist. He remained afebrile during the admission.
4. Psych: Early on during the patient's admission , he did have
several episodes of tachypnea at rest. They were not positional in nature
and resolved with verbal consolation and redirection and
deep breath. No associated desaturation at that time. The
patient has a history of anxiety and reported that that prompted
him to increase his Lasix dose at home. He refused psychiatric
consultation or social work involvement. His Valium had
initially been initiated but it was held in the setting of
abnormal LFTs. He had no further anxiety attacks after that. It
is likely that he has mild baseline dementia. His delirium
resolved after the acute renal failure and transaminitis resolved.
5. Musculoskeletal: The patient had a little bit of difficulty
ambulating and was seen by Physical Therapy who did think that
further physical therapy would be appropriate. The patient
refused to go to rehabilitation facility , so he was planning to
go home with services including physical therapy at home.
6. Hematology: The patient was set to go home and then it was
noted that his platelets had taken a slow and steady decline
throughout his hospitalization while he was on heparin/Lovenox. There
was concern that this could represent heparin induced
thrombocytopenia and so all heparin products were stopped. He was placed
lepirudin which was chosen instead of Argatroban because
Argatroban was cleared by liver in light of his hepatitis.
His initial PF4 was read as bordeline positive , but the laber later
changed the result to negative. Based on this discrepancy another PF4 was
sent which was borderline positive. As per the hematology consult , they felt
that despite the borderline positive PF4 he did not need prophylactic
anticoagulation and that he should refrain from heparin products in the
future until a repeat PF4 in checked in a few months.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg daily ,
Toprol XL 25 mg daily , Accupril 5 mg daily , omeprazole 20 mg
daily.
DIET: Low sodium.
ACTIVITY: As tolerated with supervision and advised by the
physical therapist.
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: Dr. Dougall is the patient's new PCP at
the GHAM MILL RIDOWN MEDICAL CENTER clinic at the Atl Hospital , he has an
appointment for 3/23/05 at 9:45 a.m. and an appointment with Dr.
Alquisira was made from Cardiology 10/21/05 at 2:45 p.m.
ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Do not take Valium or Lipitor until you
are cleared by your doctor to do so due to liver function. Weigh
yourself daily and keep a record and bring that to follow up
appointment. If you develop light headedness , shortness of
breath , chest pain or any other symptoms you are concerned about ,
call your doctor or return to the Pi Hospital emergency room for evaluation.

RADIOLOGIC DATA: Ultrasound of the abdomen showed no evidence of
portal vein thrombosis. Portable chest x-ray on 10/27/05 showed
the lung volumes considerably decreased from the previous exam on
9/29/05 .  There is hazy opacity in the lower lung sounds
particularly on the right suggesting mild edema. There also
appears to be small right effusion , mild cardiomegaly is again
noted. On 10/27/05 , CAT scan of the abdomen showed no apparent
source of infection , no collection or abscess , limited study
secondary to lack of IV contrast , mild ascites , bilateral pleural
effusions right greater than left with subsegmental atelectasis ,
presacral edema and cardiomegaly with left coronary artery
calcification. CAT scan of the chest on 10/27/05 showed
bilateral small pleural effusion , evidence of pulmonary edema and
small volume ascites associated with cardiomegaly , nodular ground
glass opacities at the right base may be due to atelectasis but
somewhat discrete , cannot exclude septic emboli but would be very
localized. A head CT on 9/29/05 showed no acute intracranial
abnormality.

Discharge Date:
CARDIOLOGY RII TERMROA UNIVERSITY OF SERVICE
ID: The patient is a 53 year old woman with a history of coronary
artery disease , status post myocardial infarction in 1986 ,
congestive heart failure who was admitted for congestive heart
failure exacerbation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has a history of diabetes ,
coronary artery disease , hypertension
not well controlled , congestive heart failure who presented with
increasing swelling , shortness of breath , and some chest pain over
the past week to two weeks and weight gain over the past month.
The patient admits to having injuried her knee while climbing a
mountain in Vocouta Na Hisa almost two months ago and having to be in
a knee immobilizer for that period of time. Was unable to do much
ambulation and was not able to cook with low salt foods as a result
of her immobility. She says the swelling then occurred. She
attempted to increase the level of diuretics that she takes at
home , which has not helped , and now present with some mild chest
pain and congestive heart failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for 20
years , hypertension not well controlled ,
coronary artery disease , status post inferior myocardial infarction
1986 , peripheral neuropathy , retinopathy , nephropathy , mild
congestive heart failure , possible pneumonia in the past , and
mitral insufficiency.
MEDICATIONS: Elavil 50 milligrams , aspirin 325 milligrams ,
Atenolol 50 milligrams b.i.d. , Lasix 40 milligrams
p.o. q.d. , insulin , lactulose 30 milliliters q.i.d. , Prilosec 20
milligrams p.o. q.i.d. , Zocor 20 milligrams p.o. q.h.s. ,
lisinopril , Tiazac 180 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. , Cozaar 50 milligrams
p.o. b.i.d.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted , ruled out for an
myocardial infarction , and began diuresis.
Required 80 milligrams intravenous Lasix , then to twice a day , and
increase that to 100 , and then 200 intravenous Lasix twice a day
and added 500 milligrams of Diuril twice a day. The patient began
to respond to the initial diuresis. Was unable to obtain an MRI to
evaluate her renal arteries , secondary to claustrophobia and
orthopnea. On July required addition of clonidine for not
well controlled blood pressure into the 180s and 190s/100 , .
Changed Captopril to ramipril for better lipophilic absorption. On
July Lasix was increased and Clonidine was also increased
from 2.5 to 5 for better diuresis and blood pressure control. The
patient was noted to have a hyperproliferative normal MCV anemia ,
was begun on erythropoietin; however , her level came back to 15
which is normal limits. An echocardiogram in October 2000 showed an
ejection fraction of 60% , normal size and function , 2-3+ mitral
regurgitation. A repeat echocardiogram done on April
showed 4+ mitral regurgitation with decreased function and an
ejection fraction of 45-50%. The patient had a chest x-ray that
showed continued pleural effusions and pulmonary edema , compared to
admission , somewhat improved. Sputum was done and had a gram stain
showing 4+ polys , gram positive cocci in clusters and chains , and a
culture which had 1+ oral flora. On March the patient
continued to diuresis well. On August creatinine to 2.6 up

Discharge Date: 9/13/1993
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: IDIOPATHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old Hispanic
female with a history of idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy for the past ten years. Patient has been
managed medically , however , recently , the patient's heart failure
has progressed to the point where conventional therapy is unable to
sustain her. The patient was admitted in September 1993 with dyspnea and
chest pain. At that time , the patient ruled out for myocardial
infarction and was discharged home on exogenous oxygen therapy.
Patient returned shortly thereafter with shortness of breath and
was begun on intravenous Dobutamine. She was subsequently
discharged home after her heart failure resolved. Patient ,
however , returned a third time with similar complaints of shortness
of breath and dyspnea and remained in the hospital awaiting a heart
transplant. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of
non-Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as a history of
treated tuberculosis. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Patient has a
history of total abdominal hysterectomy and right
salpingo-oophorectomy. Patient has no known tobacco or ethanol
history. Catheterization on May demonstrated a pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 38 with a pulmonary artery pressure of
80 systolic/50 diastolic. Cardiac index was 1.4 and an echo
demonstrated severely dilated left ventricle with an ejection
fraction of between 25 and 30%. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lasix 120 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Vasotec 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , and
two liters nasal cannula O2.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was a sickly appearing female who
was short of breath. HEENT: Unremarkable.
NECK: Remarkable for jugular venous distention to the angle of the
jaw. CARDIAC: III/VI holosystolic murmur appreciated with an S3
gallop. ABDOMEN: Liver was 13 to 14 cm. Otherwise , the abdomen
was soft. EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting edema to the mid shin.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: BUN was 24 , creatinine 1.2 , PT was 16.1 ,
PTT was 34 , white count was 8 , hematocrit
49% , and digoxin was 1.4. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 110
with a left bundle-branch block pattern and first degree AV block.
Chest X-Ray revealed cardiomegaly and liver function tests were
grossly normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient underwent a heart transplant on October
without perioperative difficulty. The patient
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit immediately
post-operatively and remained there for her first several days
post-operatively. The patient's early post-operative course was
complicated by right sided heart dysfunction and elevated PA
pressures. Echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular
function. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction
post-operatively and was managed on Dobutamine and Inocor. As PA
pressures remained elevated , the patient was switched to Milrinone
and her other pressors were weaned off gradually. The patient had
chest tubes left in place for approximately twelve days
post-operatively at which time the chest tubes were discontinued.
Patient's Swan was removed on post-operative day ten and CVP
monitoring was used to estimate right heart function. The
patient's Milrinone was gradually weaned off and the patient's CVP
remained in the 12 to 16 mm range. The patient was subsequently
transferred to the floor where she did well. The patient was
biopsied twice prior to discharge , both times demonstrating no
rejection. Of note , the patient appeared to develop Cyclosporin
toxicity early in her post-operative course with rapidly rising
creatinine levels and elevated liver function tests. The patient
was placed on Trental 800 mg p.o. t.i.d. and subsequently given a
seven day course of OKT3 after which time the patient was restarted
on her Cyclosporin with no ill effect. The patient was noted to
have a left sided pleural effusion that was tapped approximately
two and a half weeks into the patient's post-operative period. 400
cc of pleural fluid was removed which grew no bacteria out. The
patient's effusion was followed by chest X-Ray and was noted again
to reaccumulate. Approximately one and a half weeks later , a chest
tube was placed with the recovery of approximately 700 cc of fluid.
This was done with ultrasound guidance. The chest tube remained in
place approximately five days and was subsequently removed. A
residual small left pneumothorax was noted. This pneumothorax was
unchanged over the ensuing three days after chest tube removal and
the patient was discharged home with a stable small left
pneumothorax.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Patient is discharged home on
Dapsone 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Cyclosporin 225 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Imuran 25 mg p.o. q.d. , Magnesium Gluconate 1 gram q.i.d. ,
Procardia XL 90 mg p.o. q.d. , Trental 800 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,

Discharge Date: 9/21/2005
ATTENDING: VAL YAFAIE M.D.
This discharge summary covers admission 7/30/05 until 9/26/05
PRIMARY ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
OTHER MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS: Familial cardiomyopathy.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old
man with familial cardiomyopathy and a last ejection fraction of
50% well known to the heart failure service secondary to multiple
admissions for decompensated CHF in the setting of poor medical
and dietary compliance presents with gradual fatigue and
increasing abdominal girth , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , and feeling ""fluid overloaded."" He denies any chest
pain , fevers , chills , or other symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Familial cardiomyopathy , history of an
AICD placed in 2001 , last ejection fraction of 50% with a
biventricular pacing , and severe mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 , Isordil 30 t.i.d. ,
spironolactone 25 b.i.d. , torsemide 200 p.o. b.i.d. , K-Dur 20
once a day , and folate 5 once a day.
ALLERGIES: ACE inhibitors cause a cough and rash and lisinopril
causes cough.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient smoked 2 packs per day times
approximately 10 years and drinks occasional ethanol. He denies
any history of other drug use. He is married and is with 2
children. He does not work currently secondary to his
cardiomyopathy. He also has a brother who is status post cardiac
transplant.
EXAMINATON DATA: Temperature 96 , Pulse 97 , blood pressure 90/70 ,
and oxygen saturation 97 on room air. Admission weight 83.8
kilograms. JVP was greater than the angle of the jaw. Cardiac
exam was regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic murmur at the
apex. Respiratory exam showed a few bibasilar rales. Abdomen
was distended with mild shifting dullness. There was trace
bilateral extremity edema.
LABORATORY VALUES: Creatinine 1.5 , sodium 129 , potassium 2.7 ,
magnesium 2.2 , ALT 32 , AST 31 , hematocrit 40.6 , white blood cell
count 7.3 , platelets 281 , INR 1.2 , PTT 35.4 , and BNP 594.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT: This is a 36-year-old man with familial
cardiomyopathy admitted for CHF exacerbation.
Problem#1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted in
decompensated failure. He reports compliance with his
medications; however , likely some component of this
decompensation is secondary to dietary indiscretion with foods
and fluids. The patient was diuresed during his hospital stay
initially with intravenous torsemide; however , this was
unsuccessful and a Lasix drip with BNP drip was started on
hospital day #3. He reached a total weight loss of approximately
2 to 3 kilograms and was converted to oral medicines including
torsemide. Moreover , he failed to maintain a stable weight on
this regimen and ultrafiltration was attempted. That removed
approximately 900 cc of fluids. This failed secondary to
intravenous access clotting and the patient's frustration with
having to lying still. The patient was subsequently converted to
oral torsemide and metolazone , torsemide 200 b.i.d. , metolazone 5
b.i.d. , and spironolactone 25 b.i.d. as an oral regimen. Per the
patient's request and reaching a somewhat adequate goal with this
hospitalization , the patient requested to be discharged. He
reported that he would follow up with the CHF nursing staff and
with Dr. Adamski and although we repeatedly stressed the importance
of free water restriction and fluid restriction , he continued to
be noncompliant with this while inhouse. At the time the patient
was discharged , it was felt that he was not optimal
hemodynamically , but had excellent followup plans and stated that
he would return if his condition worsened.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 once a day , Isordil 10
t.i.d. metolazone 5 b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 b.i.d. , torsemide
200 b.i.d. , and K-Dur 60 b.i.d.
There are no pending studies at the time of discharge. The
patient will follow up with the CHF nurse in approximately 2 days
and see Dr. Weyhrauch in clinic within 1 week.

Discharge Date: 5/10/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. AORTIC STENOSIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 55-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery
disease , congestive heart failure and chronic renal insufficiency
who presented with substernal chest pain on April , 2002 to the
Devill Medical Center .  She was admitted by the
emergency department to the Cardiology Service and work-up revealed
aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , peripheral
vascular disease , bilateral lower extremity
claudication , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
hypercholesterolemia , renal failure after her catheterization in
2001 with her creatinine running in the high 2.0 to 3.0 range ,
congestive heart failure. The patient has had a previous stent to
the LAD and circumflex in 1999. She has also had a myocardial
infarction in 1998 associated with prolonged chest pain and has a
history of class 3 angina and class 3 heart failure.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to intravenous dye. She
developed renal failure to this. She has no other
known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , amlodipine
10 mg p.o. q. day , Isordil 30 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , Lasix 160 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH
insulin 20 units q. PM and 40 units q. AM , Epogen 2 , 000 q. day and
Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is a well-developed ,
well-nourished female in no acute distress.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended. EXTREMITIES: She had
bilateral varicosities and she is status post amputations of two
toes. Her pulses to her lower extremities were intact , but faint.
LABORATORY: Cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% circumflex
lesion , 100% right coronary artery occlusion and the
circumflex was subsequently stented. An echocardiogram performed
showed a 40% ejection fraction with aortic stenosis , a peak
gradient of 35 and a calculated valve area of 1 cm squared.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
August , 2002 for an aortic valve replacement
with a St. Jude #23 mechanical valve and a coronary artery bypass
grafting x 3 to the LAD , obtuse marginal and LVB1. The patient
tolerated this procedure well and was transferred to the intensive
care unit for close monitoring. However , the patient did develop
an uncontrolled left-sided nose bleed in the operating room and ENT
was called to pack the nose. The postoperative course was
remarkable for sluggish urine output for which Renal consult was
called in to follow. The patient was treated with diuretics and
her urine output subsequently improved. The patient was kept on
pressors and mechanical ventilation for several days and was then
extubated on January , 2002 after her volume overload was
controlled. The patient was transferred to the floor on July ,
2002 off her torsemide drip and tolerating intravenous intermittent
doses of torsemide. Otolaryngology removed the packing from the
patient's nose and she just had minor oozing after this not
requiring any treatment. Both Cardiology and Renal continued to
follow throughout the patient's hospital course and by May ,
2002 , the patient was tolerating a regular diet , urinating well
with oral antidiuretics and without subsequent nose bleeds. It was
decided that the patient was ready to be discharged to
rehabilitation at this point.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Tylenol , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day ,
Dulcolax and Colace p.r.n. , Epogen
10 , 000 units subcutaneously q. week , Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH

Coumadin p.o. q. day and she should have her Coumadin adjusted
according to her INR , simvastatin and Nexium.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in good
condition.
FOLLOW UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Dulin in six
weeks. Prior to this , she should follow up with her
primary care physician within one week and her cardiologist within
one to three weeks. Ohacli Hospital Medical Center is aware of
the plans and is helping in arranging follow up appointments.

Discharge Date: 3/18/2007
ATTENDING: ADIL , ERIC MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: COPD exacerbation.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Include pneumonia , acute renal failure and
hyperkalemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly this is a 60-year-old
gentleman with COPD on 3 liters home O2 and a history of multiple
past intubations to his noncompliant with his home oxygen therapy
and chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
approximately 2 , coronary artery disease status post end-stomy ,
diastolic heart failure who presented to the Emergency Department
with shortness of breath , chest tightness and wheezing times
several days. He also complained of a productive cough and was
found to have a room air oxygen saturation of 82% that improved
to the mid 90s on nonrebreather. He was admitted to the ICU
where he was started on BiPAP and given prednisone and nebulizer
treatments. Chest x-ray identified a right middle lobe
infiltrate and the patient was placed on vancomycin , levofloxacin
and ceftazidime. Ceftazidime was later discontinued. He was
quickly weaned to 5 liters nasal cannula. An ABG checked on
admission showed partial CO2 of 60 which is the patient's
baseline. He was also found to be on acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 4.9 that improved with gentle fluids. Potassium
was elevated at 6.4 and the patient did undergo a single run of
hemodialysis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD , coronary artery disease status post
end-stomy , diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency , hyperlipidemia
and gout.
HOME MEDICATIONS: Include aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , Norvasc 10
mg p.o. daily , Toprol 100 mg p.o. daily , Avapro 150 mg p.o.
daily , Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily , Lipitor 40 mg p.o. nightly , TriCor
48 mg p.o. daily , NPH 55 units in the morning , 34 units in the
evening , NovoLog 8 units q.a.c. , allopurinol 300 mg p.o. daily ,
Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily , albuterol 2 puffs p.r.n. , Combivent
p.r.n. , Advair 500/50 b.i.d. , multivitamin once per day , folate 1
mg p.o. daily and loratadine 10 mg p.o. daily.
ALLERGIES: There are no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: A 30-pack-year history of smoking , history of
current alcohol use , five drinks per day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On transfer to the floor temperature is
96 , pulse 82 , blood pressure 150/72 , respiratory rate is 24 ,
oxygen saturation 94% on 5 liters nasal cannula. He is in no
apparent distress. Heart is regular rate and rhythm without
murmurs , rubs or gallops. He has good air movement but
expiratory wheezes and prolonged expiratory phase. There are no
rales. His abdomen is soft , obese , nontender and bowel sounds
are present. There is 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission to the floor , BUN 211 , creatinine
3.5 , potassium 4.4. White count 13.4 , hematocrit 25.8 , platelets
492 and INR 1.3. Microbiology , numerous blood , sputum and urine
cultures are negative. Studies and echocardiogram from 7/21
shows an EF of 55-60% with no regional wall abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: This is a 60-year-old gentleman admitted for a COPD
exacerbation in the setting of likely pneumonia with acute on
chronic renal failure and hyperkalemia that has resolved since
his admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Pulmonary: The patient was kept on prednisone 60 mg p.o.
daily for the first several days of his floor admission and he
was continued on DuoNeb q.6 h. , albuterol labs were added q.6 h.
staggered with DuoNeb such that he was receiving nebulizer
treatments every three hours. He was continued on chest PT. The
patient was started on CPAP overnight for history of obstructive
sleep apnea. He had not been compliant with CPAP as an
outpatient. Advair was continued. The patient did well with
this regimen and his oxygen requirements were titrated from 5
liters to 2.5 liters at the time of discharge. At this level of
oxygen he was satting in the low to mid 90s with ambulatory sat
of approximately 90%. The importance of continuing use of home
oxygen both during the day and at night was discussed at length
with the patient , though he continued to complain that he had
difficulty going about his daily activities wearing his oxygen. Prednisone
was slowly tapered and at the time of discharge the patient was
taking 40 mg of prednisone per day. He will take 20 mg starting
the first day after his discharge and will complete a slow
approximately 2-week taper. His home dose of Lasix was
continued. The patient was not felt to be clinically volume
overloaded. However , he auto-diuresed 1-2 liters the majority
of the days he was admitted to the floor. Followup was arranged
with the patient's primary care provider and his pulmonologist
Dr. Gering . The possibility of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation
was discussed at length with the patient and his wife who were
extremely resistant to any other inpatient care. He is therefore
discharged with home VNA , though the possibility of inpatient vs outpatient
pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered at his followup.
2. Renal: The patient's creatinine trended down throughout his
time on the floor. This happened in the setting of continued
auto-diuresis , suggesting that his initial renal failure was due
to a low flow state as result of heart failure rather than
hypovolemia. At the time of discharge his creatinine was 1.3.
He was followed by the Renal Team during his admission. His ARB
was initially held but then restarted upon improvement of his
creatinine. Per renal , his elevated BUN in the range of 200 was
felt to be secondary to steroid use. This had normalized by the
time of discharge. The patient was worked up for a possible AV
fistula or graft placement in the left upper extremity in the
near future. He will follow up with vascular surgery as an
outpatient for vein mapping as an outpatient. He should not receive blood
draws in the left upper extremity of avoidable.
3. Infectious disease: The patient was continued on vancomycin
and Levaquin for a seven-day course. He completed this course
during this hospitalization and he discharged off antibiotics.
All cultures were no growth at the time of discharge.
4. Cardiovascular: He was continued on aspirin and
anti-lipidemics. His Lopressor was titrated for hypertension and
he is discharged on 300 mg of Toprol per day the rest of his
antihypertensive medicines have not changed. He was kept on tele
during his admission and did have occasional episodes of NSVT
usually triplets or couplets. These were asymptomatic.
5. Endocrine: Mr. Vitro insulin requirements increased
dramatically during his ICU admission , likely as a result of
steroid use and stress. His insulin requirements fell to their
preadmission levels during his admission on the floor.
6. Prophylaxis: He was maintained on heparin and proton pump
inhibitor.
CODE STATUS: The patient is full code.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: He is in no apparent distress.
Heart , regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs or gallops.
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes ,
rales or rhonchi. Abdomen is soft , obese , nontender , bowel
sounds are present. He has trace peripheral edema bilaterally.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Please see remainder of discharge
paperwork.
DISPOSITION: To home with VNA. He should follow up with both
his primary care doctor and pulmonologist. These appointments
have been arranged for him.

Discharge Date: 3/10/1997
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: MITRAL STENOSIS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Grief is a 74 year old black
female with a history of rheumatic
heart disease and history of atrial fibrillation who was
transferred from an outside hospital for treatment of her
symptomatic mitral valve stenosis. For the past two years , Ms.
Va had experienced a steady very gradual decline in her
exercise tolerance with a decreased ability to make her bed or
vacuum. However , she noticed this only in retrospect. On
6/4/97 , she presented to an outside hospital complaining of the
abrupt onset over one day of weakness , shortness of breath , 1/10
chest pain radiating to bilateral elbows , and dizziness. Symptoms
occurred at rest and were not positional and there were no
relieving or aggravating signs. They lasted approximately nine
hours resolving in the Emergency Department at the outside hospital
before therapy was initiated. Chest x-ray at this time showed mild
congestive heart failure which responded to Lasix 20 mg intravenous
push in the Emergency Department. She was admitted , ruled out for
a myocardial infarction with CK of 31 , 67 , 64 , and 59 , and sent to
catheterization on 3/8/97 which showed a left ostia at 30% , 25 mm
mitral valve gradient , pulmonary artery pressure of 8 , wedge of 18 ,
and cardiac output of 5.3. Echo revealed right and left atrial
enlargement , mild mitral regurgitation , mild tricuspid
regurgitation , ejection fraction was 60% to 65% , and mitral
stenosis with a mitral valve area of 0.9 cm squared down from 1.2
cm squared in 6/10 .  Ms. Sakovitch remained at this outside hospital
for one week essentially symptom free on bedrest and medical
management while awaiting transfer for definitive treatment at the
Ni Rise University Hospitals Of .  She was transferred to the Theay Hospital on the evening of 6/25/97 in good condition
and remained symptom free on bedrest. She complained of no
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , hemoptysis , fever , chills ,
nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or change in bowel or bladder habits.
Her cardiac risk factors included hypercholesterolemia ,
hypertension , she was not diabetic , did not smoke , and had a plus
or minus family history with a sister who died at 68 of a cardiac
arrest.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for rheumatic heart disease
without a history of rheumatic fever that
was diagnosed in 1994 , she had atrial fibrillation , she ruled out
for myocardial infarction in 6/10 and again prior to admission at
the outside hospital , she had a normal exercise tolerance test in
4/16 , submaximal full without anginal symptoms at baseline , she
had a history of peptic ulcer disease , a hiatal hernia , peripheral
vascular disease , and chronic bronchitis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for a left saphenous ligation.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Zocor 10
mg p.o. q.d. , isosorbide 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Coumadin 5 mg q.d. and 2.5 mg Thursday , and Lanoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
ALLERGIES: She was allergic to penicillin which gave her a rash
and to Darvocet which gave her dysphoria.
FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: Essentially noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a moderately obese white female
comfortable in bed with a heart rate of 56
and 94 , respiratory rate of 18 , blood pressure of 110-130/70-80 ,
and temperature 98.1. HEENT: Examination was essentially
unremarkable , carotids were 2+ with good upstrokes and no bruits ,
jugular venous pressure was 7 cm , pupils equally round and reactive
to light , extraocular movements intact , cranial nerves intact
bilaterally , supple neck with no lymphadenopathy , and notable for

1. Ventral hernia containing nonobstructive transverse colon.
2. Nonspecific low-attenuation segment VII hepatic lesion
3. Oral contrast remains in the stomach.
KUB postcontrast: Oral contrast from the CT abdomen and pelvis
remains in the stomach suggesting possibility of gastric atony
versus outlet obstruction.
EGD: Hypomotility of the stomach , no ulcerations , biopsies
taken. Normal pylorus and normal duodenum.
KUB post-EGD: No free air or obstruction.
Gastric emptying study: Mildly delayed emptying , no reflux.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 80 , normal axis and intervals , right
bundle-branch block , no ST or T-wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: Following several studies in the
emergency department as well as consultations from the
gastroenterologist and the general surgeons , the patient was
thought to have abdominal pain secondary to gastroparesis given
the findings on the EGD and CT as well as the negative ultrasound
and KUB. The gastroparesis was thought to be secondary to his
diabetes. He was admitted to the medical service and his diet
was slowly increased. On the floor , his pain continued , and
within two to three days , he began spiking fevers to 101 to 102.
He had a repeat abdominal CT , which showed a distended
gallbladder with circumferential wall thickening and extensive
stranding of the pericholecystic fat , which represented acute
acalculous cholecystitis. Surgery was reconsulted , and the
patient was taken to the operating room where he had an
exploratory laparoscopy , which was then converted to an open
cholecystectomy for gangrenous cholecystitis. The patient
received perioperative vancomycin , Levaquin , and Flagyl and
continued to do well post surgery with advancement of his diet
and decrease in his pain medication requirement. Vancomycin was
discontinued on 4/14/2006 after six days of vancomycin. He was
continued on the Levaquin and Flagyl. He had a drain that was
left in following surgery , and this was pulled on 4/14/2006 .
Following the pulling of the drain , he developed leakage of
green-tinged serous fluid from his abdominal wound. An abdominal
CT was done which showed a small fluid collection and no abscess.
An ERCP was done which showed a cystic duct stump bile leak.
They did a biliary sphincterotomy and stenting with no further
leak. The patient was continued on empiric Levaquin and Flagyl
following the procedure. His diet was advanced and he tolerated
this well. He had no further pain. He is being discharged on a
total of seven days of Levaquin and Flagyl following the bile
leak.
Endocrine: The patient was continued on lower-dose insulin while
he was n.p.o. and this was titrated up as his diet increased.
Cardiovascular: The patient was followed by the cardiac
transplant team. He was initially switched to IV cyclosporine
and his CellCept was held. These were transitioned to p.o. and
restarted following his improvement. Postoperatively , he got
stress-dose hydrocortisone instead of his prednisone and this was
then tapered to Solu-Medrol and then back to prednisone at his
home dose. He was fluid overloaded following the surgery. He
got 100 of IV Lasix times several doses , and then restarted on
his torsemide to maintain euvolemia. His Cartia was initially
discontinued for a question of contribution to gastroparesis , but
this was then restarted. He was discharged on all his home
medications with the torsemide at a dose of 40 mg q.a.m.
Rheumatology: Following his surgery , he developed bilateral
elbow pain , which was thought to be likely secondary to gout.
The rheumatology service was consulted. A left elbow tap was
attempted , but this did not return any fluid. He was given
several doses of colchicine p.r.n. with improvement. The steroid
taper was slowed and his gout improved. He was discharged
without any elbow pain.
Phlebitis: He developed left arm phlebitis secondary to an
infiltrating IV. This was covered by his antibiotics that were
started for his cholecystitis and his arm improved.
FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The patient will follow up with the cardiac transplant
service. This will be arranged by them.
2. The patient will need to follow up with Dr. Magdefrau from
general surgery ( 800-336-8213 ) to have his staples removed in two
weeks.
3. The patient will need to follow up with Dr. Vinion from
gastroenterology to schedule an appointment to have his stents
removed in six weeks.
4. The patient will continue to take his cardiac medications as
before. His torsemide is dosed now at 40 mg q.a.m.
5. The patient will continue on Levaquin and Flagyl as
prescribed for five days following discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg daily.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HEART FAILURE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY.
2. VALVULAR CARDIOMYOPATHY.
3. MITRAL REGURGITATION.
4. TRICUSPID REGURGITATION.
5. HYPERTENSION.
6. HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA.
7. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50-year-old man with
valvular cardiomyopathy , status post
three aortic valve replacements , who presents with no acute
complaints but a progressive decline in daily function.
Mr. Kozub history begins in 9/13 when he presented with
shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea in the
setting of medications ( Lasix and/or Procardia for hypertension )
noncompliance. He was found by echo to have severe aortic
insufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation , left ventricular
hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 45%. He subsequently
underwent aortic valve replacement along with a mitral valve
repair. Aortic valve pathology showed myxomatous degeneration.
One month post-surgery , he required repeat aortic valve replacement
with dehiscence and was documented to have an annular abscess with
cultures positive for yeast , for which he was treated with
amphotericin-B , vancomycin and gentamicin. At this time , he also
required coronary artery reimplantation and annular repair. This
hospital course was additionally complicated by development of
third degree heart block necessitating the implantation of a
permanent pacemaker. After discharge , Mr. Buzo did generally
well for the following years until 9/4 , when he again presented
with increasing shortness of breath. Echo then revealed moderate
to severe aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac catheterization showed clear coronary arteries. At this
time , his aortic valve was again replaced with a St. Jude's valve.
Again , following discharge , Mr. Kock did generally well until
4/19 when again he presented with shortness of breath. At that
time , echo showed at least mild perivalvular aortic regurgitation
with left ventricular dilatation ( The systolic diameter of 6.1 cm ) ,
along with 1+ mitral regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , and
an ejection fraction of 15-20%. Stress testing at this time showed
a physical work capacity of 15.1. It is not documented what was
done at this time , but apparently his Lasix was increased from
40 mg b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d. with good effect. Regarding this
admission , Mr. Bessemer reports that he has been feeling fine and is
here in the hospital because his doctors want to replace his valve ,
or if that doesn't work as it hasn't the last three times , to give
him a new heart all together. He reports no increasing dyspnea ,
fatigue , ankle edema or abdominal girth. He sleeps on three
pillows at night and has not recently been short of breath when
lying flat. He is able to do chores around the house without
getting short of breath , but usually does get short of breath after
one flight of stairs. He doesn't complain of significant
disability or quality of life impairment as a result of his heart
condition. He notes that he has not been able to participate in
the marching band over the last year , but that he can play sitting
down. Mr. Lonn attributes his disease to having been
noncompliant with his Procardia following the cerebrovascular
accident in 1993. He says that , ""He brought on his heart problems
himself.""
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Otherwise , notable for an embolism to his
left foot in 1998 as a result of having
stopped Coumadin therapy , chronic renal insufficiency with
creatinine ranging from 1.4-2.2 in 2/12 , and he is status post
exploratory laparotomy in 1960 from a gunshot wound.
ALLERGIES: He is allergic to Zestril , which gives him perioral
angioedema.
MEDICATIONS: Lasix 80 mg b.i.d , atenolol 50 mg q.d. , Avapro
150 mg q.d. , Coumadin 5 mg q.d. , Zantac 150 mg
b.i.d. , Niferex 150 mg q.d.
FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is negative for heart disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 35 pack-year smoking history , but quit
one year ago. He has occasional alcohol use.
Mr. Allegrini is on permanent disability leave from his job at
Des Jack Oxall , which involved a lot of heavy lifting. He lives at home
with his wife and 19-year-old son , and spends most of his day
there. He is active in Naomin Me Yonkers , where he likes to play the base
drum.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: He is a thin , healthy-appearing
black man in no apparent distress. VITAL
SIGNS: Heart rate 65 , blood pressure 120/70 , oxygen saturation 98%
on room air. NECK: His carotid pulses variance and normal in
volume. Jugular venous pressure 7 cm. LUNGS: Clear. His PMI is
vibratory in quality and prominent , lateral to the anterior
axillary line. He has a normal S1 , an ejection sound , and a loud
prosthetic S2 , a III/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal
border , and a III/IV holodiastolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border radiating to the right upper sternal border. ABDOMEN:
Non-distended , with no organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: Warm with faint
pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Remarkable for a creatinine of 2.3 , hematocrit
33.5 , with a MCV of 83.5 , RDW of 28.8 ,
reticulocyte count of 6.6 and LDH of 1077. Mr. Shadler had an echo
here that showed severe aortic insufficiency with a severely
dilated left ventricle ( and diastolic diameter of 7.0 and systolic
diameter of 6.3 ) , as well as mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 20-25%. Exercise testing
showed an oxygen uptake of 12.7. On cath , his pulmonary artery
pressure , wedge pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance was
47/16 , 13 and 379 , which fell to 26/4 , 5 , and 137 , respectively
with Nipride. His systemic vascular resistance was markedly
elevated at 2400 and a thick cardiac output and cardiac index were
3.62 and 2.31. Amlodipine was then started and Lasix was increased
in an effort to reduce his systemic vascular resistance and
pulmonary wedge pressure. The remainder of the transplant workup
results were unremarkable except for a significantly reduced
diffusing capacity of 59% corrected , a creatinine clearance of 48.4
and a prostate specific antigen of 18.1. Prostate biopsy and bone
scan were both negative. His admission was otherwise notable for
an elevated creatinine to 3.0 in the setting of perioperative
levofloxacin and gentamicin , as well as aggressive vasodilator
therapy. He was allowed to drift back down to his baseline of low
2's before discharge.
Mr. Krough was discharged home in stable condition on the following
medications:
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Lasix 120 mg b.i.d. ,
Coumadin 5 mg q.d. , amlodipine 2.5 mg q.d. ,
Avapro 150 mg q.d. , Niferex 150 mg q.d. , ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: He will follow-up with Dr. Lon Poat in
two weeks.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 53 year old , white male
with insulin dependent , adult onset
diabetes mellitus , past alcohol abuse , cardiomyopathy , congestive
heart failure , and seizure disorder , who has been relatively
disabled due to shortness of breath , since 1992. The patient was
at home on the day of admission when he noted difficulty lighting a
cigarette with his right hand , as well as keeping it in his mouth.
The patient had difficulty speaking and his arm became
progressively weaker over the next several hours. The patient was
able to eat and drink with some difficulty. He noted word finding
difficulty , dysarthria , and arm weakness. The patient denied
headache , visual problems , loss of sensation , loss of
consciousness , urinary symptoms , diplopia , vertigo , nausea ,
vomiting , or difficulty ambulating. The patient was brought to the
Emergency Room by his son when his symptoms continued to worsen.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is significant for
alcoholism , cardiomyopathy , congestive heart
failure , coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction ,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by focal motor
seizures with hyperglycemia , deep venous thrombosis , venostasis
ulcers , cellulitis , diabetic retinopathy , idiopathic eosinophilia ,
asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , gout ,
hepatosplenomegaly , and ascites.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Medications on admission include
hydroxyurea 500 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q day , insulin
NPH 30 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. , Indocin 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
p.r.n. gout , and Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day.
ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to Penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: His social history is notable for occasional
alcohol use. Of note , his last use of alcohol was
one week prior to admission. The patient had previously used
alcohol quite seriously , with one case of beer q day times 33
years , quitting heavy alcohol use after his myocardial infarction.
The patient smokes tobacco one pack per day. He used cocaine for
three years but quit cocaine use three years prior to admission.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Review of systems is notable for very poor
exercise tolerance with a one block maximum
limit. The patient stops due to shortness of breath and
claudication. He also has two pillow orthopnea.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a pleasant , obese , middle aged ,
53 year old , white male with a right facial
droop and in no acute distress. Temperature is 97 , pulse 84 , blood
pressure 126/70 , and O2 saturation is 99 percent on room air. His
heent examination was notable for no nystagmus and no diplopia.
His tongue was deviated to the right. His neck was supple with a
full range of motion. He had no bruits or lymphadenopathy. His
cardiac examination revealed tachycardia , regular rate and rhythm ,
S1 and S2 , and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard loudest at the
axilla. His lung examination showed fine crackles at the left base
with diffuse wheezes. His abdomen was obese , soft , distended , and
non-tender. He had normoactive bowel sounds and liver span of 15
cm. His extremity examination was notable for chronic venostasis
changes , right greater than left , with 1+ peripheral pulses. His
neurological examination was notable for his being alert and
oriented times three. His ability to name was intact but he had
word finding difficulty. He had no right and left confusion. He
had downward droop of his right nasolabial fold , as well as a right
oral droop and a central seventh deficit. His tongue showed right
deviation. His sensory ability was intact overall. He had
decreased motor tone in his right upper extremity with 4/5 strength
in his right arm. His right arm lacked coordination and he had
difficulty initiating movement with his right arm but his strength
was still 4/5. His left upper extremity was 5/5 strength with good
coordination. His lower extremities were both 5/5.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium was 140 , potassium 4.8 , chloride 104 ,
bicarbonate 19 , BUN 44 , creatinine 1.6 , and
glucose was 164. White count was 11 , 000 , hematocrit 43.3 , and
platelet count was 163 , 000. PT was 14.1 , INR 1.4 , PTT 29.1.
Urinalysis showed 20 to 25 hyaline casts with 3-5 red blood cells.
There were no white blood cells.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Service
with a presumptive diagnosis of a left sided
stroke. A head CT was performed on hospital day number one but was
negative with no evidence of cerebral infarct or bleeding.
However , a follow up head CT on hospital day number three
demonstrated acute infarct in the left insular capsule and left
corona radiata. A carotid ultrasound was obtained on hospital day
number five which demonstrated bilateral carotid plaques with less
than 50 percent stenosis of both carotid arteries. Because of the
patient's history of diabetes and his cardiac history , especially
given his prior myocardial infarction , the patient was placed on a
ROMI protocol. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction
and he was given a cardiac echocardiogram on hospital day number
two. The echocardiogram demonstrated increased left ventricular
size with preserved systolic function and an ejection fraction of
65 percent. He had dilated left and right atria and he had
thickened mitral valve leaflets with 4+ mitral regurgitation , with
flow reversible into his pulmonary veins. He also had 3 to 4+
tricuspid regurgitation with slow reversal into the vena cava. He
had a trileaflet aortic valve with mild sclerosis but no
insufficiency or stenosis. He also had increased right heart size
with right heart pressures of 55 to 60 mm of mercury. He was noted
to have a trivial pericardial effusion. Of note , there was no
evidence of any thrombus in the heart. However , because of the
nature of his stroke , which was felt to be embolic by neurology , as
well as his enlarged atria. The patient was placed on IV Heparin
and he was then started on oral Coumadin for long-term
anticoagulation. The patient did very well after his stroke and
his original slurred speech improved markedly over the course of
his admission. He also regained full strength in his right arm ,
although he continued to have some decreased coordination in that
arm. The patient also demonstrated inability to swallow without
difficulty and an esophagogram with video analysis was performed on
hospital day number six , prior to his discharge. The video study
of his swallowing demonstrated that he had essentially normal
swallowing and he was cleared to go home on a regular diet. Of
note , his blood pressure tended to be low , around 100 to 110
systolic , while in the hospital , so his Lisinopril was discontinued
and he was given instructions that Lisinopril would be restarted by
his CMC attending after his discharge. His hydroxyurea was
increased from 500 mg to 1 gram q day. The patient did quite well
after his stroke and he was discharged home with services on
April , 1995.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: His discharge medications were
Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 40
mg p.o. q day , insulin NPH 30 units subcutaneous q.a.m. and 20
units subcutaneous q.p.m. , Atrovent inhaler two puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.
wheezing , multivitamins one capsule p.o. q day , Coumadin 4 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , and Indocin 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. gout pain.
DISPOSITION: DIET: The patient is on an ADA 1800 calorie diet.
ACTIVITY: He has no activity restrictions.

5. Endocrine
6. Pain
7. Psychiatric
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of multiple
myeloma , and worsening BPH ( benign prostatic hypertrophy ) ,
requiring a Foley. The patient was seen in Randuke Hospital on the day of admission and was noted to have a
hematocrit drop from the 37 range to 28.5 along with hypotension
and an increasing creatinine rising from 1.2-2.3 in one week's
time.
The patient was noted to have recently significantly increasing
lower extremity edema. He reports that over a 3-4 day period , he
went from having almost no edema to having very large legs , which
he describes ""tree trunks."" The patient reports that these were
painful at first , but are no longer painful. He reports that
they were always symmetric. The patient reports no prior history
of CHF ( congestive heart failure ) , or any severe cardiac
problems , which he is aware , but does report having heart attack
at 27 years old. The patient did not know the details of these
cardiac events at 27 years old , and has received minimal followup
for this issue. He does report that he was intermittently seen
by a cardiologist , and had a normal catheterization four years
ago. He reports he has never had an echocardiogram.
The patient also reports an episode of 30-minute chest tightness
the day prior to admission while he was having a Foley catheter
placed. The patient did not tell anyone about this at that time ,
and this pain desisted on its own. The pain was described as
substernal burning pain , with no left arm pain , no jaw pain , no
shortness of breath or diaphoresis , and no nausea or vomiting.
The patient has had no orthopnea or PND.
The patient has had a recent history increasingly worsening BPH.
The patient has a 15-year history of BPH , and is followed by Dr.
Tod Cutshall at Kernmilf Nadrock Hospital And Health Center .  The patient was
recently admitted to SHHC for anuria , had a cystoscopy , clot
evacuation and was discharged on 7/24/05 with a Foley in place.
The patient followed up with Dr. Queen on 10/21/05 , had his
Foley removed , but failed this trial and he represented to an
outside hospital with clots and anuria. The patient's bladder
was irrigated and the Foley was replaced. He reports that he has
been passing clots but that he has been passing urine. The
patient also reports that his urine while having clots at times ,
is mostly clear and yellow , and that he continually makes urine
and has to replace the Foley bag.

BRIEF PHYSICAL EXAM:
Vital signs: Temperature 96.5 , pulse 70 , blood pressure 100/62 ,
respiratory rate 20 and the patient is satting 95% on room air.
General: The patient is alert , oriented , in no acute distress ,
and is not ill appearing. HEENT: Normocephalic , atraumatic ,
oropharynx is clear. No lesions or ulcers. No lymphadenopathy.
Anicteric sclerae. Cardiovascular , has JVP elevated to the angle
of the jaw. Regular rate and rhythm , with frequent premature
beat. No S3 or S4 appreciated. Pulmonary: A few crackles at
the left base otherwise clear to auscultation. Abdomen: Soft ,
nontender , bowel sounds present and normoactive. No
hepatosplenomegaly , no frank dullness. Extremities: 2-3+
pitting edema to the knees , symmetric bilaterally , shins
lukewarm. Strength 5/5 throughout in upper and lower
extremities. Neurological: The patient is alert and oriented
x3 , has normal affect. Reflexes in the biceps , patellar , and
Achilles tendons are equal bilaterally. Sensation grossly intact
on upper and lower extremities.
PERTINENT LABORATORY RESULTS:
On admission , the patient's white blood cell count was 7.2 , his
hematocrit was 28.5 , down from 37 one week previously. The
patient's platelet count was 238 , 000. The patient's chem-7 was
unremarkable with the exception of a creatinine of 2.3 , up from a
baseline of 1.2-1.4 over one week's time. The patient had a BNP
checked , which turned out to be 312 , elevated. The patient has
also had several recent imaging studies including renal
ultrasound on 2/6/05 , which showed multiple bilateral renal
cysts but no obstruction. An abdominal MRI was obtained on
2/20/05 , which showed small amount of ascites , an enlarged
prostate , multiple renal cysts , no other pathologies was noted.
The patient also had a CT to evaluate his ureters on 10/8/05 ,
which showed no stones in the kidneys or ureters , but an enlarged
prostate.
A cystoscopy report from 9/23/05 from a recent admission to
Ma Faulkmark Hospital showed oozing from tortuous veins in
the prostate.
The patient had an EKG , which showed first-degree block with a
left bundle branch block , and frequent PVCs. This was noted to
be present on an old examination , after consultation with an
outpatient cardiologist at Perlaw Memorial Hospital .  The patient
had a troponin I of 0.11 , slightly elevated. The patient's CK
was 136 , MB fraction 4.3 , both within normal limits. On
admission , the patient coagulation parameters showed an INR of
1.2. Other pertinent data includes an orally reported cardiac
catheterization at Beckry Hospital in 2001 , which showed no
obstructive coronary disease , but diffuse coronary artery
disease , with an ejection fraction of 50%. An adenosine MIBI
obtained in 2002 at Peacepe Planthugh Memorial Medical Center showed possible old
inferior infarct , global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of
35-40%. An echocardiogram obtained during this admission
demonstrated the patient's EF at this point to be 25% , rather
with global hypokinesis.
OPERATIONS OR PROCEDURES:
There were no operations or procedures performed during this
admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
Cardiovascular - the patient was determined initially to be
likely in congestive heart failure , with elevated neck veins , and
increased leg edema and a low blood pressure. Because the
patient was determined to be in CHF , he was diuresed with IV
Lasix , and later with p.o. Lasix , the patient was diuresed
approximately 2 liters per day over a 4-5 period. The patient's
blood pressure subsequently rose. After consultation with
Cardiology , it was determined that a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor should be added to the patient's medication regimen as
his blood pressure would allow , for demonstrated benefit and
congestive heart failure.
Because the patient was initially determined to have some risk of
myocardial infarction , had reported chest pain the day prior to
admission , and had slightly elevated troponins. The patient's
troponin and CK-MB were followed until they began decreasing. It
is likely that these very small elevations were due to small
amount of ischemia from demand , due to the patient's fluid
overload and anemia. The patient was continued on his statin
medication.
The patient on admission had frequent PVCs , and some short runs
of ventricular tachycardia lasting less than 5 beats. After
diuresis , the patient had no further runs of VT , and had only
minimal ectopy. The patient's electrolytes including potassium
and magnesium were checked daily and repleted as necessary.
Aspirin was withheld from the patient for now , despite having a
benefit in cardiac disease of this kind. This is because the
patient's hematocrit was low and he had recently had bleeding
likely from his bladder. Urology Department was consulted
regarding this decision.
Renal/genitourinary: The patient has a long known history of BPH
and is followed closely at Cotson Tionlo Hospital by Dr.
Josue Grefe . The patient was recently admitted for these
problems due to obstruction , and instrumentation. On admission ,
the patient's urine did not have any red blood cells , and he had
no obvious clots at any point. After consultation with Urology ,
and after the patient had been diuresing well with Lasix , the
patient's Foley catheter was removed and after this point he had
no problem with urinating. The patient was maintained on Proscar
in addition to Flomax.
Heme: The patient's hematocrit drop was likely due to two
factors. First of all , the patient is known to have been losing
blood in the form of clots from his bladder. This is likely due
to bleeding from the surface of his prostate where a recent
cystoscopy had demonstrated tortuous veins. In addition , the
reading of hematocrit of 24.5 on admission was likely secondary
to dilution , the patient was massively fluid overloaded. The
patient's hematocrit rose after diuresis , and was maintained in
the 31-32 range without transfusion during admission. He was ,
however , typed and screened , and the plan was to transfuse him
should his hematocrit decrease below 30 , given his cardiac
history.
Oncologic: The patient is followed closely by Dr. Zecchini at
Hool Norhunt General Hospital .  His most recent treatment was on
8/4/05 and his multiple myeloma seems to be responding well to
therapy. During this admission , multiple myeloma was not an
active issue. See Reb Memorial Hospital notes for more information.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes , he
takes Lantus and Novolog at home. He was continued on these
medications while as an inpatient.
Pain: The patient was offered oxycodone p.r.n. for pain. He did
not complain of any pain during admission.
Psychiatric: The patient , though pleasant and cooperative on
admission , became increasingly combative. On the night of
1/5/05 , he became very combative , and attempted to hit one of
the cross covering physicians. The patient was initially tried
on several medications to control this agitation including Ativan
and Zyprexa. These apparently were not effective at first. The
patient continued to have difficulty sleeping and was very
agitated. At one point , he would not take his medications.
Psychiatry was involved , and after much discussion with the
patient and involvement of social work , the patient did calm down
and agreed to medical care. At one point when he became
agitated , he was given Haldol intravenously , in addition to
Ativan , after being given these medications , the patient slept
very well through the night. When he awoke the next morning , his
mood was much improved , and he apologized for his behavior ,
reporting he did not know what happened. Because of the change
in mental status , several studies were obtained to investigate
this , a head CT showed no acute disease , only some bony changes
likely chronic due to multiple myeloma. In addition , the
patient's electrolytes were checked which were normal , the
patient's fingerstick blood glucose was checked which was normal.
In addition , an RPR was sent , in addition to folate and B12.
These labs were pending at the time of discharge and will be
followed up by his outpatient physicians.

KEY FEATURES OF PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE:
At the time of discharge , the patient was mentating very well ,
thinking clearly , and was pleasant and cooperative. The
remainder of the patient's exam was much improved from his
admission and his lower extremity edema had decreased to 1+ , and

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1 ) HYPOTHYROIDISM.
2 ) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
3 ) HYPERTENSION.
4 ) HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year-old woman
with a history of myocardial
infarction , atrial fibrillation , hypertension and congestive heart
failure who presents with shortness of breath.
The patient is status post inferior posterior myocardial infarction
on March , 1998. Thrombolysis was deferred secondary to severe
hypertension ( systolic blood pressure was greater than 200 ).
Catheterization revealed 80% RCA stenosis with thrombus. She
underwent PTCA and stenting and ReoPro under the Lakeni Ralton Rooson Hospital study.
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 45% , inferior
posterior lateral hypokinesis , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , 2+
mitral regurgitation , moderate aortic insufficiency. She was
treated with Ticlid for 30 days , aspirin , Lopressor , Verapamil and
Captopril. That hospital course was complicated by asymptomatic
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the setting of pneumonia and new
diagnosis of hyperthyroidism ( TSH less than assay , T4 16.1 , T3 133 ,
THBR 1.24 ). She was started on Procainamide and subsequently as an
outpatient on PTU without recurrence of atrial fibrillation. She
has been treated with Coumadin. On April , 1998 , she was admitted
for left upper extremity weakness with a question of transient
ischemic attack in the setting of subtherapeutic INR. Head CT scan
was negative and brain MRI/MRA was also negative. On September ,
1998 , she was admitted to Hillh Hospital for flash pulmonary
edema requiring intubation. She was in normal sinus rhythm , but
hypertensive. She ruled out for myocardial infarction and repeat
catheterization showed patent stent , otherwise unchanged. She was
subsequently started on Lasix and was well until the night prior to
admission when she developed gradually worsening shortness of
breath , wheezing and chest pain. Also , she had an increase in
orthopnea from one to two pillows , diaphoresis and worsening of her
baseline right shoulder pain with no edema. She had a cough
productive of scant white sputum for three days prior to admission ,
no fever or chills. In the emergency room , her blood pressure was
found to be 230/100 with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air
increasing to 95% on two liters. She had crackles one-third of the
way up her lung fields bilaterally. EKG was in normal sinus
rhythm. Chest x-ray showed edema and effusion. She improved
quickly with oxygen , nitrates and Lasix.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,

SOCIAL HISTORY: She immigrated from the Pa Drive , Meroesun Geworth in
1981. She lives with her daughter and has a two
pack per day smoking history times 40 years. She has no alcohol
use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , she was breathing
comfortably , supine at 30 degrees. Vital
signs: Temperature 98.4 degrees , heart rate 61 and regular , blood
pressure 153/75 , respiratory rate 18 , with an oxygen saturation 93%
on three liters. HEENT examination revealed that the sclerae were
anicteric. Pupils were equal , round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements were intact. Oropharynx was benign. Neck
revealed that the jugular venous pressure was elevated to her ear.
Carotids were 1+ on the right , 2+ on the left. There was a
question of a right carotid bruit. There was no thyromegaly.
Lungs revealed crackles half way up bilaterally , no wheezing.
Cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm with an S4 ,
intermittent S3 , no murmurs. Abdomen revealed normal active bowel
sounds , soft and non-tender , mildly distended with a pulsatile
liver. Extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. There
were 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. There was no calf
tenderness. Skin was warm and dry. Neurological examination
revealed that cranial nerves III-XII were intact. Motor was five
out of five throughout. Sensory was intact to light touch
throughout. Reflexes were 2+ bilaterally with downgoing toes.
Rectal examination was guaiac negative in the emergency room.
LABORATORY: Admission laboratory studies revealed a sodium of 140 ,
potassium 4.4 , chloride 105 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 19 ,
creatinine 0.6 , glucose 149. White blood cell count was 12.3 ,
hematocrit 38.8 , platelet count was normal. CK was 44. Troponin
was 0.03. INR was 1.8. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 90 with
old inferior Qs , left ventricular hypertrophy with strain in I and
L which were old , T-wave inversion in III and V6 as well as
pseudonormalized T-waves in V1 through V4 which are new compared
with October , 1998. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , pulmonary
vascular redistribution , Kerley B lines , but no infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Congestive heart failure: The assessment was
that the patient presented in acute congestive
heart failure , most likely due to diastolic dysfunction in the
setting of hypertension. Other contributing factors possibly
playing a role in the patient's heart failure could have included
medication non-compliance and dietary indiscretion. Another
possibility entertained was that the patient could have had
transient atrial fibrillation triggering heart failure , however all
of her EKGs showed her to be normal sinus rhythm , questioning this
possibility. The patient was diuresed with intravenous Lasix and
stabilized on p.o. Lasix during her hospital course.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction by CKs , Troponin and EKG.
2 ) Hyperthyroidism: The patient's TSA was measured to be at less
than assay on May , 1998 raising the possibility that uncontrolled
hyperthyroidism could also be contributing to her cardiac
dysfunction. An Endocrine consult was obtained with the
recommendation that her PTU be increased to 100 mg t.i.d. Her T4
and THBR were measured and found to be 8.1 and 0.91 which were
within normal limits after the increased dose of PTU. The patient
is to receive follow-up in the Thyroid Clinic for definitive
therapy , possibly iodine ablation of known thyroid nodules in her
left lobe.
3 ) Elevated white blood cell count on admission , but with a normal
differential: The patient remained afebrile throughout her
hospital course. Urinalysis was negative for infection and repeat
chest x-ray showed no infiltrate.
4 ) Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remained in the
range of 110-155/50-70s during her hospital course on Atenolol ,
Isordil and Lisinopril.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )
Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Lasix
80 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. 5 ) Lisinopril
40 mg p.o. q. day. 6 ) Procainamide SR 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. 7 ) PTU
100 mg p.o. t.i.d. 8 ) Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q. day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with VNA services
to check weights and assistance with medication.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Pastor on February ,
1998 and Dr. Rais in the Thyroid Clinic on August ,
1998.

DISCHARGE DATE AND TIME:
The patient is being discharged from the Medical Intensive Care
Unit at 1:00 p.m. on the 2/17/2004 .
DISPOSITION:
The patient is to be discharged to Ant University Hospital today.
ADMISSION DATE:
The patient was admitted to Trote Hospital on
2/4/2004 and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care unit on
6/29/2004 .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
The patient was admitted to Biand Valley General Hospital with the
diagnosis of changes in mental status secondary to hypercarbia.
The patient was admitted to Medical Intensive Care Unit with
hypercarbic respiratory failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for COPD , CHF , CAD , non-insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus , renal insufficiency , chronic venostasis , cellulitis ,
obesity , gout , sleep apnea , asthma , hypertension , urinary
retention , degenerative joint disease of the right knee. The
patient is status post CABG 1999 three vessels. The patient has
an 80-pack-year smoking history. The patient is on two liters of
nasal cannula at home. The patient is full code.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a long history of
COPD who is on 2 liters of nasal cannula at home with
80-pack-year of smoking history.
Briefly , the patient is an 80-year-old gentleman who was admitted
to Astine Emount Wallca Medical Center on 2/4/2004 with drowsiness and
slurred speech. Initial ABG showed pH of 7.25 , PCO2 of 82 , PO2
of 56 , sating 87%. He quickly awakened after Narcan was
administered. Recently , he had been taking an increased amount
of opiates for pain and he was admitted with a diagnosis of
hypercarbia secondary to increased opiate intake and COPD flare.
The patient had a long history of COPD. He has an 80-pack-year
of smoking history and is normally on 2 liters of nasal cannula
at home. He was initially treated for COPD on the floor and
given gentle hydration as he also suffers chronic renal
insufficiency. He was given Percocet for pain control. The
patient appears to be improving by serial arterial blood gasses.
Had decrease in creatinine and improved mental status. At 11:00
a.m. on the 6/29/2004 the patient was found breathless and
pulseless. At that time , his ABG showed a pH of 7.04 , PCO2 of
95 , PO2 of 47 , he was sating 54%. An ACLS code was 1. The
patient received 1 mg atropine and 0.04 of Narcan. He appeared
to be aspirating when intubated. He was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit where he was until 2/17/2004 , when he was
discharged.
ALLERGIES: The patient has questionable penicillin allergies
with unknown reaction.
PERTINENT PHYSICAL EXAM:
In general , the patient is an obese Hispanic male who is sedated
and intubated. He responds to commands and is oriented to voice
on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. His skin showed
his lower extremities with changes of chronic venostasis. He had
erythema to the knees , nonpitting edema bilateral to the knees
and induration of skin on legs , medial thigh , and bilateral
popliteal fossae. His feet had onychomycosis bilaterally with no
clearcut abrasions or cuts. The rest of his skin exam was
remarkable for multiple ecchymoses , one weeping plaque on the
abdomen at heparin injection site. His right subclavian line was
nontender and nonerythematous with one leaking port. Head and
neck exam: His pupils were equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodations. His extraocular movements were intact. His
oropharynx was clear. His endotracheal tube and OG tube were in
place. His chest sounds were clear anteriorly. He had decreased
breath sounds laterally. He had isolated wheezing at the left
midclavicular line. His heart sounds , S1 and S2 were heard. His
abdomen was obese. He had a large panus , no appreciable
organomegaly , tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds.
Extremities: He was moving all four extremities spontaneously.
They were warm and perfused. Neurologically , his cranial nerves
were grossly intact. There were no focal anomalies.
On addition , the patient had a sodium of 140 , a potassium of 5.4 ,
chloride of 104 , carbon dioxide of 24 , BUN of 72 , creatinine of
2.1 , glucose of 153. She had an ionized calcium of 1.04 and
magnesium of 2.1.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Pulmonary. The patient was admitted to the MICU with
hypercarbic respiratory arrest and aspiration pneumonia per
symptoms , signs and chest x-ray. Given the history and timing of
the arrest , the patient likely was hypercarbic secondary to COPD
exacerbation , as hypercarbic arrest occurred several days in
house where opiates were not administered. It is highly
improbable that the arrest happened secondary to opiate ingestion
rather patient likely had COPD exacerbation. Also , the patient
has significant cardiac history of CHF and CAD , which may have
contributed. Subsequent chest CT on the floor demonstrated that
in addition the patient had very significant pleural effusions.
The patient was treated for aspiration pneumonia with
levofloxacin and Flagyl and aztreonam. He was also treated with
albuterol Atrovent nebulizers. Aggressive physical therapy was
also provided for the patient. The patient after completing his
antibiotic treatments for aspiration pneumonia was noted to have
MRSA growing in his sputum. He was given a 14-day course of
vancomycin as well to treat MRSA pneumonia. To help the
patient's pulmonary status , significant diuresis was attempted.
The patient was typically diuresed at 1-2 liters per day. The
aggressive diuresis was estimated to have taken in the
neighborhood of 15-20 liters of the patient and this likely
remarkably helped the patient's breathing status and his ability
to get off the ventilator. The patient had a tracheostomy and
peg placed on 8/27/04 and began breathing on trache collar on
the 6/11/04 and has been breathing until the present time
successfully on trache collar.
2. ID. The patient was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. He
was also colonized with MRSA and VSE by the end of his course.
During his initial MICU admission he was diagnosed with
vancomycin sensitive enterococcal UTI. He was treated with
antibiotics for all of these. His aspiration pneumonia was
treated with levofloxacin , aztreonam and Flagyl. Subsequent MRSA
pneumonia was treated with vancomycin. The patient has not had ,
at the time of admission , white count or a significant fever and
his cultures two days prior to discharge have been negative.
3. Cardiovascular. The patient has a significant cardiac
history for CHF and CAD. His heart rhythm has been mostly stable
during the course of his hospitalization. Hypertension has been
treated with Lopressor.
4. Renal. The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency. However , renal function had improved during the
patient's hospital course. At the time of discharge , the patient
had a creatinine of 0.9 , a BUN of 38 , a potassium of 3.9 and a
creatinine of 0.9. Presumably , the aggressive diuresis that was
conducted did not affect the patient's renal function adversely.
5. Endocrine. The patient has a history of
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. He was put on Lantus
and insulin sliding scale , by the end of his day he was on 80
units of Lantus plus requiring additional insulin on the sliding
scale.

CONSULTANTS:
Hematology of BH , Dr. Bradley Ebanks .
ASSESSMENT:
This is an 88-year-old Co Louis Awestinsde male with a history of
hypertension , diabetes , CHF who presented with increasing
shortness of breath likely secondary to CHF and also presented
with a fever concerning for pneumonia for which he was treated
with antibiotics. The patient also had a new diagnosis of
amyloid during this admission.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: The patient has no known diagnosis of CAD;
however , he has many risk factors. The patient had a troponin of
0.7 on admit which subsequently trended down. This troponin leak
was thought to be due to demand. The patient remained chest
pain-free during his entire hospital course , and had no acute
ischemic issues. The patient was continued on his aspirin ,
beta-blocker and statin medications.
B. Pump: The patient has a history of CHF with an EF of 40-45%.
In the past , this congestive heart failure had been presumably
attributed to ischemic for hypertensive etiology. However ,
during this admission , the patient had a cardiac biopsy that was
positive for amyloid suggesting that amyloid is the cause
underlying his CHF. The patient appeared mildly fluid overloaded
on admission. He was successfully diuresed with 100 IV Lasix for
several days. The patient has been switched to his home dose of
Lasix of 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and was euvolemic for several days
prior to his discharge. His euvolemic weight on 8/10/07 was
64.5 kilograms. His discharge weight will be reported in an
addendum. During this admission , he was continued on his
beta-blocker. His calcium channel blocker and diltiazem was
discontinued during this admission given his likely restrictive
heart physiology with his new diagnosis of amyloid. The patient
was started on a nitrate during this admission in order to reduce
preload. As mentioned above , the patient had a catheterization
with an endomyocardial biopsy that was positive for amyloid. A
panel of other amyloid-related tests were also sent out. Of
note , serum genetic amyloid testing was pending at the time of
discharge. Of note , the patient had a serum immunofixation test
that was within normal limits. The patient had a urine
immunofixation test with a positive monoclonal spike with Lambda
light chain. The patient also had a serum-free light chain assay
that was equivocal/positive. The patient also had positive
proteinuria on a spot urine. The patient also had a bone marrow
biopsy done by Dr. Jarred Canner of MOMH in order to further
define this subtype of amyloid that this patient has and in order
to facilitate a screening of his family members for amyloid. He
also had a bone marrow biopsy given the monoclonal spike on his
urine immunofixation test.
C. Rhythm: The patient has a pacemaker originally put in for
sick sinus syndrome. He is V-paced. The patient was discovered
to be in atrial fibrillation on this admission. On 7/9/07 , the
EP Service changed the pacemaker setting to VVI given that the
patient was in atrial fibrillation and decreased the heart rate
to the 60s-70s. The patient remained on telemetry throughout his
stay which was uneventful. The patient was also started on
Coumadin for anticoagulation given his atrial fibrillation and
the diagnosis of amyloid. The patient remained subtherapeutic
and on 7/11/07 , his INR was still subtherapeutic at 1.5 , and he
will most likely be discharged on Coumadin 3.5 mg every evening
which will be adjusted as necessary at the Rehabilitation
Facility.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient presented with a mild cough.
The patient had a fever on admit but was afebrile after one to
two days on antibiotics. The patient had no leukocytosis.
Again , there was a question of pneumonia on the chest x-ray and
his clinical findings were suspicious for pneumonia. The patient
received a five-day course of levofloxacin at 750 mg daily. The
course of antibiotics ended on 1/27/07 .  The patient had blood ,
urine and sputum cultures which were negative.
3. Heme: The patient has baseline anemia between hematocrit of
31 and 32 which remained stable during his hospitalization. The
patient also has a baseline thrombocytopenia with platelets at
approximately 170 which remained stable throughout his
hospitalization and again the patient as stated above was started
on Coumadin during this admission for atrial fibrillation and for
amyloid. The Coumadin was slowly increased up to 3.5 mg given
subtherapeutic INR. The patient had a bone marrow biopsy done on
5/10/07 as mentioned above in order to further define the
amyloid ??_?? and because of the monoclonal spike on the urine
immunofixation. The final results of the bone marrow biopsy are
pending.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. At first ,
he was on his home dose of NPH insulin which was 20 units
subcutaneous daily as well as an insulin sliding scale. Because
of persistent hypoglycemia , the patient's NPH was reduced to 10
units of NPH insulin subcutaneous daily.
5. FEN: The patient had a low-salt diet and a 2-liter fluid
restriction and was seen by Nutrition inhouse.
6. Renal: The patient had a creatinine of approximately 1.0
which stayed stable throughout his hospitalization.
7. GI: The patient has chronic LFT abnormalities likely
secondary to CHF; however , the etiology is uncertain.
8. Question restless leg syndrome: On 2/19/07 , the patient was
complaining of myoclonic jerks of his right leg which is an old
problem. His general exam was within normal limits. He was
given a trial of magnesium supplementation inhouse for this.
9. Low back , sacral pain: His low back pain appears to be
chronic and it was treated with oxycodone successfully. The
patient also was noted to have a skin tear on his right buttock
which showed no signs of infection and a DuoDERM was placed over
it for wound care. The patient also had a stage I sacral
decubitus ulcer and a DuoDERM was placed on it for wound care and
for protection.
10. Prophylaxis: The patient was on DVT dose Lovenox inhouse
and was also on Coumadin.
11. Physical Therapy: Of note , the patient has a left BKA. The
patient's family brought in his prosthetic leg as well as his
walker. Physical Therapy inhouse worked with the patient , and it
was determined that the patient was unsafe to go home and it was
recommended that he go to a rehabilitation facility to which the
patient finally agreed.

Discharge Date: 10/12/2006
ATTENDING: KRAUS , RALEIGH LOUIS MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67-year-old female
who is transferred from an outside hospital for further
management of her CHF. The patient is a 67-year-old female with
history of coronary artery disease who was first evaluated back
in 2002 when she had a stent placed at THC for symptomatic
coronary artery disease. She reports feeling well until 10/14
when she developed substernal chest burning and pressure and was
admitted to Trowestpot Allch Memorial Hospital , where a dobutamine echo was
positive for ischemia , details unclear and she was transferred to
IIAH for further care. At Deran Medical Center ,
angiography was performed on 8/7/06 with placement of a Cypher
stent in her LAD. The evening following discharge , the patient
reported severe substernal chest pressure and activated her local
EMS. On the way to the hospital , she suffered a Vfib arrhythmia
requiring CPR and 9 defibrillations. At Geft.o Ton Memorial Hospital ,
she was acutely intervened upon with PTCA and found to have a
thrombosed LAD stent. At this point , she was transferred to
R. Medical Center Of on an intraaortic balloon pump for
support. Repeat angiography was performed revealing suboptimal
deployment of the initial stent , which was subsequently outsized
to a diameter of 3.5 mm and additional stenting was performed
distal to the original stent with good anterograde flow noted
postprocedure. The patient was managed in the CCU , where she
remained intubated on the intraaortic balloon pump. Hospital
course was notable for distributive and cardiogenic shock as well
as aspiration pneumonia and HSV , treated with acyclovir. She
improved after two weeks and was discharged on 5/14/06 with an
EF of 40% at the time of discharge. The patient was readmitted
to Tacan Hospital And on 6/16/06 with a CHF exacerbation , was
subsequently diuresed and discharged on 1/27/06 .
Echocardiography at that time demonstrated an EF of 55% with 2 to
3+ MR and RVSP of 45 mmHg. The patient represented to Harl Hospital on 9/23/06 reporting progressive dyspnea , weight
gain , PND , orthopnea and cough. At that time , she underwent
repeat angiography demonstrating RA 14 , RV 55/13 , PA 61/25/42 ,
PCWP 35 with V 246 , LHC with AO 86/57. Angiography revealed a
right dominant circulation and LMCA , which was patent , LAD 20%
mid , D1 40% , ostial left circumflex 20% mid , RCA 60% prox , LV
gram with an EF of 25% associated with global hypokinesis and
severe MR. The patient was subsequently transferred to Palm Health Systems for further management of her advanced heart failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant in addition to above for
hypertension , type 2 diabetes on insulin , obesity , COPD ,
hyperlipidemia , GERD , hypothyroidism , depression , status post
appendectomy and status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Include aspirin 325 daily , Lasix 80 mg
IV b.i.d. , Diovan 160 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , levothyroxine
88 mcg daily , Lipitor 20 mg daily , Zetia 10 mg daily , Aldactone
25 mg daily , Protonix 20 mg daily , Advair 500/50 one puff daily
and insulin 70/30 , 30 units subq b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Include erythromycin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband and works in
a clothing company. She smokes 1-2 packs per day x46 years until
nine years ago. No alcohol use. No illicits.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient reports coronary artery disease in
one sibling. No premature cardiac catheterization. Mother died
of cervical cancer. Father died of alcoholism.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denies fever , chills , nausea ,
vomiting , abdominal pain , hemoptysis , bright red blood per
rectum , hematochezia , or melena , no chest pain or palpitations.
Positive for cough and shortness of breath. No changes in mental
status or loss of consciousness , no dysuria , no exposures. No
recent travel. No presyncope or dizziness.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for creatinine of 1 from
baseline of 0.7 to 0.8. Hematocrit of 34 , baseline 37. ALT 68 ,
AST 33 and alkaline phosphatase 384 down from 616 on last
admission. INR 1. EKG , sinus rhythm at 90 , normal axis
intervals with old anterior septal MI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for afebrile , heart rate in the
90s , blood pressure 98/60 , respiratory rate 18-20 , satting 98% on
3 liters. The patient was in no acute distress , pleasant ,
resting comfortably. Oropharynx clear. JVP 10 cm with 2+
carotids without bruits. No thyromegaly , no lymphadenopathy.
Decreased breath sounds with bibasilar crackles with prolonged
expiratory phase and intermittent expiratory wheezing. Regular
rate and rhythm , S1 and S2. Notable S3 , no MR appreciated.
Abdomen was obese , distended , soft , nontender , no
hepatosplenomegaly. Positive bowel sounds. Extremities , 1+
lower extremity edema to the shins with 1+ DP and PT pulses
bilaterally. Pretibial erythema , right greater than left. No
other rashes. Right groin minimally tender without bruit. Cath
site clean , dry , intact. Neurologic exam is nonfocal.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: In summary , this is a 67-year-old female
with multiple cardiac risk factors including hypertension ,
hyperlipidemia , diabetes , coronary artery disease status post LAD
stent complicated by a subacute thrombosis with marked left
ventricular dysfunction with a reportedly revascularized right
coronary territory and severe MR on repeat echo. Despite
diuresis at the outside hospital , the patient remained volume
overloaded with biventricular failure on exam. The patient was
admitted to medically optimized heart failure regimen to further
clarify component of mitral regurgitation. Repeat TTE and right
and left heart catheterization to further evaluate and optimize
medical management. The patient was maintained on aspirin ,
Plavix , ARB , statin and Zetia. Beta-blocker was continued at low
dose given decompensated state. Adenosine MIBI was completed ,
which was notable for recovery 1 mm ST depressions in leads II ,
III and aVF , which resolved. There is no further evidence of
ischemia. EF was notable to be severely depressed; however ,
moderate MR on outside hospital echo was not reproducible here.
Cardiovascular surgery was initially consulted to further
evaluate for benefit of mitral valve replacement surgery;
however , this will likely not be of benefit given mild MR on
repeat echo. In addition a contrast echo was performed to
further evaluate for evidence of clot given the severe right
ventricle malfunction , and anticoagulation was started; however ,
there was no evidence of clot on echo. In addition , on echo ,
reevaluated for dyssynchrony , which was negative. The patient
was diuresed with IV Lasix until near euvolemic and then
transitioned to p.o. regimen. The patient was maintained on
Aldactone. The EP service evaluated for possible placement of
AICD versus biventricular pacemaker; however , given the patient
is not yet outside of three-month window and was noninducible on
EP study , she will need close monitoring as an outpatient with
repeat echo in 2 months and a further EP study to readdress. The
patient will be anticoagulated in the meantime. Respiratory:
The patient has history of COPD with no evidence of acute
exacerbation. Inhalers were continued. PFTs and VO2 study may
be considered as an outpatient. Renal: Creatinine was mildly
elevated compared with baseline , likely secondary to mild dye
nephropathy and overaggressive diuresis. Creatinine stabilized ,
will need to be followed closely as an outpatient as well as
electrolytes. GI. The patient was maintained on a bowel
regimen. LFTs were elevated on admission consistent with right
heart failure versus statin. LFTs trended down on admission.
Hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable at baseline. The
patient will remain on heparin to Coumadin bridge with Lovenox
bridge as an outpatient if needed. Endocrine: The patient has a
history of poorly controlled diabetes and was maintained on
insulin as an inpatient with sliding scale coverage. History of
hypothyroidism , on Levoxyl. TSH within normal limits. ID: No
acute issues. The patient was treated for asymptomatic
bacteriuria secondary to possible permanent pacemaker placement.
She developed itchiness , which is likely secondary to the
Bactrim. Provided supportive care , the patient should avoid
Bactrim in the future secondary to intolerance. No serious
reactions were observed. Psychiatric: The patient has a history
of depression. She was continued on home medications. FEN: The
patient was maintained on a cardiac diet with sodium and volume
restriction , K mag scales. Nutrition was consulted.
Dermatologic: The patient has a history of HSV , status post
acyclovir treatment. No evidence of further infection. The
patient had pretibial erythema , which derm was consulted for ,
which they felt was consistent with venous stasis. She improved
with steroid cream and compression. The patient was prophylaxed
with Protonix and heparin. The patient was instructed to follow
up with cardiology , weigh herself daily with careful notice to
weight gain reporting to the physician and to returne to the ED
with worsening shortness of breath or chest pain. The patient
was instructed to follow a fluid restricted , low-fat ,
low-cholesterol diet as well as a restricted sodium diet. She
will follow up with her PCP Dr. Kuhnke at 786-179-5001 on
1/4/06 at 2:45. Dr. Yatsko at 051-469-9935 on 3/12/06 at 3:45.
INR will be drawn on 1/1/06 with followup INRs to be drawn
every five days. INRs will be followed by PCP.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
86 yo man w/ acute renal failure , gross hematuria , bladder mass.
RENAL:
*ARF* Original ddx included prerenal ( decreased PO intake , glucosuria )
vs. renal ( URI --> glomerulonephritis ) vs. postrenal ( mass , clots -->
B obstruction ... but no hydronephrosis ). Cr came down from 5.3 to near
nl w/ hydration suggesting prerenal etiology. Urine examined under
microscope was without red blood cell casts. On presentation , pt. had no
acute indication for dialysis. He was not uremic , had no rub , had good
urine output , had mild acedemia , and had normal K.As noted , his Cr came
down to near normal with hydration.
*bladder mass* A bladder mass surrounded by blood clots was identified on
the patient's admission CT. Due to conern for bladder cancer , urine
cytology was sent. Results are pending. On 8/19 , the urology team
performed a cystoscopy which revealed a large bladder stone surrounded by
hemorrhage. The clot was evacuated and the stone was broken up by
electrohydraulic lithotripsy. Biopsy samples were
taken from the inflamed bladder wall. Pathology results are pending. A
3-way foley catheter was placed and continuous bladder irrigation was
initiated. The patient received peri-procedure antibiosis with ancef and
gent. The large size of the bladder stone suggests urinary retension ,
perhaps due to persistent BPH ( despite 2000 TURP ). The patient was started
on flomax and proscar , as recommended by the urology team. The patient was
discharged with a foley catheter in place. He will return to NC urology
clinics on 10/22 for a voiding trial.
CV:
pump
*HTN* In house , pt. was treated with norvasc and lopressor. He was
discharged on norvasc and toprol XL. Ace inhibition was not initiated due
to the patient's renal insufficiency.
*murmur* On exam , pt. had a systolic ejection murmur heard best at the
R and L upper sternal border and radiating to the carotids. An ECHO
revealed a preserved ejection fraction of 65% , no RWMA , nl
diastolic function , normal RV size and function , nl LA and RA size ,
and mild AS with a valve area of 1.4. The patient is not
symptomatic from his AS , by history. He denies syncope , chest pain ,
orthopnea , PND , or LE edema.
rhythm: NSR
ischemia:
*CAD*
Pt. reported no chest pain. His admission EKG showed new inferior/lateral
ST-T changes. Cardiac markers revealed CK 330 , CKMB 7.5 , and Tn I<assay.
His EKG changes could represent old infarct ( although ECHO showed no
RWMA ) or could represent demand ischemia in the setting of
hypertension and anemia. Pt. was treated with a bblocker , as above. Pt was
not treated with ASA given his hematuria , but such
therapy may be started on an outpatient basis. Pt. was not treated with an
acei due to his creatinine , but such therapy , too , may be started on an
outpatient basis. Pt. may also benefit from outpt. stress testing. Lipids
profile showed cholesterol 156 , triglycerides 119 , HDL 39 , LDL 93.
GI: *reflux* Pt. was treated with nexium and mylanta PRN.
He was maintained on a cardiac , diabetic diet.
ENDO: *new DM , most likely type II* On admission pt. had a small anion
gap , mild elevation of +B-hydroxybutyrate , and +ketones in his urine.
With hydration , his gap closed. The ketoacidosis was likely from
starvation. Pt's HGa1c was 10. ( He had not seen a physician in years ). He
will be d/c'ed on glipizide 5. ( Metoformin was not started out of concern
for rising creatinine. He may benefit from the addition of a second oral
agent as an oupatient ). Pt. will be given a glucometer and asked to check
his blood sugar mornings.
HEME: *anemia* Pt. had a normocytic anemia , likely related to hematuria ,
gu+ stool. Iron studies revealed a Fe 49 , TIBC 294 , Ferr 73. He
was started on a multivitamin with iron. He would benefit from outpatient
colonoscopy. Prior to discharge , hematocrit was stable in the mid 30s.
ID: Pt. was afebrile. Admission u/a was suggestive of UTI. Ucx , however ,
was negative. CXR was clear. Pt. received abx peri-cystoscopy.
PROPH: pneumoboots ( pt. was not treated with lovenox given his
hematuria )
CODE: full
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Pt. will require VNA for nursing and home PT.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
45 yo M with multiple cardiac risk factors ,
including known CAD s/p MI ( 10/12 with PCI to LAD , complicated by
instent thrombosis 1 week post-cath->successfully restented ) ,
HTN , dyslipidemia , obesity , and positive FHx
presents with acute onset of chest pain. The patient
has had several episodes/admissions for recurrent
c/p since then with caths consistently
demonstrating non-significant disease. Last cath in 3/8
showed R dominant system with 30% proximal LAD lesion.
ETT-MIBI in 1/23 ( 9:30 , 5.2 METS , HR 153 , BP 130/80 , was non-ischemic
but terminated 2/2 fatigue ) showed large fixed defect in
anterior , anteroseptal , anterolateral , inferior , LV
apex with EF of 35%. Seen 9/7 at GH for
syncope , dx with VT and had AICD
placed.
On this occasion
he noted sudden onset of 8/10 chest pain while
at rest at 6:30 pm on the evening of admission.
The pain was sharp/stabbing and was bilateral
with radiation to the L arm. He also had
diaphoresis , SOB , and nausea but denies vomitting , F/C ,
LH , dizziness. He took 1 TNG SL with some relief.
EMS transported to Greena Hospital where his vitals were 98.2 , 73 , 92/62 ,
15. Rec'd IV TNG , heparin , MSO4 , ASA with pain down to 4/10.
Transfered to ITH .  A: 45 yo M with known CAD s/p MI in 10/12 ,
s/p recent ICD placement for syncope/VT at BMC ,
now with his angina at rest. Given non-oclusive
CAD on multiple recent caths ( including 2 mos ago
at EHC per patient ) , likelihood of ischemia now
is low.
P: CV: Ischemia-r/o MI , asa , toprol , heparin , plavix , zocor. Ruled out
by ensymes , ETT was non-ischemic. Pump-euvolemic , no h/o CHF
Rhythm-has AICD , on tele , replete lytes
GI: has lost 40 lbs on liquid diet , consider nutrition consult as
outpatient
CODE: FULL CODE
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please be sure to contact Dr. Klussmann ( 485-738-3098 ) to set up an
appointment to be seen in about 1 week. Also , be sure to set up an
appointment to see Dr. Helfgott ( 717-968-0482 ) in about 4 weeks.
You should contact your doctor or return to the emergency room if you
experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain , chest pressure ,
shortness of breath , dizziness , lightheadedness , nausea , vomitting , or
any other concerning symptoms.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Consider increasing CCB as patient seems to feel it helps his
symptoms.
2. Consider adjusting HTN meds as patient was relatively hypotensive
( SBP 90-110 ) in hospital ( althought asymptomatic ).
3. Consider outpatient cardiac rehabillitation.
4. Consider nutrition consult as outpatient to ensure adequate
nutrition status on ""liquid diet""

Discharge Date: 5/26/2005
ATTENDING: QUINCY BRIDENBAUGH MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypoglycemia.
2. Altered mental status.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. Volume overload likely secondary to CHF.
2. Possible pneumonia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for:
1. Bilateral occipital CVAs.
2. Diabetes , on insulin.
3. Hypertension.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. Coronary artery disease.
6. Visual impair with tunnel vision.
7. Monoclonal gammopathy.
8. Bilateral occipital CVAs.
9. History of left upper extremity thrombophlebitis.
10. Microcytic anemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman who was found at home with
altered mental status by home services and home nursing with
confusion. Her fingerstick was 37 , which increased to 42 with
orange juice with improvement of her mental status. Her insulin
regimen has been stable for quite some time. She had taken her
regular dose of Novolin 40 units on the morning of admission.
She was sent to the emergency department. She has noted
increasing bilateral lower extremity edema over one or two
months , increased dyspnea on exertion , nocturia. In the ED , her
ambulatory sat was 91% on room air. Glucose was still low and on
chest x-ray there was evidence of a right pleural effusion and
right lower lobe consolidation versus atelectasis. She was given
Lasix , glucose , Levaquin , and blood cultures were drawn. She was
admitted for treatment of pneumonia.
She has an allergy to propoxyphene.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 80 mg p.o q.d. in the morning , 40 mg p.o. q.d. in the
evening.
2. Atenolol 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Amitriptyline 25 to 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
5. Multivitamins.
6. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Folate 100 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Iron gluconate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d.
10. Novolin 34 to 40 units subcu. q.d.
11. Epogen 5000 units subcu. q. week.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Father died of an MI in his 70s , mother died of leukemia. No
history of hematologic disorders in her family. No history of
thalassemia that the patient knows of.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She lives in an assisted living facility and has extensive home
care services and lives alone. She was previously a nurse. She
has children who live nearby.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Vital signs: Temperature was 95.2 , blood pressure 111/69 , heart
rate 73 , sating 97% on room air. She was alert and oriented x3.
Speech and mentation were normal. No lymphadenopathy. 2/6
systolic murmur at the base radiating to across her precordium.
Distant heart sounds. Right lower lobe with decreased breath
sounds and decreased phrenitis , wheezing throughout her right
lung. Abdomen: Obese , soft , nondistended , nontender , benign.
Extremities: 2 to 3+ pitting edema bilateral and symmetric.
Neurologic: She was moving all extremities well. Left eye with
slight lateral deviation. Extraocular movements intact. Pupils
equally round and reactive to light. Evidence of an old
cataract.
ADMISSION DATA:
BNP of 1111 , creatinine was 2.4 which was below her baseline of
2.6 to 2.8 , white count was 6.6 with no left shift , hematocrit
was 35.7 which is up from her baseline of 27 to 33. MCV was 67.4
which is stable and it has been in this range and she was found
to have in 5/25 a monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP. EKG showed
an inferoseptal Q wave , poor R wave progression , low voltage left
axis deviation. Echo in 5/25 showed an EF of 50 to 55% with
moderate-to-severe MR and TR , septal hypokinesis and a MIBI at
that time showed no reversible ischemia. Chest x-ray as
describes above. UA negative for UTI.
IMPRESSION:
The patient was evaluated to be low likelihood for having
pneumonia. She was thought to more likely have volume overload
secondary to CHF. Because of her visual problems and declining
physical condition and deconditioning , patient's current living
situation and arrangements are possibly insufficient for her
increasing needs and error in self administration of medications
or increasing renal insufficiency or poor p.o. intake may have
precipitated her hypoglycemic episode and altered mental status.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
ID/Pulmonary: Right lower lobe pneumonia versus CHF , pleural
effusion. This was treated initially with levofloxacin although
it is unlikely consolidated lobar pneumonia because of the
patient's good clinical status , lack of fever and white count and
lack of toxicity. Sputum culture and gram stein were
unremarkable. Pleural effusion on the right decreased only
minimally with diuresis of 1 to 2 liters overnight and for
diagnostic and therapeutic purposes , the patient underwent a
thoracentesis on 3/1/05 and had withdraw 800 cc of clear yellow
fluid whose chemistries and cell count were consistent with a
sterile transudative effusion. Gram stein was negative.
Cultures are pending at this time and a chest x-ray may be
repeated to rule out underlying pneumonia revealed by draining of
the effusion. Urine legionella was negative.
Renal: Chronic renal insufficiency. Creatinine is at a baseline
of 2.6 and it decreased significantly on this admission possibly
because of improved forward flow from discontinuation of her ACE
inhibitor.
Endocrinology: The patient was admitted with hypoglycemic
diabetes possibly secondary to infection or logistical and social
barriers. Her NPH dose was cut to 20 units subcu. q.d. with
lispro sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s. which she needed only
minimally about 5 units a day and her sugars were well controlled
on this regimen which supports the hypothesis that her NPH dose
of 34 units a day was too high beyond a certain point.
Cardiac:
A. Pump: The patient with CHF , known valvular dysfunction ,
exhibiting pulmonary edema , lower extremity edema and orthopnea.
She was initially diuresed with IV Lasix and it was noted that
her weight was up 10 pounds from her prior admission. She was
transitioned to p.o. Lasix after diuresing very well on this
regimen. She continued her Lipitor and aspirin , atenolol was
changed metoprolol given her renal insufficiency. Lisinopril was
switched to captopril , then discontinued given her bumping
creatinine while diuresing on the ACE inhibitor. She was
slightly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 90s to
100s at one point and responded to a bolus of fluid , decrease in
the captopril and holding the Lasix , unclear etiology , looks
otherwise low. Lasix was decreased to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and the
patient should have daily weights and electrolytes checked and
repleted to ensure that her diuresis is only moderate everyday no
more than one liter a day but is consistent such that she is able
to maintain her electrolytes and loose fluid overtime.
Heme: The patient has a monoclonal gammopathy and a microcytosis
which might suggest thalassemia. She is on iron and Epogen with
an improved hematocrit from the prior admission but no change in
her MCV , which suggests that she has more than renal disease
causing her microcytosis. Further workup of her monoclonal
gammopathy will be deferred to her primary care physician.
Diabetic diet: Low sodium , low fat , low cholesterol.
Prophylaxis: Heparin and H2 blocker.
DISPOSITION:
The patient has been screened for admission to Jack Nor Medical Center Of where
she will go today. Her goal is intense physical therapy and
learning greater independence in her daily functioning. Her
pelvic films were negative for fracture. She should be ambulated
t.i.d.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Amitriptyline 25 to 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
5. Multivitamins.
6. Aspirin325 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8. Lisinopril should be held for the moment.
9. Iron gluconate 325 mg p.o. q.i.d.
10. NPH 20 units subcu. q.h.s.
11. Lispro sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s.
12. Epogen 5000 units subcu. q. week.
Ms Mengel should follow up with Dr. Rufener when she is able to
within the next week or two. Ellington is her primary care
physician , Jarrett Sandlan her PCP number is 653-609-3621. She
should b switched to Toprol as her blood pressure tolerates and
to lisinopril as her creatinine tolerates after low-level
diuresis of about 50 cc to one liter a day. Studies pending
include cytology and culture of pleural fluid and follow-up chest
x-ray on the day of her discharge. Lasix dose can be increased as
needed for better diuresis.

prostatectomy presents w/ 2 d hx SOB , confusion , shoulder pain. Pt
was in USOH out w/ wife to lunch Friday ( 3 d PTA ) before admission ,
ate onion soup and club sandwich , then on Sat felt nauseated , SOB ,
confused. Wife noted that pt could not lie down to sleep Sat night
( usually 3 pillow orthopnea ). Sx cont through Sun , wife brought to ED
on Mon , day of admission. Pt recently in LRMC ED , rx for UTI 1/7 .  In
ED pt afebrile , HR 59 , BP 152/61 , Sa 97% on 4L NC. On exam found to
have JVP elevated 12-14 cm H2O , bibasilar rales , dec breath sounds at
bases , RRR , no murmurs , no gallops , 1+ pitting edema bilat LE. Labs
significant for Na 144 Cl 113 , Hco3 19 , BUN 30 , Cr 1.9 , platelets 97.
UA showed 15-20 WBC , 2-5 RBC. EKG was unchanged , CXR showed worsening
bilat pleural effusions.
Hospital Course:
1. CV- Pt was not r/o secondary to low probability of ischemia. CHF
exacerbation likely secondary to Na overload from pt's meal the Friday
before admission. Pt was diuresed gently with 20 lasix IV x 2 on the
first day of admission and then received 20 po lasix on the day of
discharge. The pt's pulmonary status and mental status improved with
diuresis and his JVD decreased to approx 8 cm H2O on exam.
2. ID: pt w/ presumed UTI , rx w/ bactrim
3. Disposition: Pt was eval by PT , who made recs for home PT for the
pt. This arrangement was satisfactory for the pt and his wife. He
will follow up with all of his physicians with his regular scheduled

Discharge Date: 4/1/2006
ATTENDING: JESCHON , SHANE M.D.
SERVICE: GMS PACE team.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CHF exacerbation.
LIST OF DIAGNOSIS DURING ADMISSION:
1. CHF/dilated cardiomyopathy
2. Chronic headache.
3. Chronic abdominal pain.
4. Iron deficiency anemia.
5. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 61-year-old female with a
past medical history significant for CHF exacerbations , dilated
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 25-30% , history of depression ,
bipolar disorder , and history of polysubstance abuse who
presented to Ami Ge County Hospital on 10/2/2006 ,
complaining of worsening shortness of breath and abdominal pain.
The patient had noted that she had increasing lower extremity
edema , decreased appetite and nausea; however , she had no weight
loss. Of note , the patient was recently admitted overnight on
3/3/2006 , with similar complaints. In the ED , the patient
complained of abdominal pain , which reportedly is chronic. Pain
is thought to be related to keloids at the sites of her open
cholecystectomy scar and hysterectomy scar. The patient had a
CAT scan of her abdomen done on her last admission on 6/2/06 ,
which showed diffuse micronodular opacities with wide ranging
differential diagnosis including infectious colitis , lymphoma , or
mastocytosis. A colonoscopy is recommended for further
evaluation. The patient was admitted to the hospital for control
of her shortness of breath , which was related to CHF exacerbation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for dilated cardiomyopathy ,
history of depression , bipolar disorder , polysubstance abuse , and
hepatitis C.
PREADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , Elavil 100 mg
q.h.s. , Klonopin 0.5 mg b.i.d. , iron 325 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg

mg daily , Aricept 5 mg daily , Seroquel 300 mg q.h.s. , Prilosec 20
mg daily , and potassium chloride 40 mEq daily
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to penicillin and
erythromycin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient currently resides at home alone.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for chronic headache and chronic
abdominal pain , as well as worsening shortness of breath as noted
above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile.
Heart rate 92 , blood pressure 154/91 , and respiratory rate 18.
O2 saturation was 100% on 2 liters and 96% on room air. The
patient was comfortable in no apparent distress. She is awake ,
alert , and oriented x3. The patient had an elevated JVD. Her
heart was regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2. Chest
was positive for bibasilar crackles and wheezing throughout.
Abdomen was obese , soft , and nondistended. Diffuse tenderness ,
especially at cheloid site. Extremities , 2+ pitting edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , creatinine 0.9 , BUN 21 and
hematocrit 36.1. BNP was greater than assay. EKG with normal
sinus rhythm with a rate of 80 , which showed biatrial
enlargement , LVH and a prolonged QT. This was unchanged from
prior EKGs. Chest x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly with no acute
cardiopulmonary process.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient's shortness of breath was
attributed to her CHF , and the patient was treated with Lasix 80
mg IV b.i.d. with a goal of greater than 1 liter negative per
day. The patient's weight was monitored daily. On admission , it
was 180.4 pounds and on discharge , it was 167 pounds. The
patient's creatinine was also closely monitored and it did bump
to 1.3 on 4/18/2006 , but then on discharge , it went back down to
1.1. The patient was discharged home on her usual home dose of
Lasix , which is 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient's ambulating O2
saturation was 99% on room air. The patient did have some
intermittent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
She remained asymptomatic. Her electrolytes were repleted
aggressively and the patient's metoprolol was increased from 12.5
mg to 25 mg t.i.d. As a result , the patient was sent home on
Toprol 75 mg daily instead of her prior home dose of 50 mg daily.
The patient had cardiac enzymes checked because of her
intermittent episodes of NSVT. The patient's troponin was less
than assay. She was continued on aspirin , spironolactone ,
lisinopril , Imdur , Zocor , and Cozaar. The patient also has
outpatient appointments with cardiology in the CHF clinic.
2. GI: The patient has a history of chronic abdominal pain and
a history of ischemic colitis. Pain during this admission was
similar to previous pain. On exam , the patient was diffusely
tender; however , it seemed to mostly be at the site of her
keloids. The patient was referred to have an outpatient
colonoscopy. The patient's primary care physician was notified
to arrange this procedure.
3. Neurology: The patient has a history of chronic daily
headaches and migraines , and she had a persistent headache during
this admit. She was treated with Tylenol , Reglan and warm
compresses p.r.n. , which did control her pain. The patient also
was continued on Elavil. A followup appointment in the headache
clinic was made with Dr. Fabello on 1/7/2000 .
4. Psychiatry: The patient has a history of drug seeking
behavior. No narcotics were prescribed for headaches during this
admission. She was continued on Klonopin 0.5 mg q.12h. and
Aricept 5 mg daily. New psychiatry followup appointment was
arranged prior to discharge.
5. Hematology: The patient had both microcytosis and
hypochromia by RBC indices , which were suggestive of iron
deficiency anemia. She was continued on her iron
supplementation.
6. Dermatology: The patient did complain of some right deltoid
pain. On exam , right deltoid was tender and erythematous;
however , it did improve without any treatment and on day of
discharge , it was only mildly tender with no erythema.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was continued on Nexium and was
given Lovenox 40 mg daily for DVT prophylaxis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On discharge , the patient's vital signs
were stable. Her JVP was flat. Lungs were clear , and the
patient only had trace edema in her lower extremities. Weight on
discharge was 167 pounds. Oxygen saturation while ambulating
with 99% on room air.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was given a prescription for
her new increased dose of Toprol 75 mg p.o. daily. The patient
had physician home care set up for her where she will have CHF
monitoring and daily weights. The patient was instructed on a
1.5 liter fluid restriction at home and low-sodium diet. The
patient is to follow up with her primary care physician , Dr.
Cary Genco on 6/1/2006 , at 11:00 a.m , follow up with
Dr. Tillotson , psychiatry on 7/14/2006 , at 1:00 p.m. , Dr. Booker G Fracassa from cardiology on 1/26/2006 , at 9:00 a.m. and Dudley D Crout in CHF Clinic on 5/25/2006 , at 3:30 p.m. Lastly , the
patient is to follow up in the headache clinic with Dr. Durant

ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 44yo fem who was undergoing an outpt GI workup for abd
pain N/V and was recently started on Reglan. She p/w and 3-4wks of DOE ,
orthopnea , PND , and LE swelling , BNP=870. Was admitted for treatment of
CHF.
---
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV:
*Pump: Cont'd ACE ( Lisinopril 40daily ) , utilized Lasix ( max Lasix dose
40IV bid ) to initiate diuresis. Orthopnea resolved after 3days of
diuresis. ECHO obtained on HD#4=nl LV size w/mild conc hypertrophy , and
severely reduced function ( EF15-20% ) and global hypokinesis. Mod RVE
and hypertrophy , and globally reduced function. Mild LAE , mod RAE.
Trace to mild MR , mod to severe TR , trace PR , and sm pericardial
effusion. The CHF service consult ( Dr. Busler ) obtained hx of 20oz
port wine consumption 3+days/wk. CHF team is attributing non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy to idiopathic vs ETOH. Rec'd goal SBP<120 ,
agreed w/diuresis , ACE , +/-adding ARB , and changing b-blocker back to
Atenolol.
CHF team advised there is was clear indication for anti-coagulation. F/u
appts made Houston Jackson Hugo K. Torain . Pt will have VNA-CHF
home services.
Admit wt=197.6lbs , d/c wt=185.5lbs.
*Isch: Hx of NSTEMI , pos MIBI , neg cardiac cath 11/3 .  Has a baseline
abnormal EKG that is concerning for inf/lat ischemia. Had a troponin
leak this admit in setting of CHF. Repeat CAD workup not pursued. Cont'd
Aspirin , and B-blocker ( was initially on Metoprolol 25tid , then
transitioned back to Atenolol 50daily per CHF service recs ).
Tchol=119 , HDL=26 , LDL=77. Pt is DM , but no statin was started b/c of
elevated LFTs.
*Rhythm: Episode of NSVT 10/23 ( R-on-T VT in setting of QT prolongation
QTc=526 ). No additional ventricular arrhythmias were recorded on
via continuous telemetry monitoring. CHF service advised deferring AICD
placement unless pt fails 6mos of optimal medical CHF managment. Repeat
EKG's 10/13 QTc=495 , 5/9 QTc=478. Decision was made to cont Fluoxetine ,
given the minute risk that this med would contribute to QT prolongation.
2. GI:
*Team suspects hepatocongestion/GI venous congestion and/or gut ischemia
from poor arterial perfusion as cause of recent GI c/o's and LFTs. Low
grade abd pain and N/V resolved as team treated CHF , transaminases
remained ess unchanged.
PRN Reglan was continued. If GI symptoms return , pt may need additional
outpt workup ( HIDA scan , gastric emptying study ). Pt has an existing GI
appt to see Dr. Skwara in 11/13 .
*Cont'd PPI for gastritis , duodenitis seen on EGD 10/25 .  It is unclear if
this can completely explain pt's Fe def anemia. She will need an outpt
colonoscopy to further eval.
*Celiac sprue studies were sent=pending at time of discharge.
3. ENDO: hx of DM-2 , HgA1c=8.8. Pt advised team that she prefer to
discontinue Glucophage in favor of starting insulin. During this admit DM
was managed w/bid NPH , pre-meal novolog , and AC/HS novolog scales. On
10/13 pt's total insulin requirement was 44units. FSBS 6/12 8am ) ,
271( 12pm ). Pt to transition to Lantus 35units qam to begin 7/25 .  VNA
arranged for insulin teaching and to assist PCP w/dose titration. Syringe
education was provided.
4. HEME:
*RBC: microcytic hypochromic fe deficient anemia. RI=2.19. Pt did not
save stool to perform stool guaiac testing. Cont'd Ferrous Sulfate this
admit , added Colace and Senna for constipation prophy. Will likely need
outpt colonoscopy , team deferring this to PCP and Dr. Daso ( outpt GI ).
Hg-electrophoresis was sent=pending at time of discharge.
*Coags: mildly elevated PTT/INR this admit. Suspect nutritional
depletion of vit K +/- ?liver dysfunction from CHF/liver congestion
leading to mild auto-anticoagulation. INR improved as pt able to
tolerate POs. She was not treated w/Vit K.
5. MISC:
*Nutrition consulted for heart failure and DM diet teaching.
TH social worker was consulted to assist pt w/maintaining abstinence
upon discharge. Pt given instructions to f/u w/her outpt Jerrod J Whitehill at Insonmahunt , New York 40955
*Full code during this admission.

ATTENDING: BRICE ARMSON M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS ON ADMISSION: This is a 73-year-old
female with known coronary artery disease , status post CABG , now
with CHF of 30% and a long history of second hand smoke
inhalation , who presented with shortness of breath. One week
prior to admission , she had had upper respiratory infection
symptoms and with some sick contacts. One day prior to
admission , the patient began with increased shortness of breath
over a 3 to 4-hour period while lying down. She came to the
emergency room where she was found to be wheezing. She did not
have any chest pressure or pain , but she did have some shortness
of breath and a cough productive of white sputum. She had no
wheezing , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and no change in her eating
habits. No missed medications. She denied any PND , DOE or
orthopnea , and she had not noticed increased leg edema. In the
emergency department , she was given Atrovent , prednisone , Lasix ,
albuterol nebulizers and Solu-Medrol as it was unknown at the
time whether or not this was a CHF exacerbation or a COPD
exacerbation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile at 97.5 with a pulse of
71 , blood pressure of 111/63 , and respiratory rate of 18 ,
saturating 98% on 2 liters. Physical examination was more
significant for a DVD at 10 cm. Heart exam was significant for
gallops being absent. No S3 or S4. Respiratory exam was
significant for some wheezes , but no rales however.
ADMISSION LABORATORY: A Chem 7 was significant for hyponitremia
at 132 and a hyperkalemia at 5.4. Her digoxin level was
therapeutic at 1.8. Total bilirubin was 1.8. A BNP was mildly
elevated at 189. First set of enzymes were cardiac enzymes to
rule out MI were negative.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: The patient's admission medications were
digoxin 0.25 mg daily , Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d. , Lipitor 80 mg daily ,
Coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d. , spironolactone 12.5 mg daily , aspirin 81 mg
daily , nitroglycerin p.r.n. , and Lasix.
ALLERGIES: Included Captopril , which gave her a cough.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lived with family. Denied any drinking and
smoking , but however did have significant second hand smoke
inhalation history by her husband having been a heavy smoker
during their many years of marriage.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease in
which she had an acute myocardial infarction in 1995 for which a
stent was placed in the LAD. She then had an instant V stenosis
and had then a two-vessel CABG , which was the SVG to the LAD , and
the SVG to the RCA. In 1997 , she had a SVG , LAD stent to
stenosis to then to VStent. In 1988 she had a third SVG LAD
stent placed and an ICD was placed for a low VF and presumably
arrhythmias. The cardiac risk factors include hypertension ,
hyperlipidemia , and smoke inhalation history.
She was admitted for shortness of breath , presumes likely
secondary to a CHF or reactive airway disease precipitated by an
upper respiratory tract infection.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. The patient was cycled through
three sets of enzymes , which were all negative. The patient did
not have chest pressure or pain at any moment of her
hospitalization and did not need any nitroglycerin. There were
no EKG changes. She was continued on her statin , beta blocker ,
and ACE inhibitor , and aspirin. Cardiovascular pump. The
patient oscillated between the mildly fluid overloaded to
euvolemic. She was maintained on Lasix , and did well that way.
The patient received an echo on May , 2004 , which showed
normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with
overall systolic function being moderately in pair with ejection
fraction of 35%. There was severe hypokinesis and akinesis
involving the mid distal septum apex and distal inferior and
lateral walls , and there was also abnormal septal motion
consistent with intraventricular conduction delay. An ICP was
seen to be in place and the aortic valve was mildly calcified.
The left atrium was mildly enlarged. There was also moderate
tricuspid regurgitation with velocity of 2.9 m/second detecting
pulmonary artery systolic pressures of 33mmHg. It was determined
that since 7/26 there had been no significant interval change.
Rhythm: The patient was in normal sinus rhythm with an ICD
placed. There were no issues.
2. Pulmonary: Initially when the patient was admitted with her
significant coronary history , she was being treated like a CHF
exacerbation. However , despite her being relatively refractory
treatment it was decided to increase the treatments for a
possible COPD exacerbation. In this way , she was receiving
Duonebs and albuterol nebulizers 2-2 hours alternating and it was
decided to change her from p.o. prednisone to 60 mg p.o. q.a.m.
In addition , Tessalon Perles and guaifenesin was added. Finally ,
azithromycin was added so as to possibly treat any atypical
pneumonia as the patient had only some interstitial pattern on
her chest x-ray , and did not have any focal area of
consolidation.
3. Endocrine: When the patient was admitted , she was maintained
on her home dose regimen for diabetes mellitus. However , when
being admitted she was given p.o. prednisone for COPD
exacerbation , and therefore , had uncontrolled blood sugars.
Because a finger stick blood glucose and insulin sliding scale
did not fully control her blood glucose. She at one point began
to have an non-gap metabolic acidosis. Anticipating possible
decay , she was started on regular lab draws and insulin drips.
Her gap promptly closed and the patient was , otherwise ,
asymptomatic. She did not have any potassium , fluid or other
complications. Throughout she was also receiving NPH insulin in
the a.m. and p.m.
The patient was discharged to follow with her primary care
physician , and the patient received at home VNA services.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her discharge medications included
1. NPH insulin10 units in the a.m. and 4 units in the p.m.
2. Flovent , Tessalon Perles and guaifenesin.
3. Zocor 40 mg daily.
4. Coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d.
5. Digoxin 0.125 daily.
6. Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d.
7. Azithromycin 25 mg daily.
8. Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily.
9. Combivent inhaler.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: DEANGELO MACK PEED MD
Ms. Mulready is a 90+-year-old woman with a history of coronary
artery disease including a non ST elevation MI in 4/13
medically managed , congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 25% and severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of
1.0 who was transferred from the Ime Tesion Hospital with shortness
of breath several days after discharge from that hospital where
she was treated for , a multilevel pneumonia and CHF exacerbation.
She had been hospitalized at Ham11 Eghe Torsa Health where she was treated for
pneumonia and after treatment had returned to her rehabilitation
facility/skilled nursing facility where she was not eating and
was found to be very tachypneic and diaphoretic and tachycardiac
for the three days prior to admission here. The night prior to
admission , she had been readmitted to Nordi Medical Center where she
was found to have a worsening CHF exacerbation with symptomatic
bradycardia with heart rate in the 20s. The patient received
diuresis , had a chest MRA to rule out pulmonary embolism , which
was negative and was transferred to Redd Hospital
for telemetry. The bradycardia was thought to have been from a
recent increase in the patient's Toprol XL dose. On admission ,
the patient was afebrile. Temperature 96.5 , pulse in the 70s and
80s , pressure 140/80 , breathing a 100% on four liters. Exam
significant for an awake , alert , pleasant older women , very hard
of hearing , decreased breath sounds with rhonchi right greater
than left and decreased breath sounds in the right middle lobe ,
poor inspiratory effort. Exam also significant for a hard
systolic ejection murmur , crescendo decrescendo heard best at the
right upper sternal border radiating to the carotids , also
audible at the apex. Her JVP was at 12 cm. She had no lower
extremity edema. Her labs were significant for a creatinine of
2.7 , a slightly elevated dedimer at Hen Mekend Medical Center , a chest x-ray that
showed a right middle lobe pneumonia that was resolving ,
cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: There was no evidence of acute ischemia. She
had a small elevation of her troponins in the morning after
admission thought secondary perhaps to CHF exacerbation or
chronic renal insufficiency. She was restarted on a very low
dose of Lopressor keeping atropine at her bedside in case of
symptomatic bradycardia. She did have a heart rate occasionally
in the 40s during this hospitalization , but was asymptomatic
throughout. In terms of her rhythm , in addition to the
asymptomatic bradycardia , she did have several runs of
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. These diminished with
repletion of magnesium and again were asymptomatic. The
electrophysiology was consulted and they did not feel that any
intervention was indicated given the asymptomatic nature of her
arrhythmias. In terms of her congestive heart failure
exacerbation was thought to be the primary reason for her
tachypnea and dyspnea. She was diuresed gently given her aortic
stenosis and tolerated well a net fluid loss of 500 to a 1000 cc
per day with great increase in her comfort breathing. Notably
she never had an increased oxygen requirement even when
tachypneic. We will do a dry weight before her discharge and
send her out on a dose of Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. with a dry
weight to be followed at the skilled nursing facility. She will
also have a follow up appointment with Dr. Erin Bahadue at
Oer Healthcare .
2. Infectious disease: On chest x-ray , the patient has a
persistent right middle lobe process an on the second day of her
hospitalization had increasing tachypnea , was found to be fluid
overloaded and was gently diuresed as mentioned earlier. Because
a recurrence of her pneumonia cannot be ruled out , we will
complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl , which was
added for the concern of aspiration to add anaerobic coverage.
3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency. The
patient's creatinine has improved during her hospitalization and
is currently 2.0. We have replaced her magnesium and put her on
a small dose of daily K-Dur 10 mEq per day to compensate for her
Lasix diuresis.
4. Neuro: The patient was seen by the speech and swallow
service. Their recommendations were mechanical , soft , solid diet
with thin liquids , out of bed at all meals.
The patient will be discharged on Flagyl to finish a 14-day
course , levofloxacin to finish a 14-day course. The patient's
levofloxacin should be taken until 1/29/03 and the patient's
Flagyl should be taken until 8/30/03 .  The patient will also be
discharged on the salicylic acid 81 mg , Phoslo 667 mg t.i.d. ,
Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , heparin was given for prophylaxis as an
inpatient , but she should be treated according to MVCMC policies ,
lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
multivitamin , simvastatin 20 mg q.h.s. , K-Dur 10 mEq x1 p.o.
q.d. , and Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d.
She will be discharged to the EH in good condition.
Thank you for the opportunity to care for this lovely patient.

Discharge Date: 8/8/2005
ATTENDING: BOENISCH , RAUL MD
DEATH SUMMARY: The patient was a 69-year-old female with a
history of coronary disease status post prior myocardial
infarction and surgery in 2002 who presented to R.healt Medical Center Emergency Department on 5/10/05 with three days
of chest pain and shortness of breath. Of note she had been
noncompliant with prior regimens and treatments and despite
diuretics started three days by her primary care physician she
reported new shortness of breath and chest pain at rest. An EKG
in the emergency department revealed widespread ST depressions.
She was treated for pulmonary edema with IV nitroglycerin , Lasix ,
aspirin , heparin , beta-blockers , and then she was taken urgently
to the cath lab where coronary angiography revealed a left main
coronary artery thrombosis with proximal and distal stenoses of
about 70% , 50% of her LAD , and 60% of her first diagonal. The
patient was transferred to the coronary care unit after placement
of an intraaortic balloon pump for further management and
evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
CHF , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , CAD , prior myocardial
infarction , restrictive lung disease , diabetes mellitus , chronic
renal insufficiency , morbid obesity , and iron deficiency anemia.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
Aspirin , hydralazine , nitroglycerin , quinine , Norvasc , Lasix ,
Toprol , lisinopril , albuterol , and famotidine.
ALLERGIES:
She was allergic to erythromycin , Bactrim , and IV contrast.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Noted no fever , chills , sweats , coughs , abdominal pain , nausea ,
or vomiting.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She was morbidly obese with moderate respiratory distress lying
at about 30-degree angle. Her O2 saturation was 97% on 3L nasal
cannula. Temperature was 99 degrees , pulse was 80 and regular ,
BP was 140/50 , and respirations about 20. Mucous membranes were
moist and intact. Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to
light. Her sclerae were anicteric. Her conjunctivae were pale.
She had a 15-cm of JVD with 2+ carotids without bruits. Coarse
breath sounds bilaterally with crackles two-thirds of the way up
the bases. Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm with 2/6
holosystolic murmur. Her abdomen was obese , soft , nontender , and
nondistended. She had no clubbing , cyanosis , or palpable edema.
She has 1+ distal pulses noted.
Her EKG was normal sinus rhythm with ST depressions in the
inferolateral leads and a right bundle-branch block was present.
Her chest x-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
consistent with edema. So the patient was admitted to the
coronary care unit and a consult with Cardiovascular Surgery and
serial crits were performed. The patient's condition continued
to deteriorate. She developed respiratory distress. Anesthesia
was called and her airway was secured via an emergent intubation.
The patient subsequently developed signs of abdominal pain and
presumed sepsis and ischemic bowel. She was brought to the
operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. Status post an
exploratory laparotomy the patient had a complex course in the
surgical ICU where she underwent multi-organ system dysfunction.
Her prognosis was very dire. This was explained to the family
and on 7/12/05 at 2:20 a.m. the family decided to withdraw care ,
which will be consistent with both the patient and family's
wishes and desires , and the patient was pronounced dead at 2:24
a.m. on 7/12/05 .

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Hello Mr. Lockner , it was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in
the hospital. As you know , you were diagnosed with heart failure and
atrial fibrillation. We helped you by getting rid of some excess fluid
from your lungs , and slowed your heart rate down. We also started you on
an antiarrhythmic ( amiodarone ) to try to convert you into sinus rhythm.
After discharge please continue taking your amiodarone. Also please
following these instructions: 1. ) Weigh yourself daily ( your current
weight is 200 pounds ). If you gain significant weight , especially within
one or two days ( e.g. >3-5 pounds ) this may be fluid building up in your
lungs. Please call your doctor. 2. ) Please taking measures to stop
smoking. 3. ) Please check your blood sugar everyday in the morning before
breakfast and record these values for your doctor. 4. ) Please see an
opthalmologist within 1-2 months for a check-up. 5. ) Please take Lasix 80
mg twice a day. 6. ) Please continue taking ezetimibe and pravastatin for
your cholesterol control. 7. ) Please see your primary care doctor , your
renal doctor , and your heart doctor soon. 8. ) Please take 6 mg Coumadin a
night and get your INR checked at the Free Medical Center Coumadin clinic on 7/11/06 .
They will then instruct you to change your dose accordingly. Your goal
INR is 2-3.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
1. ) Cardiology -- consider electric cardioversion in 4-6 weeks if still
not in sinus rhythm on amiodarone. Please check LFTs , PFTs , TFTs ( last
value 10/15/06 nl )
2. ) Primary care -- titrate hypoglycemics -- consider switching from
glyburide to glipizide given renal dyxfxn?
3. ) Coumadin -- goal INR 2-3 to be managed at SBMH coumadin clinic.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 63 year old woman
with ischemic cardiomyopathy who now
presents with fever , malaise , and rigors. In April of 1991 the
patient suffered an anterolateral myocardial infarction and was
treated with TPA. She had recurrent chest pain five days later and
was retreated with TPA without improvement and then underwent PTCA
of her left anterior descending artery. The left ventriculogram at
that time revealed an ejection fraction of 20%. This myocardial
infarction was complicated by pericardial tamponade and hypotension
treated with pericardiocentesis. She also subsequent to this had
suffered recurrent episodes of congestive heart failure and
ventricular tachycardia. An echocardiogram at this time revealed a
significantly decreased ejection fraction with a new left
ventricular aneurysm and moderate mitral regurgitation. She was
evaluated for cardiac transplant but opted for Amiodarone and
aneurysmectomy/AICD implantation. In February of 1991 a cardiac
catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 18%. The patient
was seen in cardiomyopathy clinic on 1/18/95 and complained of
chills and weakness and subsequent urinalysis was consistent with
urinary tract infection. She was started on Bactrim p.o. Since
then she has had increased nausea and vomiting with three episodes
of falling and imbalance. She denies dizziness , lightheadedness ,
palpitations , or chest pain. She denies fever or chills although
she had rigors in the emergency room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Ischemic cardiomyopathy. Hypertension.
Increased cholesterol. Diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease status post anterior myocardial infarction
complicated by ventricular tachycardia and congestive heart
failure. Left ventricular aneurysmectomy. AICD placement. Status
post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy. Status post cholecystectomy and
appendectomy.
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin , Cardene , Digoxin , Synthroid , Zocor ,
Captopril , Lasix , K-Dur , vitamin C , insulin , and
magnesium.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for brother who suffered a myocardial
infarction at the age of 50. She does not smoke
and does not drink alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a well appearing woman in no apparent
distress. Temperature 101.2 , pulse 77 ,
blood pressure 102/52 , oxygen saturation 91% on room air. The
examination was notable for lungs that had faint bibasilar rales.
The heart examination showed a regular rate and rhythm with S1 and
S2 and 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border
radiating to the left lower sternal border. Abdomen: Soft and
nontender. No hepatosplenomegaly. Back: No costovertebral angle
tenderness. Rectal: Guaiac negative. Extremities: No clubbing ,
cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Admission laboratory data was unremarkable.
Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure
and no infiltrates. The ECG was unchanged compared with previous
ECGs. The urinalysis was notable for too numerous to count WBCs.
The urine culture showed Escherichia coli.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and started on IV
antibiotics , specifically Ampicillin and
Gentamycin. She was gently hydrated. Over the next several days
she continued to improve although she still felt moderately weak.
Her urine cultures grew an organism which was sensitive to
Ampicillin and she was discharged on p.o. Ampicillin to follow-up
with her primary cardiologist , Dr. Clement Wittig , to document
resolution of her symptoms and to return to normal state of health.

Discharge Date: 4/18/1999
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 70 year old female with a
history of coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus , and peripheral vascular
disease who is status post a PTCA/stent of obtuse marginal 1 in
July of 1990 which restenosed and required rotablation and
restenting in January of 1998 who presents now with unstable angina.
The patient had increasing chest pain over the past month
progressing to pain at rest. The patient presented with substernal
chest pain to the emergency room department with a blood pressure
of 230/90. The patient's blood pressure was controlled with IV
Lopressor and the patient was admitted for rule out myocardial
infarction. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on
5/18/99 which revealed the following: A stent restenosis of left
circumflex artery , a 60 percent left anterior descending artery
stenosis , a 70 percent diagonal ostial stenosis , a 40 percent
ostial right coronary artery stenosis , and 95 percent ostial
posterior descending artery stenosis. No myocardial infarction was
noted and ejection fraction was approximately 50 percent
calculated. The patient was subsequently scheduled for coronary
artery bypass graft.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease. Hypertension.
Congestive heart failure. Type II diabetes
mellitus requiring insulin. Peripheral vascular disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE: On 8/17/99 the patient was brought to the
operating room and underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft times three with a left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
After surgery the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit in stable condition. On postoperative day #1 the patient was
extubated without incident.
On postoperative day #2 the patient experienced a period of atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and rates in the
150s. The patient was treated with IV Lopressor and Diltiazem drip
at 10 mg/hr. The patient subsequently converted spontaneously to
normal sinus rhythm. Postoperatively the patient continued to
experience hypertension with systolic blood pressures ranging from
160s to 190s. The patient was started back on Lopressor and
Captopril and gradually increased to preoperative doses. The
patient was also started back on Amlodipine for further blood
pressure control. The patient continued to experience brief
episodes of atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion to
normal sinus rhythm. The patient was followed by her cardiologist
postoperatively , Dr. Grunow . The patient was started on
anticoagulation with Coumadin. The patient's atrial fibrillation
continued to decrease in frequency and duration and , at the time of
discharge , the patient had been in normal sinus rhythm for greater
than 24 hours. The patient was seen by physical therapy service
and it was felt that the patient would benefit from rehabilitation.

ATTENDING: BOYD ENOCH GROTELUESCHEN M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Dizziness , blurred vision.
LIST OF OTHER DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure , coronary
artery disease , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and glaucoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 56-year-old man
with known coronary disease , congestive heart failure , and
diabetes mellitus , presenting with an episode of weakness and
blurry vision. The patient had a recent admission at Doyle Health Care Services 7/20/04 through 10/17/04 with malignant
hypertension and CHF. At that time , he had 3+ lower extremity
edema , a BNP of 1374 , and an ejection fraction of 20%. On echo ,
he was diuresed and lost 10 kg of fluid and was discharged to
follow up with the CHF Service. Since that time , he has been
maintained on 60 mg p.o. of Lasix , recently increased to 60 mg
b.i.d. , also with some recent increases in his Toprol XL and
amlodipine. The patient presented to the emergency department on
the day of admission with an episode of weakness and blurred
vision. He states that he was at work helping set up for a party
and he became somewhat week. His vision blurred and this
resolved when he sat down to rest. He reports having had one
similar episode approximately one month ago , for which he did not
seek medical care. He had no chest pain , no palpitations , no
shortness of breath , no fever or chills at home and in the days
prior to the episode had had good appetite and no complaints of
dysuria.
In the emergency department , his vitals were temperature 97.1 ,
pulse 70 , and blood pressure 147/68. The patient was
comfortable. An EKG revealed a question of ST changes and it was
noted that his creatinine was increased to 2.1 from his baseline
of 1.4 and then his blood glucose was 307. He was admitted in
order to rule out myocardial infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , coronary artery disease ,
congestive heart failure , hypertension , cognitive deficits , and
glaucoma.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION: Amlodipine 7.5 mg ,
Timoptic 0.5 one drop OU q.d. , aspirin 81 mg q.d. , Imdur 120 mg
q.d. , Zestril 50 mg q.d. , Toprol XL 150 mg q.d. , Lasix 60 mg
b.i.d. , glipizide XL 10 mg q.d. , and atorvastatin 40 mg q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for the fact that the patient lives with
his mother and works at Ondo Carmi Medical Center Cafeteria.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for vitals as above.
The patient's jugular venous pulsations were visible at less than
10 cm. His heart was regular with S1 , S2 , S4 , and no murmurs.
His lungs had bibasilar crackles , right greater than left. His
abdomen was soft , nontender. No hepatosplenomegaly. His
extremities were notable for no edema. Scattered excoriations
with quite long nails.
LABS AT ADMISSION: Notable for a potassium of 5.3 , blood glucose
of 307 , creatinine of 2.1 , white blood count of 7 , and hematocrit
of 42. BNP was 118. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 62 , left
atrial enlargement , left ventricular hypertrophy , and T-wave
inversions with ST changes in I , II , and V1 through V5. Chest
x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient ruled out for MI. He had no
complaints of chest pain at any time during his admission.
Initially , his Lasix and lisinopril were held in the context of
concern over possible hypotension as an etiology of his episode
of weakness. However , these were restarted on the second
hospital day at slightly diminished doses compared to his
baseline.
2. Renal: The patient's creatinine improved and at the time of
discharge , it was back to his baseline of 1.5.
3. Endocrine: The patient's diabetes mellitus is very poorly
controlled. At present , his hemoglobin A1c measured at admission
was 11.4 indicating an average blood glucose level of greater
than 300. While in-house , he continued to receive his baseline
dose of glipizide XL , however , he was also covered with regular
insulin on a sliding scale. The patient has no prior history of
insulin use at home. After consideration of the risks and
benefits of other oral agents including the high nature of his
hemoglobin A1c , it was decided that insulin therapy would be
necessary for adequate control of his diabetes. Various concern
over the patient's ability to successfully manage insulin therapy
at home and so , a simply regimen was selected. To begin with , he
was discharged on standing dose of 6 units of NPH in the morning
and 6 units at bedtime to be given via a prefilled disposable
insulin pen that will involve no need to draw up the medication
himself , but simply to select the correct dose and give the
injection.
4. Neuro: The patient's episode of blurred vision did not
recur. It is possible that his hyperglycemia accounted for this.
He did have an ophthalmologic exam one week prior to admission
that revealed no problems. He had no other neurologic or visual
symptoms during his stay in the hospital.
5. Fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient was somewhat
hyperkalemic at admission with a potassium of 5.3. This resolved
with a single dose of Kayexalate and his potassium returned to
normal levels. The patient was discharged in stable condition on
6/19/04 .  To receive close followup , he will have visiting
nurses' visits including two visits the day after discharge in
order to assist with insulin management and he has an appointment
with his primary care physician , Dr. Clifford Evanko , the day after
discharge on 5/6/04 .

Discharge Date: 9/13/2006
ATTENDING: SPIOTTA , GERMAN M.D.
SERVICE: General Medical Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Aspiration pneumonia.
PROBLEMS: Diabetes , atrial fibrillation , CHF , acute renal
failure , thrombocytopenia , elevated LFTs , agitation , aspiration
and rheumatoid arthritis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Vinzant is a 71-year-old woman
with severe obesity who was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory
failure from a rehabilitation facility for rapid shallow
breathing. On arrival in the emergency department , she was hypoxic and
hypoglycemic , responding to fluids , intubation , and transfer to the MICU. She
was subsequently transferred
out of the medical ICU to the general medical floor. Of note , she had a recent
admission to Th Medical Center for sepsis secondary to
cellulitis and pneumonia , enjoying that admission she developed
ATN secondary to antibiotic use. ROS on arrival to the medicine floor is not
possible , as the patient is disoriented
( at baseline ). She does report low back pain ( chronic ) , is moaning at baseline
( secondary to stroke/aphasia ) , but appears in NAD.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD , for which she uses BiPAP at home and no oxygen.
2. CHF , secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Ejection fraction
is 55% with no wall motion abnormalities. She does have a
history of elevated pulmonary artery pressures of 57 above rate
reduction.
3. Obstructive sleep apnea with Pickwickian syndrome.
4. Hypertension.
5. Sick sinus syndrome , status post pacemaker implantation in
2000.
6. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
7. Angina , status post septal MI.
8. Hyperlipidemia.
9. Diabetes type 2 , recently increased to insulin while on
stress dose steroids at her last hospitalization.
10. Osteoporosis.
11. Rheumatoid arthritis.
12. GERD.
13. Cellulitis , with a recent pneumonia.
14. Thrombocytopenia.
15. Iron deficiency.
16. CVA in 1998 with expressive aphasia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Fluconazole , prednisone 20 mg p.o.
daily , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily , aspirin , atorvastatin , Imdur ,
Lasix , Norvasc , lisinopril , atenolol , Advair , DuoNebs ,
multivitamin , folate , calcium , Lispro sliding scale , NPH insulin ,
senna , Colace and oxycodone.
ALLERGIES: None.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband who is her
Healthcare Proxy.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature 99.1 , heart rate
69 , blood pressure 149/77 with an oxygen saturation of 99% on
100% nonrebreather. Morbidly obese. HEENT examination is significant for fixed
left pupil secondary to surgery , with a pinpoint right pupil.
JVP cannot be assessed secondary to obesity. Pulmonary exam is
significant for diffuse rhonchi with wheezing. Cardiovascular
examination significant for a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left
lower sternal border. Extremities reveal 2+ pitting edema with
2+ pulses.
LABORATORY STUDIES: On admission were significant for sodium of
149 , BUN of 49 , creatinine of 2.3 , glucose of 21 , white count of 13 , hematocrit
of 34 , platelets of 63 , 000 , an alkaline phosphatase of 284 , ALT
of 82 , total bilirubin of 4.0 , direct bilirubin of 2.0 , albumin
of 2.5 and an INR of 2.1. CXR reveals a RLL pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Aspiration pneumonia. The patient was admitted with a right
lower lobe pneumonia. She grew MRSA in her sputum and was
treated with vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl. She did well
and was extubated on her first hospital day after arriving in the
MICU. However , she continued to aspirate and failed a bedside
swallow study in the MICU. She was stabilized and transported to
the medicine floor on overnight BiPAP. She again failed bedside
swallow evaluation with thin liquids , and was therefore started
on a very conservative pudding thick puree diet. She did
subsequently aspirate on secretions ( she was not eating at that
time ) and became acutely hypoxic with an ABG that showed a pH of
7.45 , pCO2 of 48 and a PO2 of 36. Her family was brought in and
it was explained that the patient was recurrently aspirating and
was critically ill. A family meeting was held , where it was
decided that the patient would be DNR/DNI , and every attempt
would be made to bring the patient home with hospice. She
actually stabilized from her acute event and was able to wean
from BiPAP to 3 L oxygen nasal cannula. Nevertheless , the
patient's family understood that her respiratory status remained
tenuous and that she would likely re-aspirate. She was
discharged home with hospice services per family request.
2. CHF. The patient diuresed greater than 26 liters during this
admission. Much of this diuresis was without pharmacological
intervention , although she did receive minimal Lasix support. At
the time of discharge , she was tending towards euvolemic or dry and was
not on any Lasix. She was felt to be in the polyuric phase of
ATN , which was resolving.
3. Diabetes. The patient was discharged on insulin NPH and a
sliding scale regular insulin. Her doses have been decreased
because she was found to be hypoglycemic on admission.
4. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. Given the patient's history
of bleeding ( she had a GI bleeding while in the MICU in the
setting of an INR of 2.0 ) , Coumadin was held. On review with the
medical team , it was felt that the risk of stroke was far
outweighed by the risk of a significant bleed. Therefore , the
patient is not discharged on Coumadin.
5. Acute renal failure. The patient was treated with
antibiotics prior to this admission , and developed ATN secondary
to that medication. Of note , her urine was positive for
eosinophils on admission. At the time of discharge , the
patient's creatinine was 2.1 , which in part was due to ATN and
also due to significant diuresis. Her baseline creatinine is 1.7
and she is currently trending downwards.
6. Thrombocytopenia. The patient is noted to have a chronic
thrombocytopenia. This was exacerbated with heparin products ,
which were discontinued. She did require platelet transfusions
for a platelet count of 34 in the setting of acute bright red
blood per rectum. However , her platelet count was stable at
greater than 125 on discharge.
7. LFT abnormalities. A right upper quadrant ultrasound was
within normal limits , although was of poor quality given the
patient's obese body habitus. She does have a possible
cholestatic picture , but the patient had no other symptoms.
Given her DNR/DNI status with hospice services pending , no
further workup was performed.
8. Agitation. The patient is , at baseline , mourning and
disoriented , but responsive. She did require Haldol and Ativan
p.r.n. , but also did well with 1 to 1 interaction. Morphine was
adequate for pain control.
9. Speech and swallow evaluation. The patient failed several
speech and swallow evaluations. She is put on a pudding thick
puree diet , but this is palliative , as she will very likely
aspirate even on this diet.
10. Rheumatoid arthritis. The patient was continued on
prednisone 20 mg q.a.m.
DISCHARGE EXAMINATION: Temperature 96 , respiratory rate 22 ,
pulse 68 , blood pressure 130/60 , oxygen saturation 99% on 3
liters. Exam is notable for morbid obesity , coarse breath
sounds , right greater than left , large ecchymosis of varying
stages particularly at subcutaneous injection sites , and baseline
disorientation , which is not different from the patient's usual
mental status.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON DISCHARGE: White count 11 , hematocrit 33 ,
platelets 214 , 000 , glucose 134 , sodium 148 , chloride 111 , BUN 40
and creatinine 2.1.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg q.2 h. p.r.n. ,

Discharge Date: 1/10/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HYPEROSMOLAR STATE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Rule in myocardial infarction , diabetes ,
hypertension , congestive heart failure , and
urinary tract infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Sal Sult is a 65 year-old
woman with a history of hypertension ,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , with a history of urinary
tract infections who noted cloudy urine five days previous to
admission with increased frequency but no dysuria. In clinic three
days prior to admission , the patient had greater than 10 to the 5th
colonies of E. coli in her urine culture. Since that time , she
developed left back pain , temperature to 100.0 , chills , nausea , and
vomiting x24 hours.
The patient presented to her primary medical doctor on the day of
admission with a temperature of 98.2 , a blood pressure of 128/54 ,
pulse to 112 , and finger stick equal to 521 with a white blood cell

syncope , or palpitations. She also denied previous history of an
MI. The patient had had urinary tract infections previously
including an episode of pyelonephritis at age 7 , she denies a
history of kidney stones , she does take high doses of vitamin C.
Risk for coronary artery disease included age , family history ,
postmenopausal state , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and question
hypercholesterolemia. The patient had a positive stress test in
1997 , and was managed medically. She denied recent shortness of
breath or palpitations. Her last episode of chest pain was
reputedly one year previously , associated with stress of work and
for which she took nitroglycerin. She denied exertion related
chest pain but did admit to calf and ""hip"" pain with walking. She
denied buttock pain while walking. She denied previous history of

Sodium 135 , potassium 4 , chloride 97 , CO2 21 , BUN 29 , creatinine
1.6 , glucose 459. Acetest positive. White blood cell count 26.48 ,
hematocrit 41.3 , MCV 89.9 , platelets 278. White blood cell
differential with 81 polys , 13 bands , 4 lymphs , 2 monos. EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at 113 , axis equal to negative to 37 ,
intervals equal to 152/90/450 , as well as old Qs in V1 and V2 , left
anterior hemiblock , left ventricular hypertrophy. Chest x-ray
showed no infiltrate , no effusions , cardiomegaly , or pulmonary
edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's glucose came down quickly with IV
insulin and aggressive hydration. She
unfortunately ruled in for myocardial infarction with peak CK on
4/13/99 of 285 , and peak troponin of 6.15 for which she was
treated with beta blockers , aspirin , and heparin , as well as
Zestril and Zocor. She had some recurrent episodes of chest pain
during her admission following her non-Q wave myocardial
infarction.
She also had an echocardiogram on 4/13/99 which showed an ejection
fraction of 45% , and hypokinesis in the middle and distal
intraventricular septum. She had 1+ tricuspid regurgitation and
preserved right heart function.
On 1/12/99 , she underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a
40% osteo left main lesion and a 40% tapered distal lesion. Her
left anterior descending artery was diffusely diseased up to 50% in
its mid portion. The first diagonal had a discrete 70% stenosis ,
and the second diagonal had a discrete 90% stenosis. The right
coronary artery had a 40% discrete proximal stenosis , the posterior
descending artery had a osteo 90% stenosis. The right circumflex
had an 80% proximal stenosis.
The patient had an exercise stress test on 10/4/99 which was a
modified Bruce. The patient completed a 9 minute test with a
maximum heart rate of 100 , which was 65% of predicted. Her maximum
blood pressure was 156/60. She was asymptomatic with no ST changes
and remained in sinus rhythm. The test was therefore interpreted
as negative for ischemia.
It was thought that the patient would probably benefit from CABG
procedure but it was deferred secondary to patient preference , as
well as her infection. With regard to her infectious disease
issues , the patient was treated with levofloxacin. Her white blood
cell count was persistently elevated. She had one urine culture
which appeared contaminated and her blood cultures were negative
for this admission. She had a pelvic and abdominal CT on 2/1/99
which demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions , no evidence of
abscess , and punctate renal stones without evidence of obstructive
uropathy. Her fever resolved.
First it was thought that the patient did have a urinary tract
infection. She maintained relatively benign urinalysis , which was
collected only hours after she received ceftriaxone , it was
difficult to believe that she had ever had pyelonephritis. Because
of her persistently elevated white blood cell count was also
unclear although it did finally decline. In short , the series of
events that led up to her admission appeared likely to be urinary
tract infection leads to tachycardia and demand related myocardial
infarction , and then combination of infection and myocardial
infarction leads to nonhepatic hyperosmolar state. Nonetheless , a
different sequence of pathologies is also possible.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition.

observation unit on 6/2/06 in the AM. She diuresed well to 120mg iv
lasix x1. Evaluated by Dr. Steinhouse , her outpatient cardiologist.
Likely gradual CHF exacerbation due to increased salt in diet and change
in medications. She was not taking maxzide-25 and remained on lasix 80mg
po bid lasix. She will now need to increase her lasix to 120mg po bix x2
days , then take 120mg po QAM + 80mg po QPM from now on. Strict daily
weights and low salt <2gm diet.
2 ) RUE DVT: She was still receiving lovenox injections 100 daily , but
apparently was supposed to complete a 2 week total course in February
according to the medical records available. Dr. Lotthammer believed it was okay
for her to stop as she has been on lovenox for approximately 4-5 weeks.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath and failure to thrive.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 73-year-old gentleman with
end-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis , with ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% who was treated for C. difficile
colitis and worsening CHF. The patient has a long history of
ESRD secondary to hypertension and diabetes. He began
hemodialysis in January 2005. He also has a long history of
peripheral vascular disease status post right carotid
endarterectomy and bilateral external iliac angioplasty as well
as atrial fibrillation and a history of CVA diagnosed by MRI with
the timing unknown , thought to be secondary to thrombi from his
atrial fibrillation. This gentleman presented with worsening
shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion as well as worsening
dysphagia and anorexia on January , 2005. Apparently , he was in
good health or at least his usual state of health until April ,
2005 , when he was admitted to Aton Norran Rehabilitation Hospital Of for GU
symptoms which are unclear and a loss of appetite. He stayed
there for 30 days and then transferred to a rehabilitation
center. After being discharged there for 1 week , he developed
worsening shortness of breath and was unable to answer the door
when his neighbor knocked. The neighbor brought him into the ED
on January , 2005 , for acute shortness of breath , which the
patient described , has worsened over the past 3 to 4 days. He
has gone from being able to walk across his apartment to now only
being able to take 3 to 4 steps before becoming progressively
short of breath , and he now sleeps on three pillows. In fact , he
currently cannot even get through his HPI without 3- to 5-word
dyspnea. He denies any PND. Concerning for his dysphagia , he
feels like he first lost weight when he was trying to control his
volume status prior to hemodialysis initiation in early January
2005. His goal was to be 114 pounds and he limited his intake in
order to maintain that weight instead of limiting his volume.
About 2 months ago , he began losing his appetite. He states that
this was because of the ""his renal diet."" It was unclear if the
diet caused this loss of appetite or his loss of appetite was
prior to the diet. Over the past 3 weeks , he has noted
progressive difficulty in swallowing solid foods. He is able to
swallow liquids. Since discharge from rehabilitation a week
prior to admission , he is only able to take liquids. He quotes
he cannot even take noodles and soup. He has no nausea or
vomiting unless attempting to swallow solids and no abdominal
pain. His throat is sore and dry. He constantly wants water and
ice. Also concerning is the report , it is unclear , about a 20-
to 40-pound weight loss over the past 2 to 3 months. In the ED ,
he was afebrile; heart rate 105; blood pressure 136/70;
respirations 18; and 97% on room air. He was given Lopressor for
rate control for his atrial fibrillation. His EKG showed new T
wave inversions in the inferolateral leads and Q waves , which
were new for his baseline in the inferior leads. There was also
an S1 , Q3 , T3 , which was new but absent once his rate was
controlled.
The patient was admitted to the floor and briefly transferred to
the unit for refractory hypertension , though he was found to have
right subclavian stenosis and blood pressure was checked in the
left arm. His blood pressure was fine at 100 to 110 systolic.
He was then transferred back to the floor. An abdominal CT was
done on September , 2005 , which showed marked edematous colonic
wall beginning on the ascending colon all the way through to the
rectum. The differential diagnosis at this time was
pseudomembranous colitis versus ischemic bowel. His lactate
level was normal. He had a benign examination , and because of
the distribution and the past antibiotic use , it was felt that he
most likely had C. difficile , which was found to be culture
positive on August , 2005. He had an echocardiogram , which
revealed an EF of 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis and akinesis
as compared to an echocardiogram done at the outside hospital in
January 2005 with an EF of 30% to 35%. He had severe TR. On July , 2005 , while on hemodialysis , he had an episode of substernal
chest pain. Enzymes were sent and troponin peaked at 18. An EKG
showed ST depressions in V2 through V6 , which resolved with rate
control. He received aspirin and heparin and continued his
Lopressor and statin. The decision was made not to catheterize ,
as he was a poor candidate likely to have three-vessel disease
and not a surgical candidate. The patient made the decision with
the cardiologist , family , and the team. The patient was
scheduled for an EGD and colonscopy to evaluate his dysphagia and
colitis , but this was deferred secondary to the incident of the
non-ST-elevation MI on January , 2005. Subsequently , the patient
was managed medically for his worsening CHF and shortness of
breath with fluid removal at hemodialysis on Tuesdays , Thursdays ,
and Saturdays. The patient began Flagyl p.o. 500 mg t.i.d. on
January , 2005 , which should be continued through August ,
2005 , for a full 14-day course.
IMPRESSION: This is a 73-year-old man with acute worsening
shortness of breath in the setting of a 20-plus-pound weight
loss , increasing dysphagia , and progressive fatigue for the past
2 months. He was found to have Clostridium difficile colitis and
ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. His
course was complicated by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction
on January , 2005 , with a troponin peak of 18 , which was likely
demand ischemia from tachycardia in the congestive heart failure
setting. His EGD and colonscopy was postponed secondary to the
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The patient was managed
medically with fluid removal with hemodialysis for congestive
heart failure. He continues Flagyl p.o. for Clostridium
difficile treatment. He was transferred on July , 2005 , to a
rehabilitation facility.
PROBLEMS BY SYSTEMS:
1. Gastrointestinal: We are treating his C. difficile colitis
with p.o. Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. from January , 2005 , through
July , 2005. His stool did grow out Staphylococcus aureus ,
but this was likely from colonization from his mouth flora , and
therefore , we are not treating. Per ID consult , we are holding
all other antibiotics and treating only when cultures are
positive. He had a planned EGD and colonscopy , which was
postponed due to the NSTEMI on January , 2005. He should have a
scope done , both upper and lower , 2 to 3 months down the road
once the patient is stable. His LFTs were noted to bump on
July , 2005 , but now are trending down; that is likely
secondary to either shock liver or just his NSTEMI. Continue to
monitor them at rehabilitation. The patient is unable to swallow
solids and is currently on a full liquid diet. After EGD ,
consider barium swallow if nondiagnostic. The patient refuses NG
tube , so encourage p.o. intake. He will take Nepro if asked. He
should have at least 100 cc of Nepro a day.
2. Cardiovascular: CHF with an EF of 10% to 15% with global
hypokinesis compared to January 2005 EF of 30% to 35%. He has
severe MR and TR. He is on Lopressor 12.5 t.i.d. and captopril
12.5 t.i.d. with blood pressure tolerating well. He was started
on digoxin 0.25 three days a week on Sunday , Wednesday , and
Friday , and his current digoxin level is 0.9 on July , 2005.
He was wet on examination routinely and so it was taken off
between 1 to 3 liters at hemodialysis regularly. He had an
NSTEMI on January , 2005 , with troponin peak of 18 , likely demand
ischemia from CHF. Continue aspirin , beta-blocker , and statin.
We discontinued the heparin after 24 hours. A decision was made
not to catheterize , as he is a poor candidate likely to have
three-vessel disease. EKG currently shows Q waves inferiorly
with ST depressions in V3 through V4 and T wave inversions in V3
through V6. The depressions improved with rate control. He does
have a low blood pressure in the right upper extremity , which is
false due to a right subclavian stenosis; always check blood
pressures in the left arm. He has atrial fibrillation and he
used to be on diltiazem for rate control. He was on Lopressor
with good effect. He was restarted on his Coumadin dose at 4 mg
q.h.s. on July , 2005 , for anticoagulation. He is on
telemetry. He should be monitored of his INR for a goal INR of 2
to 3 for his atrial fibrillation and change of Coumadin as
accordingly.
3. Endocrine: Now on half-strength NovoLog sliding scale. He
has had trouble with hyperglycemia for the past several days.
His fingersticks can go up to 250. We think this is okay not to
cover , as when we choose to cover him , he dips down into the 40s.
4. Pulmonary: On admission , he had acute shortness of breath
and tachycardia. An EKG showed S1 , Q3 , T3. PE CT was negative.
There was no parenchymal disease. Some hilar lymph nodes were
noted. His repeated chest x-rays were every other day , which
only showed changes in the CHF status. There was routinely no
consolidation or interstitial disease seen. His last chest x-ray
showed bilateral pulmonary edema and that was on July , 2005.
5. Infectious Disease: We are only doing Flagyl p.o. for C.
difficile treatment. He should continue 500 mg t.i.d. p.o.
through August , 2005 , holding all other antibiotics. We
questioned if he is septic when his temperatures drop to 95 to
96 , but all blood , sputum , and urine cultures have been no growth
to date. You could consider a third generation cephalosporin if
a pneumonia develops.
6. Renal: Hemodialysis on Saturday , Tuesday , and Thursday.
7. Hematology: He has anemia. Panel workup with mixed picture
of iron and chronic anemia. We are repleting his iron with
vitamin C. He received 1 unit on October , 2005 , at
hemodialysis. His current hematocrit is 31. Guaiac stools have
been negative.
8. He has a malignancy workup , which has been negative so far.
He has a normal TSH , PSA , and free PSA. No mass is seen on
abdominal CT or chest CT.
9. Prophylaxis: He is on heparin subcutaneously and Nexium.
10. Disposition: He is going to rehabilitation today on February , 2005.
11. Code status: DNR/DNI.
12. Health care proxy: His brother , Son Gonzaliz ,
167-227-0450.
PLAN TO DO:
1. Hemodialysis on Tuesdays , Thursdays , and Saturdays.
2. Continue Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. from January , 2005 , to
August , 2005.
3. Follow INR for goal of 2 to 3 for atrial fibrillation , on
Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.h.s. currently.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.
headache; aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.; captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
t.i.d.; Peridex Mouthwash 0.12% b.i.d.; digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
every Sunday , Wednesday , and Friday; Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
t.i.d.; Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.; nystatin swish and swallow;
Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.p.m.; Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.; and Nexium 20
mg p.o. q.d. NovoLog sliding scale: If blood sugars are less
than 125 , give 0. Actually , give 0 until blood sugars are 251 to
300 , then give 2 units; 301 to 350 , give 4; and 351 to 400 , give
6. Also , ??___??.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: The patient was discharged , condition
stable.

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 57-yeare-old man with history of end-stage renal
disease , status post kidney transplant in 5/13 , aortic valve
replacement , coronary artery bypass graft , LIMA to LAD , in
7/7/005 , who is presenting here to the Otea Healthcare with worsening
lower extremity edema , shortness of breath , and decreased urine
output , and an increased creatinine from 3.3 the baseline to 5.3.
On admission , the patient did not report that the lower

edema as well as his lower extremity edema. He also described a
new shortness of breath on admission , a cough with whitish
sputum , no blood in his cough. He denied dyspnea on exertion ,
but did report being short of breath while lying flat , or
orthopnea. He did not describe any PND. He also reported a

before being presented to the emergency department. He also
described a decrease in his urine output one day prior to
admission and dysuria x2 days. The patient denied any nausea ,
vomiting , diarrhea , chest pain or pressure. No palpitations , and
no dyspnea on exertion.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Nexium 20 mg daily , Colace 100 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily ,
multivitamin , and tramadol 50 mg q.i.d.
ALLERGIES:
He reports no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
His temperature was 97.7 , his heart rate was 93-97 , his
respiratory rate was in the 30s , his blood pressure was 167/90 ,
and his O2 saturation was 97-99% on 2 liters. In general , he was
in fairly significant distress. He had difficulty catching his
breath. His head and neck exam is significant for equal , round
and reactive pupils. No cervical lymphedema , and no icterus.
His JVP was up to about 12 cm. He did not have any carotid
bruits. His cardiovascular exam was significant for rate and
rhythm that were regular at 2/6 systolic ejection murmur and
heard best in the right upper sternal border. He did not have S3
or S4. His chest incision was clean , dry and intact. His
pulmonary exam was significant for crackles bilaterally about a
halfway up his back. His abdomen was soft , nontender , and
nondistended , with positive bowel sounds. Incision of the
abdomen was similarly clean , dry and intact. His extremities
were significant for 3-4+ lower extremity edema , significant
pitting to the thighs , and some dependent decubitus edema as
well. He had 2+ pitting edema in his left upper extremity. He
had a fistula on his right arm. He has a decubitus sacral ulcer
with a VAC dressing in place on admission. Neurologic exam was
significant for alert and oriented x3. His cranial nerves were
all intact. He had no focal deficits.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: Status post CABG and AVR. On
admission , we held the patient's anticoagulation for a possible
biopsy of his kidney. We continued his Lopressor at b.i.d.
dosing. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction. He
had four-beat runs of NSVT on the day of admission , which he did
not repeat after repletion of his electrolytes. He had chest
pain again on hospital day #3 overnight. He did not have any EKG
changes with his chest. He was given Lopressor x1 , he ruled out
once again. The pain that he had developed was thought to be
likely incisional and not cardiac. Pulmonary exam: The patient
developed acute worsening of pulmonary status while in the
observation area at the emergency department on admission on
hospital day #1. He had an increasing O2 requirement , worsening
pulmonary exam , and a chest x-ray that showed pulmonary edema.
He was not diuresing effectively with more than 360 mg with IV
Lasix , which was administered to him in the emergency department ,
so Renal was called urgently to see him in observation and he was
sent for urgent dialysis. At dialysis , they removed greater than
4 liters of fluid and the patient was patient was symptomatically
improved. He did continue to have lower extremity edema
post-dialysis and an oxygen requirement of 2 liters nasal cannula
to maintain his oxygen saturation. He was given IV Lasix 80 mg
x1 on hospital day #4 with excellent urine output. His lower
extremity edema improved significantly after hospital day #4.
2. Renal: On admission , the patient's creatinine was 5.3. It
peaked at 6.6 and trended down to 5.1 with clear signs of
improvement. On admission , there was no improvement in his urine
output with large doses of IV Lasix , however , and Renal was
consulted to clarify whether this was an acute rejection versus
ATN from toxic doses of cyclosporin. In the emergency
department , he was given one dose of Solu-Medrol 500 mg , however ,
he was found to have elevated cyclosporin levels at 679 , so this
was thought to be the likely cause of his acute renal failure and
his cyclosporin was temporarily held. Since that time , on his
hospital day #1 , his cyclosporin levels trended down to the point
at which there were just slightly over 100 on hospital day #3 and
cyclosporin was reinitiated at lower doses. He was dialyzed on
admission with removal of 4 liters of fluid , CVM , BK , and LDH
were sent from dialysis. His creatinine improved , so further
dialysis and biopsy were deemed unnecessary.
3. ID status: The patient presented with UTI on admission.
This was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg x1 and then 250 mg
q.48h. for a course of seven days. Blood cultures grew 4/4
Gram-negative rods , and the patient was diagnosed with urosepsis.
After dialysis , the patient was treated with ceftriaxone 1 g
daily and continued on levofloxacin 250 mg q.4-8h. Transplant
and Infectious Disease was consulted who recommended ceftriaxone
be discontinued and the levofloxacin to be continued for two
weeks after discharge with repeat cultures. HSV swap from sacral
wound was sent. These repeat cultures and HSV swab were all
negative , and levofloxacin was continued for two weeks
postdischarge.
4. FEN: We held the patient's fluids. We checked his I's and
O's on a daily basis with daily weights. His hyperkalemia on
admission was 6.1 , resolved with Kayexalate , insulin and D50
meds. He was given additional Kayexalate when he came up to the
floor and his K resolved , backed down to his normal range. The
patient was kept on a renal and cardiac diet. His albumin and
total protein were low , so a nutritional consult was called ,
which optimized his nutritional status.
5. Endocrine: The patient had a tight glycemic control on NPH
16 units q.a.m. and 19 units q.p.m. , NovoLog 6 units q.a.c. with
sliding scale , and the patient's sacral decubitus ulcer had a VAC
dressing in place on admission. Plastics was called to address
his VAC. They took down the VAC due to some leakage on admission
and he was treated with 1/4 Dakin's solution and wet-to-dry
dressing t.i.d. On discharge , he continued on the wet-to-dry
dressings. He will be followed as an outpatient VNA , and will
have the VAC replaced by the VNA as an outpatient. His
hematocrit was stable throughout his hospital stay.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on Nexium throughout his
hospital stay and we held his anticoagulation for possible
biopsy. He will resume his outpatient anticoagulation and INR
checks with his INR Follow-Up Clinic. He was able to leave the
floor for cigarettes , and he signed an agreement suggesting that
he was going to tolerate the risk of leaving the floor for short
period of time even while on telemetry.
On discharge , his medications included calcitriol 0.25 mcg p.o.
daily , Colace 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin 16 units q.a.m. , 18
units q.p.m. , ketoconazole 200 mg daily , Lopressor 25 mg t.i.d. ,
prednisone 20 mg q.a.c. , cyclosporin 125 mg b.i.d. , tramadol 50
mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. for pain , Bactrim single strength one tablet
p.o. daily , CellCept 1000 mg b.i.d. , valacyclovir 500 mg daily ,
levofloxacin 250 p.o. every other day x2 weeks , NovoLog 6 units
q.a.c. , Neoral 125 mg b.i.d. , and aspirin 325 mg daily.
The patient was discharged to home in stale condition.

Discharge Date: 5/2/2001
CHIEF COMPLAINT: DYSPNEA ON EXERTION AND LOWER EXTREMITY SWELLING.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old male with
history of diabetes and ischemic
cardiomyopathy who presents on 11/26/01 with increased shortness of
breath and fatigue. His cardiac history began in 1980 , when he
suffered from an myocardial infarction and had a second myocardial
infarction in 1986. He had a 3 vessel coronary artery bypass graft
in 1987 with a LIMA-left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft
to OM and saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The patient developed
decreasing functional status postoperatively and recent
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15%.
In October 2000 , Mr. Straight was admitted to the Luke's Medical Center with chief complaint of dyspnea on exertion and
fatigue. Cardiac catheterization at that time showed native 3
vessel disease with occlusion of his venous graft to his obtuse
marginal and posterior descending arteries. On that admission , Mr.
Etling was aggressively diuresed and post discharge , he was able to
complete his normal activities of daily living with no shortness of
breath or chest pain. Over the several months prior to admission ,
however , Mr. Knoeppel noted progressive worsening of shortness of
breath , dyspnea on exertion and fatigue , such that , on the day of
admission , he reported that he could not walk from his driveway to
his house without symptoms. He reported no baseline orthopnea , but
states he does have paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
history of gallstones , hypothyroidism ,
nephrolithiasis , cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant only for the coronary artery
bypass graft in 1987.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of an myocardial infarction in his
50s. His mother also died of an myocardial
infarction in her 70s.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Captopril 37.5 t.i.d. 2. Isordil
30 t.i.d. 3. Digoxin .125 q. day. 4.
Synthroid .25 q. day. 5. Lipitor 20 q. day. 6. Torsemide 80
b.i.d. 7. Coumadin 4 mg Monday/Wednesday/Friday , 5 mg other days.
8. NPH 40 units b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature 97 , pulse 69 ,
blood pressure 100/70 , respiratory rate 16 ,
satting 92% on room air. Neck examination revealed jugular venous
pressure , elevated behind the ear and approximately 27 mm with
positive hepatojugular reflux. The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular examination revealed
regular rate and rhythm with frequent ectopy , positive S3 and PMI
in the midaxillary line. Abdomen was benign. Extremities showed
no lower extremity edema with 1+ distal pulses and warm to the
touch.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant for a sodium of 146 , BUN 16 ,
creatinine 1.3 , hematocrit 36 , INR 1.4.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 67 with left axis deviation ,
right bundle branch block and Q-waves in leads 2 , 3 and AVF.
Chest x-ray revealed no pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiology Ohio
service for diuresis and possible inotrope
support. He was diuresed over the course of 10 days using
Torsemide 80 mg IV t.i.d. and his Captopril was gradually increased
as tolerated to a maximum dose of 75 mg t.i.d. The patient
diuresed without difficulty and by the time of discharge , he had
weighed a dry weight of approximately 96 kilograms.
The patient was also evaluated for possible heart transplant.
Work-up was extensive and included an echocardiogram on 11/20/01 ,
which showed an ejection fraction of 15-20% with global hypokinesis
and akinesis of the inferior septal walls with moderate mitral
regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Abdominal
ultrasound on 11/20/01 , revealed probable cardiac cirrhosis. A
liver spleen scan on 10/1/01 , was consistent with mild cardiac
cirrhosis , as was an MRI of the liver on 4/24/01 .  As a result ,
the patient was not considered a candidate for transplant.
Pulmonary function tests on 4/10/01 , revealed a DLCO = 14 , which
was 49% of expected. On 3/20/01 , the patient underwent a
dobutamine MIBI stress test that was consistent with a moderately
enlarged area of prior myocardial infarction of the left circumflex
territory and posterior descending artery territories. The
examination was also suggestive with an area of modest dobutamine
induced ischemia in the territory of the left anterior descending
with preserved viability.
Endocrine wise , the patient's diabetes was managed in-house on a
regular insulin sliding scale. Because his hemoglobin A1C level
was below 6 on discharge , he was placed back on his regiment of NPH
40 units b.i.d. In terms of his thyroid , we made no adjustments to
his Levoxyl regiment. He has been coumadinized for a low ejection
fraction and was discharged on his regular regiment of 4 mg
Monday/Wednesday/Friday and 5 mg on all other days.
The patient also has a history of depression and he was maintained
on Prozac 20 mg q. day.
Hematologically , the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 36
during his hospitalization. His MCV = 75.1 in a 61-year-old male
with necrocytic anemia. We obtained a colonoscopy which revealed
polyps , all of which were snagged with no complications. The
pathologies are currently pending.
The patient was discharged on 7/15/01 , having diuresed to a dry
weight of 96 kilograms and plan to follow-up with Dr. Goltra on
7/30/01 .

Discharge Date: 5/30/2003
ADMIT DIAGNOSES: 1. HEART FAILURE.
2. DIABETES MELLITUS.
3. HISTORY OF CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT.
4. ASTHMA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year-old woman
with history of dilated cardiomyopathy
and estimated ejection fraction of 35 to 40% who presented with
lower extremity edema , weakness , fatigue , and syncopal episodes x
2. At baseline the patient states that she is able to walk and
perform her activities of daily living without symptoms of heart
failure. Per patient , about five days prior to admission , she
began to notice increasing lower extremity edema , rapidly spreading
from her calves up to her thighs. She also noted symptoms of
weakness and fatigue. On 9/29/03 the patient reported two syncopal
episodes- the first of which was preceded by dizziness after which
she lost consciousness after lying down. She awoke and walked to
her apartment where she apparently lost consciousness a second time
although she does not remember having any prodromal symptoms prior
to the second episode. The patient was found by her neighbor and
taken to the Niry Hospital .  At Labi Straubll Hospital ,
the patient was treated for heart failure with diuresis with IV
Lasix. An echocardiogram at the Malvfi Hospital showed an ejection
fraction of 10 to 15% , 4+ mitral regurgitation , 3+ tricuspid
regurgitation. The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction and
ECG showed no ischemic changes. The patient did have one run of
11-beat non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Liver function
tests were noted to be elevated. Her hepatitis panel was
reportedly negative. The patient was transferred from Got Center
to Towhiddle Amentcon Pal Medical Center as her primary care physician and
cardiologist are at Oten Memorial Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypotension. History of cerebrovascular
accident. Type II diabetes mellitus.
Asthma. Dilated cardiomyopathy.
MEDICATIONS: On transfer , Albuterol inhaler , Flovent inhalers ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Reglan 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals , Colace , iron , Captopril 50 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH 35 units q.a.m. and
q.p.m. , Humalog sliding scale , Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. , and
Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n.
LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 1.3. WBC normal. TSH was normal at
2.1 , ESR 8. ECG showed sinus rhythm , left atrial
enlargement , left ventricular hypertrophy , no ischemic changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular: The patient has a dilated
cardiomyopathy and was admitted with volume
overload. The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix throughout her
hospital course with successful diuresis of 1 to 2 liters of fluid
per day. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20 to
25% , severe global hypokinesis , moderate mitral regurgitation , and
moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Right and left heart
catheterization was performed. The right heart catheterization
showed the following: Right atrial pressure was 8 , right
ventricular pressure 35/5 , PA pressure 37/17 , and wedge pressure of
15. The left heart catheterization showed two vessel coronary
artery disease , no obstructive lesions. The patient showed marked
clinical improvement with diuresis with IV Lasix. Prior to
discharge the Lasix was changed from IV to p.o. and the patient was
stable on p.o. regimen of Lasix prior to discharge. The left heart
catheterization , as noted above showed moderate coronary artery
disease. The patient was continued on statin for this reason. The
patient had had two syncopal episodes prior to admission along with
a run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia at the outside
hospital. This raised the concern along with her low ejection
fraction that she could be having arrhythmias causing syncope. On
telemetry during this admission , the patient was noted to have
additional runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia along with
an episode of complete heart block. The electrophysiology service
was consulted and placed an ICD and pacer on 11/25/03 .  This
procedure was well tolerated.
Renal: The patient was noted to have low albumin on admission and
protein in her urine , concerning for nephrotic syndrome. Renal
consult was obtained. The 24-hour urine was collected. Renal
ultrasound was negative for hydrosis or renal vein thrombosis. An
SPEP and UPEP were sent which are pending at the time of this
dictation. The renal consult felt that the diabetes mellitus was
the likely explanation for the protein wasting in the urine. The
patient was continued on an Ace inhibitor.
Infectious disease: The patient was noted to have a localized area
of infection at the area of old IV site on admission. She was
started on p.o. dicloxacillin to treat this infection. Surgery was
consulted and ruled out septic thrombophlebitis.
Hematology: The patient was taken off Coumadin on admission but
was continued on heparin for anticoagulation. The Coumadin was
restarted after the pacer and ICD were placed.
Endocrine: The patient was treated on a regimen of Lentes and
insulin sliding scale. Her blood sugars were stable on this
regimen.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient will planned to
be discharged on the following medications:
Dicloxacillin 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.hs. , Lentes 40
units subcu q.hs. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , and Keflex 25 mg p.o. q.i.d.
FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr.
Avary . She will follow-up with her cardiologist , Dr. Dobies , on
3/3/03 .  She will have a repeat echocardiogram in July to
reassess her ejection fraction and valvular disease.

Discharge Date: 4/22/2003
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 67-year-old man with a
history of coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass grafting , mitral valve
replacement with previous history of endocarditis in April 2002
who presents with severe back pain. The patient was well until
Friday before admission when he drove 2 1/2 hours to Coln As Las
and he had some back stiffness. The following day the patient
noted back pain , took some Tylenol but remained ""stiff all day"".
On the following day , Sunday , he appeared better , able to tolerate
walking well. On Monday he again had severe pain , came to the
emergency department here at Ux Erla A Hospital where he
had a CT of the spine and chest without evidence of abnormalities.
He was discharged to home with Percocet. On the morning of
admission the patient was again with pain. He was urged by his
cardiologist to come to the emergency department to rule out
epidural abscess , work up for cause of back pain. He was negative
for any fever or chills. No bowel or bladder incontinence. No
radiation of pain down the legs.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative except for HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.0 , heart rate 78 , blood
pressure 160/80 , respiratory rate 20 , satting 95% on
room air. GENERAL: The patient was sitting in the stretcher ,
comfortable but with pain upon movement. HEENT: Pupils are equal
and reactive to light. Mucous membranes moist. Oropharynx is
clear. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm with a mechanical
S1 and S2. PULMONARY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with
trace bibasilar crackles. ABDOMEN: Obese , nontender ,
nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Warm and well
perfused. 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Intact.
Lower extremities limited by pain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass grafting , status
post myocardial infarction , mitral valve replacement with a St.
Jude valve , congestive heart failure , history of endocarditis ,
history of hypercholesterolemia , status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Amiodarone 200 mg q day , digoxin 0.125
mg q day , Imdur 30 mg q day , Captopril
50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Toprol 50 mg q day , Lipitor 80 mg q day ,
Coumadin 3 mg po q day , Levoxine 75 mg q day , Lasix p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife.
FAMILY HISTORY: Non-contributory.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for a white blood cell count
of 11.17 , hematocrit of 44.6 ,
platelet count of 129 , with 27 lymphocytes , 55 neutrophils , D-dimer
278.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 67-year-old male with a history of mitral valve
replacement complaining of severe back pain with
Streptococcus endocarditis in 2002 admitted of thoracic back pain
for four days. The pain progressed to the point where the patient
had difficulty ambulating secondary to the pain. CT scan of the
thoracic and lumbar spine on May , 2003 were negative for
abscess. The patient had no fevers. His admission exam was benign
with no aortic insufficiency and normal neurological exam. There
was variable pain to palpation over the ribs with no pain to
palpation over the spine. The patient was managed conservatively
with Oxycodone , Motrin and Baclofen. He was initially admitted to
GMS , and troponin was initially positive at 0.12 and then became
negative.
1. Infectious disease: Blood cultures drawn on March , 2003
grew 2/2 bottles of gram positive cocci in clusters and pairs. Due
to concern for prosthetic valve endocarditis or potential epidural
abscess , the patient was transferred to cardiology. Infectious
disease consult was obtained. Vancomycin and gentamicin were
started on March , 2003. On October , 2003 a transesophageal
echocardiogram was negative for vegetation. A MRI of the spine was
negative for osteomyelitis , epidural abscess however the MRI did
show severe degenerative joint disease possibly causing the
patient's back pain. The patient has had numerous positive blood
cultures for Streptococcus sanguous ( Viridans group ) , blood
cultures were last positive on March , 2003 with a negative work
up including a negative transthoracic echocardiogram and negative
transesophageal echocardiogram , negative chest CT x 2 , negative
abdominal CT ( which did show a small liver cyst ) , negative tagged
white blood cell count scan and a negative back MRI. Dental
consult saw no abscesses thus no evidence of a large septic source
from the mouth although this particular bacteria raises suspicion
for an oral source. Repeat films and dental evaluation on November , 2003 required the patient to get teeth cleaning as an
outpatient. There is a question of some seeding from bleeding gums
that occur about once weekly while the patient is brushing from
poor dentition and gum care. The dentist recommended deep cleaning
as an outpatient with prophylactic antibiotics. the patient was
initially started on gentamicin , vancomycin , on October , 2003
switched to gentamicin and penicillin. He will complete a 2 week
course of gentamicin and penicillin G on November , 2003. At that time
on August , 2003 the patient should start a 4-week course of
ceftriaxone 1 gram q day. PICC line was placed on August , 2003
to provide long term access for antibiotics.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was continued on Toprol , Imdur ,
switched from Captopril to Lisinopril. Rhythm: The patient was on
amniocentesis , digoxin , Coumadin for St. Jude valve and paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. CT and MRI is negative. Pain significantly
improved on January , 2003. The patient was on Neurontin and
OxyContin and oxycodone and Motrin , may benefit from restarting on
Baclofen if pain not well controlled on this regimen or persists
outside the treatment of endocarditis.
3. Endocrine: Continue on Synthroid.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: Insurance does not cover home
antibiotics so the patient will be
discharged to a skilled nursing facility for intravenous
antibiotics likely to the O Hospital on August ,
2003.
TO DO PLAN:
1. Follow the patient's INR closely while on Motrin and
antibiotics , in the past when on antibiotics his INR has been
difficult to control , goal range for the patient should be
around 2.8 to 3.5 and his Coumadin was increased from 3-4 mg
on August , 2003 given that his INR was trending downward to
2.0 on January , 2003.
2. Complete a 14-day course of penicillin G , gentamicin on November ,
2003 then complete additional four seeks of ceftriaxone
starting on August , 2003 to be completed on July , 2003.
3. The pain is likely secondary at least partially to
degenerative joint disease with some contribution possibly
from an infectious source but unlikely. Should titrate the
pain medications down as tolerated.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q day , digoxin
0.125 mg p.o. q day , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Motrin 400-600 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. for back or
musculoskeletal pain take with food , Synthroid 75 mcg p.o. q day ,
oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q 4-6h p.r.n. pain hold if somnolent or
respiratory rate less than 12 , Senna tablets two tablets p.o.
b.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q day , Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q day , Imdur
30 mg p.o. q day , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. q day , Prilosec 40 mg p.o. q
day , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q day , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
gentamicin sulfate 110 mg IV q 12h x six days , penicillin G 3
million units IV q 4h x six days , Ceftriaxone not to be started
until August , 2003 for 28 day course ending July , 2003 1000 mg
intravenously q day , OxyContin 30 mg p.o. q 12h x seven days.
FOLLOW UP: The patient should follow up with Dr. Jefferey Mero ,
cardiologist at Blackci Medical Center who knows
the patient well and who also will follow his INR levels once
discharged from the rehabilitation center.

Hospital Course.
( 1 ) CV: The patient was admitted with dyspnea and chest pain. On exam ,
he was in volume overload with episodic atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response. At time of admission , he admitted to recent
dietary indiscretions. Of note , his digoxin level at time of admission
was also less than assay , suggesting medication noncompliance. He was
ruled out for MI by serial ECG and enzymes. His dyspnea/chest pain was
associated with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and
improved with rate control and diuresis. He was digoxin loaded and
aggressively diuresed to a weight of 140.7 kg. On day of discharge ,
his breathing was back to baseline and he appeared euvolemic by exam.
He will be discharged on coumadin for his atrial fibrillation/history
of PE. As his INR was 1.9 at time of discharge , he will not be
discharge on a lovenox bridge but will need to follow-up in 2 days for
an INR check. He will follow-up with Dr. Youmans , Dr. Elke ( his new
PCP ) , and the cardiology anticoagulation service.
( 2 ) PSYCH: The TM team was consulted for his nicotene addiction and
made referrals for him to the smoking cessation program at the Johour Memorial Hospital .
Pyschiatry was consulted , and they recommended resuming celexa. In
addition , he was sent up to see a psychiatric social worker for
counseling.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please call your primary care doctor if you should develop worsening
shortness of breath or weight gain.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable

Urinalysis was pending. EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 123 ,
positive PVCs , left axis deviation , nonspecific T wave inversion
AVL , V5 , V6. Chest x-ray showed a very dilated heart , prominent
hila , increased PVR , no effusions. AICD lead seen in right
ventricle.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1. Congestive heart failure. The patient has
clear evidence of left and right systolic
dysfunction. Patient with known cardiomyopathy , may have had
worsening of function with recent viral upper respiratory
infection. No clear dietary indiscretions. Begin Lasix drip ,
strict Is and Os , daily weights , low salt diet , cardiac monitor ,
check echo. 2. Abdominal pain. May have food poisoning on
Sunday. Also may have gastritis or pancreatitis. Right upper
quadrant pain may be secondary to congestive heart failure.
3. History of hypothyroidism. Check TSH.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiomyopathy service , Dr. Jim Gerardot ,
attending , began following patient on the first
hospital day. It was felt that the Lasix drip was ineffective and
recommended starting 200 mg IV Lasix t.i.d. with the goal of
keeping the patient 1.5 to 2.5 liters negative per day. The
patient had difficulty with repletion of potassium during the
entire hospital stay. Patient does not tolerate well either the
immediate release oral form of potassium or the IV form. The IV
form hurts the IV site and the oral form makes him nauseous , but he
still prefers the oral form. Over the course of the admission , 10
mg p.o. twice daily of slow released potassium was started and ,
eventually , was 30 mg twice daily at the end of his stay.
Captopril was added to the regimen at 12.5 mg three times a day on
the second hospital day and was eventually raised to 50 mg three
times a day as his blood pressure tolerated , which took four days.
Creatinine remained stable throughout admission and did not affect
our ability to diurese with Lasix. After six days , the patient was
adequately diuresed. JVP was now not visible. Lungs were clear.
There was no edema. The patient is tolerating captopril well.
Coumadin , which had been 4 mg per day on admission , was cut to 2 mg
per day because of the high INR on admission. Two days prior to
discharge , INR fell to 1.9. Patient was restarted on 4 mg per day.
At discharge , INR was 1.7. Patient does not wish to stay to have
INR corrected. VNA has been arranged to administer Lovenox and to
check PT , PTT over the next few days until this normalizes to a
therapeutic level.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.125
mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 160 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.d. , Compazine 10
mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea.
Patient is being discharged home with VNA services. He will follow
up with Dr. Scottie Fowles on 11 of May at 9:20 A.M.

Discharge Date: 10/16/2004
ATTENDING: MILFORD WIZWER M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 36-year-old man with a history of a familial
cardiomyopathy , ejection fraction estimated at around 15% with
marked left and right chamber enlargement , severe mitral
regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and PA pressures of 51
plus right atrium , as per an echo in 2003. He was also status
post ICD placement in 2001. At baseline , he has a one staircase
exercise tolerance before becoming short of breath. He also
admits that he has been having increasing orthopnea and
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He denies , chest pain ,
palpitations , or peripheral edema. He also has a history of
dietary fluid intake and medications noncompliance leading to
heart failure exacerbations. Currently , he states that he has
been eating ""salty foods , "" and has been drinking a lot of extra
fluids because he has been feeling dry and is not always taking
his medications. Consequently , he has noticed a worsening in his
exercise tolerance , worsening orthopnea , and most notably an
increase in abdominal girth. Because of these symptoms
consistent with decompensated heart failure , his physicians
suggested that he be admitted to the hospital for management of
his decompensated heart failure. Of note , he has been previously
on a transplant list , but has been delisted given his
noncompliance and continuation of tobacco use.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
In addition to the cardiomyopathy is chronic renal insufficiency
with the creatinine ranging from 1.2 to 3.5 at times.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Aldactone 25 mg once a day , K-Dur 40 mEq once a day , lisinopril
2.5 mg once a day , Isordil 20 mg three times a day , digoxin 0.125
once a day , torsemide 200 mg twice , and metolazone p.r.n. for
volume overload.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
As mentioned , he is smoking one-half per day of cigarettes ,
occasional alcohol use , no IV drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY:
His mother , his brother , and his cousin and nephew all have the
familial cardiomyopathy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On the day of admission , he presented with the JVP in the 18 to
20 range on the physical examination with positive HJR. His
cardiac exam had a positive S3 of laterally displaced PMI with
the right ventricular heave. He also had a 2/6 systolic murmur.
His abdomen was distended , nontender , but likely with ascites and
palpable liver edge. His extremities were warm without edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
From the cardiac standpoint , we initially attempted to diurese
him IV torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. However , he did not respond well
enough to this regimen , and therefore we started drip with
Zaroxolyn p.r.n. We also stopped his Isordil and ACE inhibitor
early on because of blood pressures in the 80s. On admission ,
his creatinine was 2.0 and on the next day of admission , it was
2.2 with low blood pressures , at which point , we decided to start
a low-dose dopamine drips at 2 mcg per hour. However , his urine
output was only about 500 cc negative , so we further increased
the Lasix drip from 10 mg an hour to 20 mg an hour after 200 mg
IV Lasix bolus. On this combination of the Lasix drip at 20 an
hour and dopamine at 2 mcg per hour , he began to have very good
and effective urine output at approximately 2-3 liters per day ,
negative , also reflected in his total weight , and came in with
admission weight of around 90 kg. On each day , he diuresed about
an half to kilo off until the day of discharge , at which point ,
he was less than 86 kg. We monitored strict I's and O's , checked
daily weight. During the course of his diuresis , his sodium
levels were decreasing mostly secondary to the patient drinking a
lot of free water. The combination of free water intake in the
setting of natriuresis resulted in further worsening of his
hyponatremia from an admission sodium of 128 to 124 , eventually
to 122. We strictly reinforce the need to limit his fluid intake
to less than 2 liters per day , and at that point , his sodium
levels than rebounded to 124 and also 128 on the day of
discharge. We monitored the b.i.d. lytes. Eventually , his blood
pressures remained stable. His JVP decreased from 18 to 20 on
admission to about 10 to 12 and continued to have good urine
output , thus we weaned off the dopamine , but continued the Lasix
drip for one more day. We then discontinued the Lasix drip and
transitioned him back over to torsemide 200 b.i.d. p.o. , which
was his home regimen and watch him for another 24 hours. He
continued to diurese at this dose , but then on the day of
discharge , his I's and O's were finally about 500 cc negative ,
which is a change from about 1 to 2 liters negative per day. His
JVP was about 9 to 10 and his creatinine was stable at 1.7. We
re-added his Isordil at 10 mg t.i.d. for the last 24 hours and
his blood pressures were stable in the 90s. Given his potassium ,
which was always borderline low in the 33 or 35 range , we decided
to increase his Aldactone dose to 25 mg b.i.d. , but given his
underlying renal insufficiency , we have decreased his standing
K-Dur from 40 mEq a day to 20 mEq a day. An echo was done , which
showed an ejection fraction of 20% and 4+ MR. They did not
comment on the synchrony on the preliminary report. However , he
is a candidate for Bi-V pacing given his mildly widened QRS
complex stage III heart failure and having been on a very good
heart failure regimen up until this point.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
At discharge , his medical regimen consisted of digoxin 0.125 mg
once a day , torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. , Aldactone 25 mg b.i.d. ,
Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , and K-Dur 20 mEq. We also added folate 5
mg to his regimen because he had an elevated homocystine level.
He also takes Ambien at night p.r.n. for insomnia.
DISPOSITION:
He is being discharged to home with plan to follow up with Dr.
Grassi in her Thyroid Clinic on 3/1/05 .  He has been again urged
to stop smoking and to be complaint with his regimen because he
is a good heart transplant candidate and for the current time , he
is not listed given the aforementioned reasons. Overall , Mr.
Plagmann states that his symptoms have drastically improved. He
no longer has orthopnea. He is able to exert himself much more
without symptoms of shortness of breath or lightheadedness , and
he is eager to go home

Discharge Date: 9/21/1998
SERVICE: Lesta Memorial Hospital .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Myocardial infarction. 2. Non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus. 3. Chronic renal insufficiency. 4.
History of renal carcinoma.
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES: 1. Cardiac catheterization on August , 1998.
2. A stress mibi with viability study on May , 1998. 3.
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty on July , 1998.
BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of
a 35 to 40 pack year smoking , and non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus for 14 years. The patient has been waking with occasional
shortness of breath over the preceding three weeks , and having
chest pressure lasting 30 seconds to a minute that resolves
spontaneously. The night prior to admission , the patient woke from
sleep with severe dyspnea , chest pressure , and diaphoresis. He
denied any nausea , pain , or radiation of his symptoms. The
paramedics were called and the patient was noted to have an oxygen
saturation of 70 to 80 percent on room air. He was intubated in
the field and taken to Tlwake University Hospital .  The initial
electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations in V1 to V3 , with T wave
inversions in V3 through V6. He was treated with tPA at Enle Hospital .  He was treated with intravenous Lasix for presumed
congestive heart failure and hypertension , and was admitted to the
Cardiac Care Unit. He was placed on nitroglycerin drip which was
titrated to his blood pressure. He was successfully extubated the
following morning. He was started on metoprolol , digoxin ,
lisinopril , and a heparin drip. He underwent an echocardiogram
which showed an ejection fraction of 25 percent with global
hypokinesis. He remained pain-free throughout his hospitalization ,
and had no further episodes of dyspnea. He was transferred to the
Wadl Uhump Medical Center on February , 1998 for further management of
his myocardial infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. History of renal carcinoma status post
nephrectomy in 1994. 2. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3. Mild hypercholesterolemia which is not currently being treated.
4. Renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy with a baseline
creatinine of 2.0.
MEDICATIONS: Glyburide. At Andsto Eredja Healthcare : 1. Heparin. 2.
Aspirin. 3. Insulin sliding scale. 4. Lisinopril. 5.
Furosemide. 6. Zocor. 7. Lopressor. 8. Digoxin. 9. Pepcid.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 35 to 40 pack year history of tobacco.
He rarely drinks alcohol , and denies any drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , overweight man in
no acute distress. Vital signs: The patient had a temperature of
98.4 , heart rate 77 , blood pressure 143/78 , respirations 18 , and
oxygen saturation of 91 percent on three liters by nasal cannula.
HEENT examination showed pupils that were equal , round , and
reactive to light and accommodation. Conjunctiva were anicteric.
Extraocular movements are intact , and his oropharynx was clear.
Neck examination was supple with his jugular venous pressure at
approximately 8.0 centimeters. There was no lymphadenopathy.
Chest examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally , with no
rales. Heart examination was regular rate and rhythm with a
non-displaced PMI and a positive S3. There was no murmur.
Abdominal examination showed an obese , soft abdomen with positive
bowel sounds. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. No
masses were palpated. The extremities were warm with no edema. He
had 1+ femoral pulses bilaterally. His left lower extremity had a
1+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. His right lower
extremity had a 1+ dorsalis pedis pulse with a nonpalpable
posterior tibial pulse. Neurological examination , he was alert and
oriented x three. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 are intact and
symmetric. He had 5/5 strength throughout. Deep tendon reflexes
were 2+ throughout with downgoing toes bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies from Ter Memorial Hospital showed a sodium
of 139 , potassium of 4.5 , chloride 109 , CO2 of 21 , BUN of 22 , and
creatinine of 2.2. Glucose was 236. Liver function tests were
within normal limits with an alkaline phosphatase of 95 , total
bilirubin of 0.4 , and AST of 39. CPKs were 151 , 163 , and 163 with
no MB fractions done. His TnI was less than 0.2 to 0.3. He had a
white count of 14.2 with a hematocrit of 42.9 and platelets of 222.
His triglycerides were elevated at 303 , and his cholesterol was
elevated at 265 with an HDL fraction of 32 and an LDL fraction of
172. His prothrombin time was 11.3 , partial thromboplastin time
28.4 , and INR 0.85. Urinalysis was negative. An electrocardiogram
was performed at the time of admission which showed resolution of
the ST elevations. He had T wave inversions in V2 through V4 , and
flat T waves in V5 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1. Myocardial Infarction: He was
continued on a heparin drip , Lopressor , and lisinopril. His
digoxin was discontinued at the time of admission. Nitroglycerin
was given only p.r.n. He remained symptom-free throughout his
hospitalization. His elevated cholesterol was treated. He
underwent cardiac catheterization on July , 1998 which showed 50
percent left main obstruction and 90 percent complex mid left
anterior descending. His right coronary artery was occluded. The
patient did well both during and after the catheterization. The
patient underwent a stress mibi test with a viability study on January , 1998 which showed ischemia during his exercise tolerance test.
The mibi showed severe ischemia in 11/25 segments , as well as an
infarct on the apical septum , apex , and base of the inferior wall.
Options were considered including coronary artery bypass grafting
and angioplasty. After a long discussion with the Cardiology
Service , Cardiac Surgery , the Renal Service and the patient , the
decision was made to proceed with angioplasty. On July , 1998 ,
the patient underwent a percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of his right coronary artery with zero percent residual
blockage. He also had two stents into his left anterior descending
with zero percent residual blockage. The patient tolerated the
procedure well.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma for
which he underwent a nephrectomy in 1994. He also has chronic
renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy. As surgery was being
considered for his cardiac disease , a Renal consultation was
obtained to evaluate his renal status. He underwent a renal
ultrasound showing an exophytic mass in his solitary kidney. This
was very concerning for recurrence of carcinoma. He then underwent
an MRI study which showed a nonenhancing mass in the kidney which
was most consistent with a hyperdense , proteinaceous cyst. This
was reassuring , though cancer could not be ruled out 100 percent.
The patient's renal function remained stable throughout his
hospitalization.
3. Non-insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was
placed on an insulin sliding scale during his hospitalization. He
was instructed to continue with his Glyburide , and to follow-up as
usual with his outpatient provider.
The patient was discharged to home on October , 1998 , one day
following his second catheterization procedure. The patient did
very well following the procedure , and had remained pain and
dyspnea-free.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: 1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d. 2. Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Lopressor 12.5 mg
p.o. three times per day. 4. Nitroglycerin 1/150 sublingual
tablets , one sublingually every five minutes x three as needed for
chest pain. 5. Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6. Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
q.h.s. 7. Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 8. Ticlid 250 mg p.o.
b.i.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient was instructed to follow-up with his
primary care physician , and to call the office to schedule an
appointment. The necessary follow-up with Cardiology and with the
nephrologist will be scheduled as an outpatient.

Discharge Date: 1/1/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
3. URINARY TRACT INFECTION.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70-year-old woman who
was followed in cardiology by
Dr. Pikula who has presumed diastolic dysfunction , who was in her
usual state of health until 1/23 , when she was admitted to the Dobubay Naicent University Of Medical Center with a flare of Crohn's ileitis.
At the time of her discharge , she was not restarted on her Lasix
and subsequently developed fluid retention with gradual worsening ,
shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. The patient noted a
20 lb weight gain during this period , as well as increasing
orthopnea and increasing dyspnea on exertion when getting dressed
or doing any different movements. She was seen in cardiology
clinic on 8/3/02 and found to be in much worse congestive heart
failure with new atrial fibrillation. She was transferred then to
the emergency department here at the Peresvillee Nawvine University Of Hospitals And Clinics .
Her most recent echocardiogram on 4/29/01 revealed mild to
moderate left ventricular hypertrophy without any regional wall
motion abnormalities. Her systolic ejection fraction was estimated
to be 60% suggesting a diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction and heart
failure. She was admitted with volume overload for diuresis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The review of symptoms was notable for chest
tightness with occasional palpitations. She
experienced no dizziness , no syncope and no recent diarrhea , no
abdominal pain , no nausea or vomiting. She did report chronic
arthritis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Significant for congestive heart failure
due to diastolic dysfunction , ( 2 ) Crohn's
colitis diagnosed in 1963 , ( 3 ) Right breast carcinoma stage II
previously treated , not currently active , ( 4 ) Diabetes mellitus ,
( 5 ) Obstructive sleep apnea , ( 6 ) Gastroesophageal reflux disease ,
( 7 ) Hypercholesterolemia , ( 8 ) Osteoarthritis.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a prior tobacco smoker , having
smoked two packs per day for 38 years , but has
quit. She does not drink alcohol and does not use any recreational
drugs. The patient lives in Di with a friend and is a retired
x-ray technician.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ALLERGIES: The patient's medical allergies include penicillin ,
which causes a rash , Demerol and Dilaudid causing
nausea , and Macrodantin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Included a temperature of 97 ,
heart rate 76 , blood pressure 90/60 ,
respiratory rate 28 , and a saturation of 97% on room air. The
patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation. GENERAL: Physical
examination showed that the patient was alert and oriented x3 , in
no acute distress , having shortness of breath while sitting up in
bed. HEENT: Normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , round , and
reactive , extraocular movements were intact. NECK: Showed jugular
venous distention to at least 20 cm. CHEST: Showed crackles
posteriorly approximately half of the way up. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Showed an irregular rhythm and a systolic ejection murmur
consistent with the prior diagnosis of aortic stenosis. ABDOMEN:
Showed profound obesity. EXTREMITIES: Showed significant pitting
edema bilaterally over the calves.
LABORATORY DATA: Showed a white blood cell count of 7 , hematocrit
31 , platelets of 148. Sodium was 142 , potassium
3.9 , BUN 56 , creatinine 1.3 , with a glucose of 75. Liver function
tests were normal. CK was 44 and troponin was 0.02. A chest x-ray
showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion without any evidence of
infiltrates. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 72 ,
otherwise no abnormalities beside some nonspecific ST-T wave
changes. Urinalysis showed evidence of an urinary tract infection
with 20-30 white blood cells and was leukocyte esterase positive.
Urine culture was sent at that time.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Congestive heart failure - The patient was
started on IV Lasix along with Zaroxolyn and
responded with a brisk diuresis over the course of the admission.
The patient's weight declined by approximately 5.2 kg. It was
estimated that the total volume of fluid removed was approximately
15 liters. The patient was reported great improvement in her
symptoms , was able to ambulate without requiring supplemental
oxygen. The patient was switched to oral Lasix and continued her
diuresis. The day prior to discharge , the patient was switched to
oral torsemide , and she will be discharged on that medication.
2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient was noted to have new onset
of atrial fibrillation while being seen in cardiology clinic on
8/3/02 . Since it was not known how long the atrial fibrillation
had been going on , a decision was made to anticoagulate the
patient. She was initially started on intravenous unfractionated
heparin while starting anticoagulation with Coumadin. The patient
reached a therapeutic INR of 2.5 within approximately 4-5 days and
the IV heparin was discontinued. At the time of discharge , the
patient INR was 3.2. She will have INR follow up through her
primary cardiologist , Dr. Janousek . Currently , the decision to
cardiovert the patient is left in the hands of her outpatient
cardiologist.
3. Urinary tract infection - The patient's initial urinalysis
indicated a bacterial urinary tract infection. Subsequent urine
culture grew out E. coli , which was subsequently determined to be
resistant to levofloxacin. Initially , the patient had been started
on IV levofloxacin , which was subsequently changed to p.o.
cefixime. The patient completed a five-day course of p.o. cefixime
while here in the hospital and was discharged on that medicine to
complete a 10-day course. Of note , the initial symptoms the
patient had including hematuria , resolved by the time of discharge.
4. Diabetes mellitus - The patient has a long history of diabetes
requiring insulin treatment. She is followed by endocrinologist at
the Kingnix Lowemar W.kell Medical Center .  During this hospitalization , her
blood sugars were maintained with insulin subcutaneous injections.
The patient is to continue the management of her diabetes per her
endocrinologist.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: chest pain
---
HPI:This is a 63 year-old female with history of CAD s/p MI and PCI
( stent to D1; see cardiac anatomy below ) , HTN , DM , hypercholesterolemia ,
obesity. She was last in her usual state of health approximately 1
month ago when she developed a ""head cold"" that has been marked by
frequent coughing and SOB/DOE. Her appetite has been quite poor , and she
reports occasional dizziness. She has been taking her diuretics
faithfully and has been making her usual UOP. She has not been using her
CPAP recently due to her head cold.
She awoke this morning feeling as if she were being choked. She reports
coughing quite violently and bringing up grayish/yellowish sputum
( no blood ). After her coughing spell , she became quite nauseated but
cannot remember if she threw up. She also developed some diffuse
chest tightness that lasted for approximately 10 minutes ,
associated with subjective fevers and diaphoresis. She returned to
sleep , but this time sitting up in her sofa. She reports that she has
been coughing throughout the day with 1 additional fleeting
episode of chest tightness this evening. She was CP-free upon
evaluation in the ED.
Of note , her presenting symptom during her NSTEMI back in '02 was low
back pain.

Review of Systems: As above. She further denies weight gain/loss , LE
edema , orthopnea , diarrhea , constipation , abdominal pain.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV: Started on IV Heparin and Lipitor dose increased to 80mg. Cont'd
b-blocker and full dose aspirin. Pt was free of CP upon admission and
throughout admission. EKG remained at baseline abnormal but showed no
overt ischemic changes. Her first set of enzymes revealed a slightly
elevated CK 371 w/MB fraction of 3.7 , but all three troponins were
negative. Although her story was not convincing for ACS , her TIMI score=4
( known CAD , more than 2 episodes in last 24 h , previous ASA use , 3
cardiac RF's of HTN , DM , CHOL ).
MIBI nondiagnostic b/c of obesity. Pt did not tolerate cardiac PET on
8/17 , b/c of anxiety/claustraphobia , then refused to have study w/IVCS.
Given the fact that pt ruled out for MI , and that pain did not recur ,
team suspects CP may be related to cough ( M/S and/or pleuritic in
etiology ) and no further inpt CAD workup was pursued. Pt to f/u w/her
cardiologist 11/3 .
2. RENAL: new ARF likely secondary to taking home lasix in setting of
poor PO's , Cr improved to 1.4 after holding Cozaar and diuretics and
giving IVF. Pt instructed to restart Lasix and Cozaar on 7/18 .  Pt will
be followed by KOOTE HEALTH .  Wt upon admit=not recorded , wt upon d/c=258lbs.
3. PULM: Stable O2 sat and exercise tolerance on day of d/c. Sputum cx
grew mixed flora. Cont'd Advair , Albuterol , restarted nocturnal CPAP.
Tessalon ordered PRN.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: ATTN PATIENT:
1. if you develop recurrence of chest pain , worsening cough , difficulty
breathing , fever >101 , or any other symptoms that are worrisome to you
call your PCP or return to the ER for re-eval.
2. Keep records of your weight and blood sugars and bring the record to
your follow up appointments.
3. Bring your medications to your f/u cardiology appt for review by your
doctor.
ATTN VNA:
1. please reconcile home meds as pt was unable to clarify her pre-admit
meds during this admit and pt is essentially being discharged home on the
medications that were in the AMH computer system. if there are any
discrepancies w/available home meds in comparison to d/c med list then
notify pt's PCP.
2. daily CV and Pulm assessment ( including daily weights )
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
ATTN CARDIOLOGY: During f/u eval can you please review daily wts
and check a creatinine. Decide if diuretics and/or Cozaar needs
adjustment.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 5/30/05 and taken
to the operating room where he underwent a heart transplant and
excision of HeartMate LVAD without complication. For further
details , please see the dictated operative note. The patient was
on bypass for 200 minutes with cross clamp time of 77 minutes.
He left the operating room with one atrial wire , one ventricular
wire , three pair of cardio tubes ( Blake drains ) , and two right
pleural tubes ( Blake drains ). AICD was excised from left
clavicular space and a Blake drain was left in the pacer pocket.
The patient was admitted to the Tiesdea Rellla Memorial Hospital ICU on discharge from
the operating room. The patient was extubated on the evening of
postop day 0 without complications. He was brought up on
epinephrine , milrinone , dopamine , vasopressin , insulin , and
propofol drips.
ICU COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Neuro: The patient was extubated early on postop day 1 and
propofol was turned off on arrival to the ICU. The patient was
given Dilaudid IV initially for pain , converted to p.o. Dilaudid.
He was also started on Zoloft on postop day 2 at 75 mg p.o.
daily for his anxiety. He is relatively anxious but his pain has
been well controlled with Dilaudid. He will leave the ICU on
Dilaudid p.o. p.r.n. pain.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was brought up from the
operating room on epinephrine , milrinone , dopamine , and
vasopressin drips. All drips were continued from postop day 1 to
postop day 2. The patient's cardiac output and index were stable
and his next venous saturations were stable in the 70s on this
combination. Epinephrine was weaned slowly from postop days 2-3.
It was off by postop day 4. Dopamine and vasopressin were also
weaned from postop day 4-5. Hemodynamics remained stable.
Milrinone was decreased to 0.4 from 0.5 on postop day 6. The
patient will leave the ICU on postop day 6 and milrinone per Dr.
Kridler will be weaned at 0.1 per day. The patient has been
hemodynamically stable from a cardiovascular standpoint since
arrival from the operating room. He was started on aspirin 81
daily. Swan was removed prior to discharge from the intensive
care unit on postop day 5 , 11/4/05 .
3. Pulmonary: The patient was extubated early on postop day 1
without complications. The patient remained very wet secondary
to the amount of fluid and products he received in the operating
room. The patient was started on a Lasix drip on postop day 1 ,
which was continued for a goal urine output of 200 to 300 cc an
hours. Patient with negative 3-4 liters in 24 hours over the
postop days 2-5. Lasix was discontinued on postop day 5 prior to
transfer from the ICU as patient had been diuresing a large
amount and creatinine had risen slightly up to 2.1 from 1.5
preoperatively. Urine output will continue to be monitored with
a goal of negative overall fluid balance , as patient remains wet
on chest x-ray.
4. GI: The patient's diet was advanced as tolerated. He is
currently eating a regular low-fat , low-cholesterol diet and is
on Nexium. He also remains on vitamins , folate , Colace , and
lactulose. He has still not had a bowel movement prior to
discharge from the intensive care unit.
5. Renal: The patient was aggressively diuresed beginning on
postop day 1 with a Lasix drip. The Lasix drip was adjusted for
a goal urine output of 200 to 300 cc an hour for several days.
Drip was turned off on postop day 4 for a short period and again
on postop day 5 as urine output remained stable at greater than
200 an hour. Lasix drip is off on postop day 5 prior to transfer
from the intensive care unit. The patient will continue to need
diuresis since he is still wet on chest x-ray. The patient's
creatine has bumped , however , from 1.5 to 2.1 at this point.
6. Endocrine: The patient was weaned from his insulin drip on
postop day 5. He was continued on the Portland protocol during
his time in the ICU as sugars were greater than 150. The patient
was started on postop day 2 on prednisone 35 p.o. b.i.d. , Neoral
75 mg p.o. b.i.d. , which was since increased to 100. At the time
of discharge , patient remained on prednisone 35 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Neoral 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and CellCept 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. per
the transplant team. Cyclosporin levels were followed and doses
were adjusted as needed.
7. Heme: The patient was started on aspirin beginning on postop
day 1. Aspirin is 81 mg p.o. daily.
8. ID: The patient received vancomycin for his chest tube
prophylaxis. Chest tubes removed on 7/18/05 , postop day 4.
Vanco was discontinued after this. Bactrim was also started on
postop day 1 for PCP prophylaxis and Valcyte was started several
days later as the donor heart was CMV positive.
Additional discharge medications and instructions will be
dictated by the PA on the floor when the patient is discharge
home.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: In short , Ms. Wesley Antonopoulos is a
55-year-old woman with a long history of nonischemic dialytic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 30% , resting tachycardia , diabetes
type 2 , tubal ligation , obesity status post stomach stapling at
VHMC with acute decompensation for three weeks , abdominal bloating
and fatigue , status post systemic stapling but that was years
prior and now , has had a decompensation of heart failure for
three weeks , abdominal bloating and fatigue. Of note , she is on
clinical trial with implanted PA catheter placed in 2001. She
was seen in the heart failure clinic with systolic blood
pressures of 90 , baselines 110s-120s and baseline heart rate of
100s. She was admitted for diuresis and possible transplant work
up. The patient was unaware of the transplant plans at that
time.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient on exam was afebrile , heart
rate in the 90s , blood pressure 110/80 , 100% on room air , JVP of
13 , clear chest , regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 , obese
abdomen , liver edge 4 cm below right costal margin , warm and well
perfused with 1+ edema , 2+ DP pulses.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Pumpwise , she is unclear trigger for compensation but low ACS
probably at that time. Had diuresed greater than 11 liters on
Lasix drip , Zaroxolyn and dobutamine at 2. Towards the end of
the hospitalization , even if slightly negative , she was changed
to torsemide p.o. Echo read no effusion and an EF of 15%
thrombus versus veg on device. Patient has implanted device
which measures p.o. pressures , again from the clinical trial. We
continued her ACE inhibitor , no beta-blocker given though poor
tolerance. She has continued on that. She had a right heart
cath on 2/12/04 showing very high SVR. Discharge was status
post steroid therapy , off nipride and dobutamine , transplant work
up was nearly complete. She was weaned off nipride with
captopril. Her goal event is slightly negative and patient
seemed to be doing very well.
B. Ischemia wise , she had no evidence for ACF and was not ruled
out for MI.
C. Rhythm-wise , normal sinus rhythm. On tele , she had some PVCs
and nonsustained VT. Caution for ectopy , given dobutamine drip
but no ectopy was seen.
2. ID-wise. PICC was placed on 3/6/04 and Cortef was dc'd.
3. Endocrine-wise. Patient's diabetes , she was on glipizide and
Regular insulin sliding scale. We started Lantus and this was
dc'd as an outpatient. The patient will follow up with her
primary care doctor to better control her diabetes.
4. FEN: The patient is on cardiac and diabetic diet with fluid
restriction and salt restriction and on a multivitamin.
5. Heme-wise: She was on heparin for thrombus with a PTT goal
of 60-80. She was started on a Coumadin bridge on 3/6/04 and
sent home with Lovenox shots. Her INR was thought to be followed
up by her primary care doctor and Rudolf Tretheway . She lives in
An , so they will both follow up.
6. Musculoskeletal: She is on probenecid for gout status post
Decadron and taper for a gout flare that worsened.
7. Psych-wise: She has depression and anxiety. She is on
Advair and Celexa.
8. Renal-wise: Her creatinine improved from 2 to 1.4 status
post dc of Cozaar and colchicine till 1.1 , I believe , on the day
of discharge.
FOLLOW-UP PLAN: The patient was following up again with Dr.
Wuerth and also with Marc Balck within two weeks of her
discharge , also following up with her Coumadin Clinic to allow a
close follow of her INR given anticoagulation for the device she
has in place.

18. HISTORY OF MEDICAL NONADHERENCE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old African-
American gentleman with a complicated
medical history including severe alcoholism and coronary artery
disease , congestive heart failure who has at baseline had shortness
of breath , dyspnea on exertion and at times paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea also orthopnea. He has a history of medical nonadherence ,
noncompliance. The patient presented four days prior to admission
on 10 of February to his primary care physician Dr. Dubrey with a cough
chills , but no fever , myalgias , pleuritic chest pain and weight
loss of 9 lb , from 167 to 158 in three months with increased
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The patient had not been taking his
congestive heart failure/cardiac medications for at least one week.
A chest x-ray at that time was negative for pneumonia but was
suggestive congestive heart failure. He was also diagnosed with a
probably URI. His congestive heart failure medications were
refilled. A PPD was placed at that time. The patient was not
getting antibiotics.
The patient developed progressive malaise , anorexia , was unable to
get out of bed , poor p.o. He denied any increased alcohol abuse at
that time. There was no abdominal pain per the patient's
girlfriend but there were complaints that the patient's mental
status was worsening. He was more lethargic and was found mumbling
by his girlfriend with increased shortness of breath and EMTs were
called who found the patient to be somewhat somnolent but arousable
with a blood glucose of 483 , blood pressure 110 /palp. He was
transferred to the Tabell Aleretsentla Medical Center emergency room.
The emergency room he was alert and oriented times two with
temperature of 89 rectally , blood pressure 120/68 , respiratory rate
28 , O2 of 100% on 100% face mask. An arterial blood gases pH was
7.13 , pO2 326 , pCO2 28. Acetest was positive. Betahydroxy
butyrate of 1.66. serum glucose was negative at 1800 with an anion
gap of 27 , serum sodium 129 , serum potassium 7.6 , BUN 178 and a
creatinine 7.5. The patient was treated with one liter of normal
saline IV over five hours , 20 units of IV insulin two amps of
bicarb , 30 grams of Kayexalate , one amp of calcium gluconate ,
Solu-Cortef 100 mg , ceftriaxone two grams IV. The patient's mental
status markedly improved after the hydration. The patient was then
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for treatment
evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Please see problem list above. Also of
note , the patient has a history of severe
alcoholism , denies any preadmission alcohol binges at that time;
but , later admitted to drinking of one to two gallons of gin and
vodka at a time with his friends and also drinking many beers. At
baseline , the patient has some shortness of breath , dyspnea on
exertion , orthopnea and at times paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. His
last echo previously the one done on this admission was in 11/27
which showed an ejection fraction of approximately 30% with
anteroseptal HK , posterior lateral HK , inferior AK , 1+ MR and AR
and an ETT MIBI in 5 of August showed IMI , ischemia. However , an echo
repeated during this admission showed an approximate ejection
fraction of 50% with inferior and septal HK only and mild aortic
insufficiency and mitral regurgitation .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs - Temperature 94.0 , pulse 78 ,
and regular , blood pressure 100/66 , O2 is
100% saturation on 100% facemask. Respiratory rate 28. In
general , the patient was responsive to voice and oriented to
En Hospital , and said 1997. Head , eyes , ears ,
nose and throat exam showed that he was anicteric. Extraocular
movements are intact. Pupils are equal , round , reactive to light , 2
mm. Oropharynx was dry. There was no jugular venous distention
and low lymphadenopathy. The neck was supple. Lungs - Had few
bibasilar crackles , greater on the right. Cardiovascular - Regular
rate and rhythm with positive ectopy , no murmur , regurg or gallop.
His abdomen was soft , diffusely tender , mildly distended with
positive bowel sounds with no liver edge palpated. He was heme
negative in the emergency room with no rebound. Extremities -
Trace edema bilaterally and were somewhat cool. His skin had no
petechiae , no rash and no splinters. Neurological - He was able to
move all extremities. His reflexes were 2 in the upper and lower
extremities except for the left ankle which was 1 and his right
ankle was 0. His left toe was downgoing. His right toe was
equivocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant for a WBC of 11 , hematocrit was
normal at 43 , platelets 160. Significant for
bandemia of 14 , 81 polys , INR 1.3 , SMA-7 was significant for a
serum sodium of 129 , potassium 7.6 , chloride of 91 , bicarb of 11 ,

troponion-I was 0. Lipase was 22 , 610 , amylase was 2840. Liver
function tests were within normal limits , ALT of 11 , AST of 10 , LDH
174 , alk phos of 11 , T-bili of 0.4 , albumin of 3.5 , calcium 9.3.
Phos was elevated at 12.8 , magnesium was elevated at 5.2. UA was

level was 0.8 , tox screen was negative. UA - had 0-1 wbcs , SG of
1.023.
EKG showed ventricular pacing at a rate of 77.
Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrates or effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for further treatment evaluation of his
severe metabolic abnormalities. He also by labs he had a
significant severe pancreatitis and was felt to be either a DKA or
HHNKA. An endocrine consult was obtained and they felt that the
patient was likely not in DKA as the patient's level of
betahydroxybutyrate of 1.66 was not enought to explain the
patient's gap or all his metabolic disturbances. The endocrine
service that more likely the patient had hyperglycemic ,
hyperosmolar , nonketotic acidosis and also severe pancreatitis.
Initial screens for the cause of pancreatitis were negative
including stones. The patient has significant alcohol history and
has been drinking alcohol which is the most likely cause of his
severe pancreatic insufficiency. The patient was aggressively
hydrated with IV fluids and his metabolic abnormalities began to
correct. He was also noted by labs to be in acute renal failure
and a renal consult was obtained. The patient's nonoliguric renal
failure was in the setting of severe dehydration secondary to
hyperosmolar state and ACE inhibitors were felt most likely due to
ATN. A renal ultrasound performed on 1 of July showed no evidence of
gallstones or biliary duct dilatation.
An abdominal CT performed on 7 of July showed grade I pancreatitis with
no evidence of a pseudocyst. The patient's clinical course was
complicated by rhabdomyolysis which was felt to be due to a
hypophosphatemic state , but this was not completely clear as the
patient's CKs began to rise while the patient's phosphate was still
secondary to the acute renal failure. The patient's CKs peaked
around 10 , 000 and then began to fall steadily and the patient's
renal function with continued hydration improved steadily as his
creatinine and BUN returned to normal. However , in the night of
20 of June the patient's abdominal pain worsened and there was a
question of peritoneal signs which prompted an emergent exploratory
laparotomy to rule out abdominal ischemia. However , the findings
were not consistent with ischemic bowel , but only severe
pancreatitis was noted. On 25 of July and 20 of June the patient did very well
postoperatively back in the Medical Intensive Care Unit. He was
started on TPN and with a slow wean of his of dextrose , his blood
sugars normalized. On 20 of June the patient's renal function had also
normalized. The patient by 5 of September had marked decreased abdominal
pain , normalized electrolytes and his renal function was at his
baseline with a creatinine of 1.0.
The patient was transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit
to our service on 8 of May on TPN and the following medications:
1. Digoxin 0.375 mg q.d.
2. Carafate one gram b.i.d.
3. Albuterol two puffs t.i.d.
4. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
He is also on TPN , but was being advanced to a clear liquid diet
and seemed to be tolerating it well. He also continued to require
a large amount of insulin through his TPN and also through his
sliding scale. The patient did well and was able to tolerate a
clear liquid diet and was advanced in the next two days to a soft ,
solid diet with very low fat.
I will dictate the rest of the patient's events , assessment and
plan by problem list as follows:
1. GI:
I. SEVERE PANCREATITIS: The patient was able to be advanced
to a soft solid diet for the past few days. She has abdominal pain
which had almost resolved and then resumed and the patient
developed a watery diarrhea. It was felt that this could be due to
pancreatic insufficiency versus C. diff colitis and therefore C.
diff samples were sent and the patient was presumptively started on
Flagyl and Pancrease 12 , 000 units t.i.d. 1/2 hour before meals.
The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea persisted. This prompted
us to make the patient n.p.o. once more and another abdominal CT
was obtained. An abdominal CT performed on 30 of March showed
progression of pancreatitis with increase inflammatory changes.
There was no necrosis or pseudocyst formation noted. Also noted
was some significant small bowel dilatation without any evidence of
obstruction. Therefore , the patient was continued to be kept
n.p.o. and TPN was restarted on 25 of April .  The patient has tolerated
this well and at this time has no longer had any abdominal pain
either subjectively or on exam. It does occasionally have mild low
back pain which is thought to actually be due to his pancreatitis
as opposed to any musculoskeletal cause.
II. DIARRHEA: The patient also had diarrhea as noted above.
He has been worked up extensively. His diarrhea has now resolved.
He was C. diff negative , but was treated presumptively with Flagyl
for seven days. All stool studies including Shigella , Salmonella ,
Campylobacter , ova and parasites , Microsporidia have been negative.
His stool has been sent for quantitative fecal fast which is still
pending on discharge. He has been repeatedly guaiac negative. As
noted above his diarrhea has resolved.
III. RESOLVED HEME POSITIVITY: The patient earlier in the
course of his Intensive Care Unit stay had some stools that were
heme positive. They were thought to be due to gastritis. He has
now been on initially , after that has been on Prilosec and now
changed over to ranitidine in his TPN and has had multiple guaiac
negative stools in the past ten days.
IV. SMALL PERIANAL ULCER: The patient was noted to have a
small perianal ulcer. It is felt to be secondary to pressure from
lying in bed and also secondary to his multiple episodes of
diarrhea which had been going on for days. It is felt that this
should resolve. If it does not , it is suggested that the ulcer be
swabbed and sent for HSV.
2. ENDOCRINE:
I. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS: Due to the patient's
pancreatic insufficiency , the patient will be a life long diabetic.
The patient has been followed by the endocrine service and is now
receiving 45 units of insulin per liter through his TPN. He is
also on a sliding scale regular regimen with finger stick q6h. It
is felt that this should be a relatively stable regimen for him at
this time. As the patient is weaned off his TPN and starts to take
p.o. again , he should be switched over to NPH b.i.d. with regular
insulin checks on a sliding scale before his meals. The patient
also has a follow-up appointment with the diabetes clinic in three
weeks as noted below.
3. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient does have a history of congestive
heart failure and has had mild bi-basilar crackles throughout his
stay here. This has not limited him in any way. He has had a good
oxygen saturations. The patient continues to take 40 mg of Lasix
p.o. q.d. On the day of discharge , he received an extra 20 mg IV
as he has been I&Os positive for the last few days and we noted a
slightly more crackles on his exam. Of note , the patient has a
long history of having paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but had been
doing relatively well here. His current medical regimen includes
Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. Both of
these can be titrated upwards as his blood pressure allows. He has
had some labile blood pressures ranging anywhere from the systolics
of 80s to 130s while in the hospital and he has never been
symptomatic and even when he has been , he has had blood pressures
in the 80s and has tolerated this well. He is also maintained on
digoxin 0.375 mg q.d. He is also taking aspirin for his cardiac
regimen.
4. PULMONARY: The patient had good O2 saturations and usually
ranging from 95 to 97% on room air and has had no pulmonary
problems. He has had bibasilar crackles on exam which is felt to
be due to some mild congestive heart failure for which he is taking
Lasix. He may need some extra doses of Lasix per your directions
the next few days.
5. HEME: The patient's hematocrit has been low in the high 20s on
two occasions. In both cases always drifting down slowly thought
to be due to delutional effects plus repeat a phlebotomy. He has
been transfused a total of three units while he has been in the
hospital here. Otherwise is hematocrit has been stable for
multiple days so has his platelets. Also of note the patient has
been heme negative from below for more than ten days.
6. RENAL: The patient says his baseline creatinine in which his
acute renal failure has resolved.
7. RHABDOMYOLYSIS: This has also resolved with the patient's CKs
having normalized over a week ago.
8. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient has remained afebrile , normal
white count for many days. While here he was also presumptively
treated for C. diff which was actually found to be negative on his
stool examinations with no fecal leukocytes. The patient's
temperature curve should be followed given that the patient
continues to have pancreatitis and is at risk for developing a
phlegmon.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. SEVERE PANCREATITIS: The patient continues to be on TPN. A
PICC line has been placed and a triple lumen catheter will be
removed prior to transfer of the patient. It is our feeling that
the patient should remain on TPN for the next two days and then as
per your directions , the patient could be slowly advanced on a p.o.
diet as tolerated. We feel that the patient deserves another trial
to see if he can tolerate p.o. before any long term decisions is
made regarding his nutrition and perhaps placement of a J-tube for
long term feeding. The patient's amylase and lipase on the day of
discharge are 47 for amylase and 166 for lipase. These values
continue to remain low even when the patient was having abdominal
pain. This is felt to be due to a relatively burnt out pancreas.
A GI consult was also obtained which agrees with this assessment.
It is felt that when the patient does start taking p.o. again he
should have pancreas at least 8 to 12 , 000 units t.i.d. half hour
before meals due to his pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Also
the patient should be followed clinically very closely including
his white count , fever curve and his abdominal exam for any signs
and symptoms of development of an infection or phlegmon or
pseudocyst because of his pancreatitis. The patient's TPN should
be continued as noted below.
2. ENDOCRINE INSUFFICIENCY: The patient , as noted above , will
require insulin , both through is TPN and his fingersticks should be
checked every six hours. As noted when the patient is switched
over to a p.o. regimen , we suggest per endocrine recommendations
that NPH be given b.i.d. and the patient should be covered with an
insulin sliding scale at bedtime.
The patient is being transferred to Redist Nalereamer Memorial Hospital on
2 of April in good condition. The patient today denies any abdominal
pain , nausea or vomiting , but occasionally continues to have mild
back pain. His diarrhea has resolved. He is afebrile with a blood
pressure of 120/70 , pulse is 69 , respiratory rate 16 , sat 97 on
room air , with a weight of 69.0 kg. He is comfortable and has had
bibasilar crackles of 1/4 the way up. His abdomen is soft ,
nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds. His
extremities are without edema.
On the day of discharge his white count is 8.8 , hematocrit is 36 ,
ADDplatelets of 348. His SMA-7 was within normal limits with a
creatinine of 0.6. His amylase is 47 and his lipase is 160.
DISPOSITION: The patient is being discharged in good condition
to Lakesfic Hospital Medical Center .  His primary care
physician Dr. Littmann is aware of the patient's discharge and will
continue to follow with his care. The patient also has an
appointment with Dr. Sanislo in the Diabetes Clinic at Longa Ent No on 7 of January at 11 a.m.

CARDIAC SURGERY CONSULT: CURT O. MAULDING , M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: 1. CARDIOMYOPATHY OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY.
2. RETROSTERNAL CHEST PAIN FOR RULE OUT
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
3. NONINSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
4. HISTORY OF PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Mrs. Troy Burrus is a 54-year-old woman from Ston Chandseu Sa with a background history of idiopathic
cardiomyopathy and noninsulin-dependent diabetes , and pulmonary
tuberculosis who presented with an 20 minute episode of chest pain
and dyspnea for a rule out myocardial infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is remarkable for 1 ) A
cardiomyopathy of 10 years' duration of
unknown etiology. The patient denies alcohol abuse. There is no
history of rheumatic fevers in childhood. There is no valvular
defects , and has no known risk factors for coronary artery disease ,
aside from her noninsulin-dependent diabetes. The etiology at this
point is thought to be viral. The patient experiences intermittent
episodes of mild chest pain and chest pressure with exertion
approximately one episode every 2-3 months and is not currently on
sublingual nitrates. She has no known coronary artery disease and
has not had a myocardial infarction. 2 ) Noninsulin-dependent
diabetes times three years , well controlled on Glucotrol 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and diabetic diet. She has no known diabetic retinopathy ,
nephropathy or peripheral neuropathy. 3 ) The patient has a history
of tuberculosis approximately 20 years ago , diagnosed from a lymph
node biopsy of the left neck. She was treated for one year with a
combination of medications. She currently experiences no night
sweats , loss or weight , loss of appetite or hemoptysis. She does ,
however , admit to a dry cough especially at night which has been
increasing over the last six months. Her BCG status is unknown.
Past surgical history is remarkable for: 1 ) Status post cesarean
section times one. 2 ) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy ,
right salpingo-oophorectomy for metromenorrhagia approximately
1991. The patient currently denies any post or perimenopausal
symptoms. 3 ) Status post lymph node biopsy of the left neck
approximately 20 years ago for tuberculosis. The patient has no
known drug allergies. Family history is remarkable for diabetes
mellitus ( father ). The patient is a nonsmoker , denies alcohol abuse
or intravenous drug abuse. Medications on admission include
Digoxin 0.1 mg p.o. q a.m. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Glucotrol 10
mg p.o. b.i.d. , K-Dur 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d. and Capoten 37.5
mg p.o. q.i.d.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has noted increasing
dyspnea and worsening exercise
tolerance over the past six months. She was admitted to Namen's General Hospital under the care of Dr. Devera in April of 1992 for
congestive heart failure which resolved with diuresis. Since then
her baseline exercise tolerance is that she is unable to do a full
load of laundry without getting tired , unable to climb a full
flight of steps without getting tired , but does not experience
chest pain. However , today while walking in her sister-in-law's
house she experienced severe retrosternal chest pain radiating to
her left shoulder and back , which is as great as 10 out of 10 for
severity and lasted for approximately one minute. It was associated
with dyspnea , sweating and nausea but no vomiting. She also
experienced some palpitations. Therefore , she had persistent chest
pressure and dyspnea on arrival at the Amar Portraim Hospital
Emergency Room approximately 20 minutes later , at which time the
pressure and dyspnea were relieved with two sublingual nitrates.
Review of systems is remarkable also for chronic cough increasing
over the last five months , especially since her Capoten dose was
increased. She denies fever , chills , previous episodes of
pneumonia. Of note she was ruled out for active pulmonary
tuberculosis during her admission in Soba Medical Center in September 1992.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination on admission , she is a
pleasant , elderly woman. Her vital signs
reveal a temperature of 97.4 orally , heart rate of 80 regular ,
respiratory rate of 20 and blood pressure of 108/80 supine with no
orthostatic hypertension. O2 saturation was 99% on 4 liters. Head
and neck examination were unremarkable with no evidence of
adenopathy and a normal thyroid gland. Respiratory system showed
scattered bibasilar crackles but no focal pathology. Cardiovascular
system showed a heart rate of 80 which was regular at full volume
with occasional ectopic beats. There was no evidence of paradoxical
alternates. Jugular venous pressure was elevated to 10 cm above
the angle of Louis' and had a prominent CV wave. All pulses were
present and equal. The cardiac apex was in the sixth left
intercostal space. Midaxillary line was volume overloaded in
character. No thrills or rubs were appreciated , however , there was
dullness to percussion beyond the apex and an S3 gallop was heard
throughout the precordium. The patient had a soft S1 , a III/VI
pansystolic murmur heard best at the apex and radiating through to
the left axilla. There was also I/VI MVM which could be brought on
with exercise and lying in the left lateral position. A PI murmur
was also heart similar in character to the MI murmur but heard best
on the left sternal border and radiating up the neck. There was
also an ejection systolic murmur at the left sternal border II/VI
in intensity and radiating poorly increased with expiration.
Abdominal examination was soft , nontender , nondistended. There was
a 12 cm hepar which was soft and nonpulsatile. No spring was
palpable. No masses were appreciated. Bowel sounds were present ,
and there was no costovertebral angle tenderness. A well healed
subumbilical midline scar was evident. Rectal examination showed
no masses , guaiac negative brown stool. Bimanual examination was
deferred at this time. Central nervous system examination was
grossly intact. Extremities showed pulses to be present
bilaterally and equal. There was no evidence of deep venous
thrombosis and no pedal edema or sacral edema were appreciated.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory examinations on admission showed a
sodium of 136 , potassium 3.4 , blood urea nitrogen
16 , creatinine 0.8 , and a glucose of 136. White count was 8.2 with
a normal differential. Hematocrit was 41.2 and platelets 247. PT
and PTT were 13.4 and 29.4 respectively. Digoxin level was 2.1.
Chest X ray showed significant cardiomegaly with dilatation of both
left and right ventricles but minimal congestive heart failure. The
electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 86 beats per minute
with a complete left bundle branch block and no evidence of acute
ischemia. There was no change as compared with electrocardiograms
from 2/10 .  The initial CPK was 44.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary then the patient is a 54-year-old woman
with cardiomyopathy , noninsulin-dependent
diabetes , who presented now with an episode of chest pain and
dyspnea for rule out myocardial infarction and further evaluation.
Actively she is in hospital where it as follows: 1 ) Cardiomegaly of
unclear etiology: last echo done was in 25 of November by Dr. Pernin which
showed an ejection fraction of 25-30% with global left and right
ventricular dilatation. 2 ) Chest pressure and substernal chest pain
and dyspnea: The patient was placed on the telemetry floor , was
monitored for 24 hours and a rule out protocol was performed. The
CK were 44 , 37 , and 34 respectively and there was no evidence of
electrocardiogram changes on serial electrocardiogram. She did have
one run of 4-beat ventricular tachycardia the first 24 hours of
admission. Potassium was replaced in view of the potassium level of
3.4. Initial Digoxin level was 2.1 and Digoxin was held for a
period of 72 hours. She was continued on her Lasix , Captopril and
a sliding scale Nitropaste and was started on one aspirin a day.
3 ) Noninsulin-dependent diabetes was well controlled on diet and
Glucotrol and her sugars remained between 100 and 200 throughout
this admission. 4 ) Status post tuberculosis: In view of her
previous tuberculosis status , a PPD was not performed and the
patient was not ruled out for tuberculosis.
On review of Mrs. Ekis 's history and following a rule out for a
recent myocardial infarct , it became apparent that her exercise
tolerance had diminished dramatically over the past three months
and that she was already on optimal medications. It was thought
that she would benefit from a cardiac transplant evaluation at this
point and Dr. Gerathy was kind enough to consult. A transthoracic
echocardiogram performed on 2 of May showed once again a dilated
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. There was 2+ of
mitral regurgitation with a pulmonary arterial pressure of
approximately 60. There was also 3+ or PR and evidence of
significant left atrial hypertrophy. No ventricular clicks or
thrombosis were seen. However , in view of the dilated
cardiomyopathy , the patient was started on Coumadin therapy. An ETT
O2 uptake test was performed on 2 of May and the patient performed
for 3.38 minutes on a cycle ergometer. She experienced on chest
pain and there were no obvious electrocardiogram changes. The test
was stopped because of shortness of breath. Her O2 uptake was
calculated at 11.4 per kick per minute. In addition her Capoten
therapy was changed from 37.5 q.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. At this point
it became apparent that Mrs. Stuesse had a significant degree of
cardiac dysfunction. A right-sided catheterization performed on
5 of August showed a right atrial pressure of 26 and a pulmonary wedge
pressure of 36. It was decided that she would be an excellent
candidate for cardiac transplantation , and a full cardiac
transplant workup was initiated. The following tests were sent off ,
the results of many of which are still pending: 1 ) One chest X ray
detailed above; 2 ) electrocardiogram as detailed; 3 ) urinalysis and
sediment which are unremarkable; 4 ) SMA-7 with CPK , complete with
differential , PT , PTT , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , reticulocyte
count and bleeding time; 5 ) HLA typing and antibody screen which
are pending; 6 ) blood typing; 7 ) dental consult; 8 ) physiotherapy
consult; 9 ) Social Service consult; 10 ) nutrition consult; 11 )
Gynecology appointment made as an outpatient and a booking for
bilateral mammography was made; 12 ) pulmonary function tests were
performed; 13 ) noninvasive carotid Doppler studies and peripheral
arterial noninvasive studies were performed the results of which
are pending; 14 ) echocardiogram as detailed above; 15 ) exercise
test with O2 as detailed above; 16 ) 24-hour urine for creatinine
and protein; 17 ) HIV antibody test; 18 ) fasting glucose serum
protein , electrophoresis , cholesterol , triglycerides ,
immunoglobulins , hepatitis B and C serology , as well as blood
cultures , sputum cultures and urine cultures were sent; 19 )
psychiatric consults , has not been obtained at this point and will
be done as an outpatient; 20 ) virology titers for cytomegalovirus ,
Ebstein-Barr virus , toxoid , measles and varicella zoster were sent;
21 ) TFT and hemoglobin A1C were sent; and 22 ) right heart
catheterization as detailed above; 23 ) abdominal ultrasound to rule
out gallstones , aortic aneurysm and renal abnormalities were done
and were within normal limits.
DISPOSITION: At this point the patient will be discharged home in a
stable but guarded condition. She will be followed by
the Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery Departments at the Chapstone Hospital .  Her primary attending Dr. Mondelli from Sontriad University Hospitals
( telephone number 990 062-8307 ) will be updated as to her program.
Outstanding consults were be sorted on an outpatient basis and she
will be listed for a cardiac transplant. Her discharge medications
include Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d , K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5
mg p.o. t.i.d. She will also be sent home on home O2 as required.
Digoxin will be started at 0.1 mg p.o. q d. PT and PTT levels will
be checked q weekly and the patient's doses changed accordingly.

Discharge Date: 11/17/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE.
PROCEDURES: 1. Third and fifth toe amputation with wound
debridement.
2. Lower extremity angiogram.
3. Right transmetatarsal amputation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45 year old
gentleman with a history of severe
peripheral vascular disease who is status post aorto-bifemoral and
bilateral femoral-popliteal bypass grafting , who originally
presented in August of this year with an ischemic right foot and
gangrenous right great toe and fourth toe. Arteriogram revealed a
popliteal stenosis below his bypass with very poor runoff. The
popliteal artery was angioplastied with good results and
restoration of palpable anterior tibial pulses at the mid calf.
The patient only had moderate perfusion of the right foot , however ,
and presented in August of this year for wound debridement and
fourth toe amputation. The patient re-presents with a poorly
healing fourth toe amputation site and wound cellulitis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has poorly controlled insulin dependent
diabetes. He is status post myocardial
infarction in 1993 , 1996 and 1997. He has severe peripheral
vascular disease. He is status post bilateral femoral-popliteal
and bypass graft. He is status post aorto-bifemoral. He has a
history of coronary artery disease. He is status post coronary
artery bypass graft x three vessel. He has a history of congestive
heart failure , history of osteoarthritis.
MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.day , Lasix 120 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Zestril 50 mg p.o. q.day , aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.day , insulin NPH 10 units q.a.m. , q.p.m. and insulin Regular
sliding scale.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient is afebrile. Temperature was 98.2 ,
blood pressure 100/80 , pulse 85 ,
respirations 16. He had saturation of 98% on room air. In
general , he is a white male in no acute distress. HEENT was
normocephalic , atraumatic. Pupils were equally reactive to light
and accommodation. Extraocular muscles were intact. Sclerae were
anicteric. There was no lymphadenopathy. Lungs were clear to
auscultation. Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen
was soft , nontender , nondistended , with normal active bowel sounds.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal. Extremities were without clubbing ,
cyanosis or edema. On vascular exam , patient had 3+ bilateral
femoral pulses , 2+ bilateral popliteal pulses. He had biphasic
dopplerable bilateral posterior tibial pulses and a monophasic
dopplerable right dorsalis pedis pulse and no dopplerable left
dorsalis pedis pulse. His right great toe had a black eschar on
the tip. His fourth toe amputation site was with purulent
drainage. His third toe was erythematous and tender to palpation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the vascular service
for wound debridement and IV antibiotics. He was
initially evaluated by the cardiology service and endocrine
service. Patient was cleared by cardiology for the procedure and
was considered well managed medically in regard to his coronary
artery disease. In regard to patient's diabetes , he was initially
extremely brittle and requiring extensive fine tuning by the
endocrine service who , at the time of discharge , had his blood
sugars repeatedly under 200 , with easily achieved insulin regimen.
The patient was taken to the operating room initially on the 13 of June of
April where he underwent a right third and fifth toe amputation
with wound debridement. At the time of operation , purulent
drainage with necrotic regions of the bases of the third and fifth
toes were found. The wound was left open with packing , with
further plans for more formal TMA after adequate drainage of the
foot. The patient , from the beginning of the hospital course , was
started on IV vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl which he
continued throughout his hospital course. The patient tolerated
this initial wound debridement and toe amputation without incident.
Please see dictated operative report for further details. The
patient underwent an arteriogram on the 30 of August of April which
revealed one vessel runoff via peroneal artery to an irregular
appearing posterior tibial artery. The tibial peroneal trunk and
the proximal peroneal artery were found to have high grade
stenoses. There were numerous collateral vessels to a dorsalis
pedis artery at the level of the ankle. Based on this arteriogram
result and his wound , patient was preop'd for a transmetatarsal
amputation on the 2 of June of April . It was recommended by the
vascular staff that transmetatarsal amputation was the only option
for proximal limb salvage. He was not found to have any
appropriate anatomy for further reconstruction from an arterial
standpoint. The patient was taken to the operating room on the
2 of June of April where he underwent a formal right transmetatarsal
amputation. The patient's wound was debrided back to the viable
tissue and was closed in a primary fashion. Please see dictated
operative report for further details. Patient tolerated the
procedure well without complications and was transported back to
the PACU and the floor in stable condition. Postoperatively , the
patient has required wound packing to a small portion of the wound
which was left open for drainage. Initially , the wound was
erythematous with minimal to moderate drainage. At the time of
discharge , the wound has become far less erythematous , far less
painful and without any drainage. It is thought at this time that
patient now had three weeks of IV antibiotics and is stable enough
to go home on a p.o. regimen. Patient will be discharged on p.o.
levofloxacin and clindamycin with b.i.d. wound packing by VNA
service. Patient is discharged to home in stable condition with
followup to be early this week with Dr. Deandrade . Patient is also
recommended to call his cardiologist for appointment in 1-2 weeks
and his primary care physician in 1-2 weeks as well.

Discharge Date: 10/2/1996
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year old gravida
5 , para 5 , with history of
postmenopausal bleeding and thickened endometrial stripe by
ultrasound. She had a history of breast cancer status post
lumpectomy , radiotherapy , and Tamoxifen therapy with the Tamoxifen
therapy ongoing over the past four years. She was evaluated and
Pipelle biopsy was unsuccessful and fractional dilation and
curettage revealed scant inactive endometrial tissue. This was in
January of 1994. She had a follow-up endometrial biopsy which showed
quantity not sufficient and there was no further follow-up. All of
this was done outside of our offices. She saw Dr. Lamoreux for
evaluation initially of an irregular cervix on her initial intake
into the Ard Onhill Hospital Medical Center system and this history
was reviewed. She had always had normal Pap smears. Colposcopic
biopsy and endocervical curettage were all negative. She had not
at that point had postmenopausal bleeding for a couple of years.
Her uterus was felt to be overly enlarged and ultrasound showed a
1.9 cm irregular stripe. Pipelle was not possible , due perhaps to
stenosis of the internal os. Therefore she was brought for
fractional dilation and curettage and diagnostic hysteroscopy as an
inpatient because of her history of Coumadin therapy for chronic
atrial fibrillation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for rheumatic heart disease with
mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation , as
well as aortic insufficiency and mild tricuspid insufficiency. She
has had a history of chronic congestive heart failure. Chronic
atrial fibrillation is noted. Breast cancer is noted. There is a
question of a pulmonary edema in 1993.
MEDICATIONS: Tamoxin , Coumadin , Furosemide , Inderal , Lanoxin , Kay
Ciel.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , erythromycin , and Isordil.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke and does not drink.
PAST OB/GYN HISTORY: Spontaneous vaginal deliveries times five.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Beyond the breast surgery , this included
appendectomy in 1994 , as well as fractional
dilation and curettage in 1994.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Basically unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was preadmitted for switch-over to
heparin therapy. The heparin was then stopped
four hours prior to her surgical procedure which occurred on
4/11/96 . The findings at hysteroscopy and dilation and curettage
included normal appearing endocervical canal , 7.5 cm cavity , and an
approximately 3 x 1 cm endometrial polyp. She had lush
endometrium. The ostia were not easily visualized. The procedure
was very smooth and done under MAC anesthesia with paracervical
block and she had a minimal blood loss. Postoperatively she did
quite well without fever or other problems. She was put back on
her Coumadin such that , on the day of discharge , her INR was
approaching 2.0. She was discharged with plans for follow-up as an
outpatient regarding her Coumadin therapy.

Hospital course:
Generalized pain: She has a history of both rheumatoid arthritis
and fibromyalgia and some symptoms that have been concerning for
Polymyalgia rheumatica. For her acute pain exacerbation , a pain consult
was obtained and recommended using vicodin rather than dilaudid and
neurontin rather that topamax. These changes were made with good effect. A
rheumatology consult was also obtained and
suggested starting prednisone 10mg qd for possible PMR with close
follow up with her rheumatologist Dr. Dambrosi . They also suggested starting
calcium + vitaminD. Her pain improved on the
prednisone and she was seen by physical therapy who suggested
rehab placement for deconditioning and inability to care for herself.
**Renal: During the hospitalization , she developed new acute renal
failure due to decreased PO intake of fluids and continuation of her home
dose of lasix of 160qd which she then stated she had not been taking.
This was due to a pre-renal state and resolved completely with IV fluids.
**Depression: She was continued on her home regimen of elavil , seroquel ,
zoloft , and buspar.
**Diabetes Mellitus: She was continued on her home insulin regimen with
excellent control.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: PLease return if you develop fevers , chills , worsening shortness of
breath.

Lopressor 5mg , Morphine 2mg , Nitro SL , Hydral 10mg , Dilaudid. BP
decreased to 120/78. EKG showed new T wave inversions in AVF and V6 with
pseudonormalization of T wave in AVL. CT chest negative for dissection.
Serial troponins were <0.10 , 0.13 , <0.10 , bump likely result of demand
ischemia. As pt's CP was reproducible on palpation , not likely to be of
cardiac source , somewhat improved with narcotics. Pt maintained on home
regimen , with BP control from 120-160/60-90 in house. Echo showed severe
LVH , EF 50-55% , diastolic dysfunction , basal inferior akinetic , basal
superior dyskinetic , mid-posterior hypokinetic , unchanged from prev. Pt
will follow up with outpatient cardiologist Dr. Dodimead .
*Neuro: Pt described HA and episodes of vision loss in R eye lasting 5-10
minutes , concerning for amaurosis fugax vs atypical migraine vs temporal
arteritis ( had been biopsied for temporal arteritis in 10/5 because of
HA and elevated ESR - neg ). Neuro and Ophtho consulted. Pt described
vision loss as bilateral to consults - less concerning for embolic event.
MRA demonstrated no carotid stenosis or occlusion. ESR was only mildly
elevated at 32. Pt is already on aspirin , Plavix , statin and BP meds for
stroke prevention as per Neuro recs , though they recommended follow up
with outpatient Rheum to w/u temporal arteritis if sx continue. Ophtho
exam demonstrated typical dermoid in L eye ( unrelated to sx ) , retinal exam
showed evidence of PVD but no emboli , consult thought presentation not
consistent with giant cell arteritis , most likely atypical migraine.
*Pulm: Pt maintained on home regimen of Advair for asthma and CPAP at
night for OSA , no exacerbations in the hospital.
*Renal: Cr increased from 1.2 on admission ( baseline 1.0-1.8 , most likely
2/2 to chronic HTN ) to 1.7 on HD #2. Urine lytes demonstrated Na 100 Cl
78 Cr 152.3 ( FeNa 0.56% ) , UA showed 2+ LE. 10-15 WBC , 2+ bast6 , 1+ sq ,
but not treated because pt asymptomatic.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: -continue home medication regimen , but increase labetalol to 200
mg twice a day , norvasc to 5 mg twice a day , oxycontin dose to 50 mg
three times a day ( 40 mg home dose + 10 mg prescribed in hospital )
-make appointment to follow up with primary care physician Dr. Edward R Freeland
-follow up with cardiologist Dr. Krull on 5/10 at 2:40 pm ( his office
will call you if an appointment can be made earlier )
-fluid restricted ( 2 L ) and salt restricted ( 2 mg ) diet
-return to hospital if symptoms worsen
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
-continue home regimen , but increased labetalol to 200 mg BID , norvasc to
5 mg BID , oxycontin dose from 40 mg to 50 mg TID
-f/u with cardiologist Dr. Kinzer
-f/u with PCP Dr. Abram Blazina
-consider modification of HTN regimen if pressures not well controlled

admitted for NSTEMI ( MIBI with mod LCX disease and severe HK ) ,
patient declined cath. Patient currently being tx for osteo with po
linezolid/levo to complete 3wk course ( declined PICC and arterial
bipass ). Pt in USOH until 24hrs prior to admission when
she noted SOB , orthopnea , and increased edema. +URI sx and fever
100.2. No BRBPR , hematuria , or melena.

edema , no clear infiltrate but tech poor study
****HOSPITAL COURSE/PLAN*****
70yo now with new anemia and CHF. 1 ) CV-I: continue ROMI , positive
troponin likely anemia related demand; BB , statin ,
ASA 2 ) CV-P: appears vol overloaded , maybe be 2/2 to
med/diet non-compliance. Goal diuresis 1-2L/d met. Follow closely
during
transfusions. Echo 8/28 showed EF 55% , no
RWMA. We discharged this patient on 80 mg PO lasix with standing
potassium , she will be followed closely by VNA. 3 ) CV-R: no issues , on
tele for
RO 4 ) Heme: unclear etiology of anemia , most likely
2/2 to linezolid , other possibilities ACD , CKD , slow GI loss ( guiaic
neg ). Checking iron , retic , smear , hemolysis labs. Transfuse to goal
HCT 30. She received 2 units PRBC on night of admission and then hct
was stable. She had iron and vitamin B12 deficiency and was started on
supplements. 5 ) Renal: creatinine at BL at
1.6. 6 ) ID: R calcaneal osteo with MRSA ( bx
confirmed ) , planned treatment until 8/22 based on last discharge summary.
Change to vanco for concern of
marrow suppresion of linezolid. ID curbside is to use linezolid ,
and treat anemia w/ PRBC. needs 6 week course from 2/12/05 . Check BCx ,
foot films show no osteomyelitis , sputum cx shows klebsiella , likely
colonizer. Patient repeatedly refused PICC. She also believes
abdominal discomfort largely due to linezolid. Plastics evaluated the
heel and felt was healing nicely. To finish up 6 week course from
2/12/05 , we discharged the patient on linezolid until October , as
patient refused PICC for vanco. 7 ) GI: gastroparesis , giving reglan and
sucralfate. Aggressive bowel regimen. Patient finally responded to
miralax and lactulose , producing large BMs ( KUB showed much stool ) and
relief of abdominal distention and discomfort. 8 ) Pulm: SOB likely 2/2
to
pulm edema and anemia. 9 ) FEN: hyponatremia , pt has h/o hyponatremia.

q.d.; K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q.d.; albuterol and Atrovent; Pulmicort 4
puffs b.i.d.; MVI 1 tab p.o. q.d.; allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.d.;
Neurontin t.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Theophylline , which gives her anaphylaxis , and to both
sulfa and dye , which are of unclear significance.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. She quit smoking one week prior
to admission. She smoked one pack per day for 50
years. She rarely uses alcohol. She has three grown children.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother with a history of MI at age 75. Father
with a history of lung cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Elderly female in no apparent
distress. VITAL SIGNS: Temp 99 , pulse 100 ,
BP 130/60 , respiratory rate 20 , satting 96% on two liters. HEENT:
PERRL , EOMI , oropharynx benign , no erythema or exudate. No sinus
tenderness. NECK: Supple , no JVD , no bruits , no lymphadenopathy.
CHEST: Revealed rales at the right base , otherwise no wheezes at
the left. HEART: Regular rhythm and rate , normal S1 , S2 , II/VI
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
positive bowel sounds , soft , diffusely tender , no
hepatosplenomegaly , no masses. EXTREMITIES: Bilateral non-pitting
edema , left greater than right , with mild lower extremity erythema ,
also left greater than right. NEURO: Alert and oriented x3 ,
cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Her left
index and middle finger PIP joints were warm and tender.
LABORATORY DATA: White count 13.4 , hematocrit 33 , platelets 211.
Na 136 , K 4.3 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.1. CK 47 ,
troponin 0.14. EKG showed normal sinus tach at 125 beats/minute.
She had a new incomplete right bundle branch block , left atrial
enlargement , no acute ST or T-wave changes. Chest x-ray revealed
question of a right lower lobe infiltrate. This was also
consistent with a mild pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Sartoris , in the Emergency Department , was
treated with IV cefuroxime. She was subsequently
brought to the floor , and the Medical Team's assessment decided to
treat her empirically for a right lower lobe pneumonia with
levofloxacin. It was not all that clear that Ms. Bartlett had a
pneumonia , but she was treated for this anyway. She also had a
urine Legionella antigen , which was checked , as well as sputum
cultures which were unremarkable.
From a cardiovascular perspective , Ms. Cheesman ruled out for a
myocardial infarction , but received some Lasix for mild CHF.
During her hospital course , it was noted that her hematocrit
dropped from 33.3 to 28.4. This was mildly concerning given her
history of an infrarenal AAA. It was decided that she should have
an abdominal CT. This was done , and the abdominal aortic aneurysm
has not changed in size or did not reveal any evidence of leaking.
Ms. Villenas quickly improved after being treated with nebulizers.
She was then switched from nebulizers to inhalers and it was
decided that she was well enough to go home. Of note , her right
finger joints were mildly swollen and possibly consistent with a
gouty flare. She was treated initially with Indocin , but then
there was the concern that she could potentially have a GI bleed.
Thus , she was quickly taken off of the Indocin.
Ms. Peteet was discharged in stable condition to follow-up with her
primary care physician. Her discharge medications were as follows:
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 2 ) albuterol
inhalers; ( 3 ) allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.d.;
( 4 ) Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; ( 5 ) Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 6 )
glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 7 ) nitroglycerin SL p.r.n. chest pain;
( 8 ) Afrin 2 sprays intranasally b.i.d.; ( 9 ) MVI 1 tab p.o. q.d.;
( 10 ) simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.; ( 11 ) Atrovent inhaler q.i.d.;
( 12 ) Neurontin 200 mg p.o. t.i.d.; ( 13 ) levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
q.d. x10 days; ( 14 ) Pulmicort 4 puffs inhaled q.i.d.;
( 15 ) Combivent 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: The patient was to follow-up with Dr. Poitevint .
It was decided that she would require VNA
nursing to provide chest PT 3-4x over the course of the following
week. She is to have a follow-up chest x-ray in several weeks to
reassess the right lower lobe.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Aswegan is a 74-year-old woman ,
recently admitted to the Kimonte on 1/14/05 for CHF
exacerbation and UTI ( Gram-negative rods , Klebsiella ) who
presents to the Vide Tutenoke Rahbrier Healthcare with one day of abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting , and decreased ostomy output. The patient has a history
of multiple abdominal surgeries including a total colectomy for
ulcerative colitis with colostomy , ventral hernia repairs in
1998 , 2003 , and 2004 , revision of her colostomy in 1996 , 1997 ,
and 2003. As a result , she has had a chronic left lower quadrant
hernia. The patient denies any recent fevers , chills , melena , or
hematochezia from the ostomy. She has stable dyspnea on exertion
after 12 feet , she uses a walker at home. She denies PND. She
has two-pillow orthopnea. She has had stable lower extremity
edema in the past day and no dysuria. She also has a history of
a dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15 to 20% , MI
20 years ago , diabetes mellitus type 2 , coronary artery disease ,
and chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
approximately 1.8 to 2. In the emergency room , she was given 2
mg of Dilaudid IV for pain plus another 1 mg IV as well as Zofran
1 mg IV. An NG tube was placed , and hooked to suction , which
drained 1 liter of green fluid that was guaiac negative. CT of
the abdomen and pelvis showed high-grade small-bowel obstruction
with a transition point at the left lower quadrant hernia ,
dilated small-bowel loops , and fat stranding. A second
radiologist per the surgical note said that the transition point
may have actually been distal to the hernia and may have been
located within the pelvis. After surgical evaluation , the
patient was admitted to the floor for conservative medical
management of her small-bowel obstruction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs , temperature
96.4 , pulse 84 , blood pressure 132/70 , respiratory rate 14 , and
sat 97% on room air. The patient was pale , ill appearing with an
NG tube in place. Her cardiac exam revealed an S3 gallop. PMI
was displaced and sustained. Heart rate was regular in rate and
rhythm. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Abdomen was distended
and tender , no rebound or guarding. The left lower quadrant
hernia was approximately 15 cm in size and reducible. The ostomy
was without any output. Neurological exam revealed no focal
deficits or facial droops.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: None.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. GI: The patient presented with a small-bowel obstruction.
The point of transition was thought to be in the pelvis by the
second Radiology opinion , she was kept n.p.o. , NG tube to
suction. SBO resolved on 4/4/05 . Her abdominal exam improved.
Her pain improved. At the time of discharge , her ostomy was
putting out green stool. Lactate levels were followed , with a
peak of 1.4 and then back down to 0.8. The patient was kept on
an IV proton pump inhibitor , then switched to p.o. At the time
of discharge , her diet was being advanced as tolerated. She was
tolerating a mechanical soft diet.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient has CHF with an EF of 15 to 20%.
She was gently hydrated during the small-bowel obstruction. Her
digoxin was continued. Her beta-blocker was switched to
Lopressor. Her diuretics were held. Her hydralazine and Isordil
were held as well as her aspirin in the event that she should go
to the operating room. These were added back. At the time of
discharge , she was on Coreg , hydralazine , Isordil , digoxin , and
aspirin at her home doses. Diuretic can be added back for
diuresis , once the patient is taking improved p.o.'s. The
patient had several runs of V-TAC and frequent PVCs on the
monitor. Her electrolytes were corrected for a potassium of 4
and magnesium of 2. She was asymptomatic with these rhythms.
Her heart rate was in the 90s. Her blood pressure was in the
110s/50s-70s at the time of discharge.
3. Endocrine: The patient was continued on 15 units of NPH
q.a.m. , 7 units of NPH q.p.m. , as well as a Regular Insulin
sliding scale for very strict glucose control. This regimen
resulted in occasional episodes of hypoglycemia to 33 and 44
respectively. The patient was symptomatic with a blood sugar of
33. She received an amp of D50 and her blood sugar improved. Her
regimen was adjusted at the time of discharge , she was on NPH 8
units subcu q.a.m. and a Regular Insulin sliding scale. Her NPH
should be titrated as her oral intake improves. The patient is
on chronic prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis. She was switched
to hydrocortisone 10 mg IV q.8h. She did not require a stressed
dose. She was switched back to her oral dose of prednisone.
4. Renal: The patient's phenol on presentation was 0.25. Her
creatinine was 2.8 , which was elevated from her baseline after
discharge at Ketchwo of 2.4. Her creatinine rose to 3.3 and
then began to trend down. Her creatinine was 2.4 and then 2.3 on
the day of discharge. Her acute on chronic renal failure was
thought to represent dehydration as well as poor forward flow due
to third spacing and decreased intravascular volumes. Her blood
pressures tended to be on the low side when she was first
admitted. These improved with rehydration to the point where her
home blood pressure medications could be restarted.
5. ID: The patient was started on levofloxacin 500 mg IV
q.4-8h. and Flagyl 500 mg IV q.8h. for an elevated white count on
admission of 14.65 with 87.3% neutrophils. Her blood cultures
from 6/12/05 were positive , two out of four bottles in 24 hours
for Gram-positive cocci identified as MRSA. She was started on
vancomycin 1 gm IV q.48h. This will need to be continued for a
total of two weeks , start day 6/20/05 , stop day 8/7/06 .
Levofloxacin and Flagyl were started on 7/11/05 , stop date
4/16/06 . The patient remained afebrile and her bands trended
down from a peak of 39 to 3 the day prior to discharge.
6. Rheumatologic: The patient was continued on steroids for
rheumatoid arthritis and chronic steroid dependence.
7. Neuro: The patient had episodes of disorientation , likely
due to sundowning two days prior to placement. She required 0.5
mg of IV Haldol for extreme agitation. She also required
trazodone 100 mg p.o. q.h.s. for sleep.
8. Physical therapy: The patient was out of bed to chair. She
typically walks with a walker. She will require rehabilitation
for improved coordination and strength.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient was on proton pump inhibitor and
Lovenox during the course of her stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Pending.
The remainder of the dictation will be completed at the time of
discharge.

****************************************
62 y/o woman w/ MRSA UTI.
1 ) UTI: initially rx w/ bactrim but we d/cd this 2/2 elev Cr ,
electrolye abnormalities and switched to vancomycin on which her
symptoms improved. Thus , we had a PICC line inserted so she cou
ld complete a 14 day course of antibiotics for this complicated
MRSA+ UTI. Blood cxs were drawn to r/o bacteremia given her low grade
temps and were neg to date. We also gave her 3 days of pyridium for sx
relief. The patient will hang her own vancomycin at home.
2 ) Renal insufficiency: baseline 50/2.5; checked urine lytes which
suggested patient was dry and we initiated gentle hydration given
her underlying CHF. This and teh blood we gave her have helped her Cr
return to baseline. Renal US normal. She did have hematuria which may h
ave been 2/2 the foley , though she also had some mild urinary retention
and we are suggesting an outpt cystoscopy.
3 )CV: We were holding her ACE + diuretic until her last day of
admission due to her volume status and Cr elev. we monitored her BP
off of these meds which was stable; We continued her coumadin and her
INR was stable. We restarted her ACE and diuretic( but d/cd her on 2mg
qd of bumex instead of 2 bid which she came in on ).
4 ) DM: we continued her home insulin and her FS were well controlled
on this regimen
5 ) Dispo: w/ PICC line and abx for 10 more days. Pt should follow up
with Dr. Schupbach her PCP.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take your medications as prescribed and listed on the discharge
papers , including your vancomycin.
Please be sure to contact Dr. Lapinski to set up an appointment.
If you being to re-experience severe burning again with urination or if
you begin to get high fevers , please call your doctor or return to the

Discharge Date: 8/10/2005
ATTENDING: LEIFER , JEFFEREY GRAHAM MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Endocarditis , urinary tract infection.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Mitral regurgitation , diabetes ,
hypertension , congestive heart failure , recurrent UTIs , uterine
prolapse , hyperlipidemia , hiatal hernia , right breast nodule.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old with a
history of severe mitral regurgitation , history of congestive
heart failure with an ejection fraction of 60% in 6/8 , chronic
abdominal discomfort , history of recurrent UTIs , and uterine
prolapse , who one week prior to admission developed increased
nausea , decreased appetite , weakness , fatigue and increased low
back pain. No vomiting , diarrhea , cough , or dysuria. On
presentation , the patient was found to be hypotensive , in septic
shock , with bacteremia in urinary tract infection and admitted to
the Medical ICU for pressure support.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for heart rate of 94 ,
blood pressure of 80-90/50. Notable for heart exam with regular
rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , with 3/6 systolic crescendo
murmur and decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border
radiating to the clavicles and carotids , and 3/6 holosystolic
murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla , and an apical heave.
JVP flat. Chest with crackles in the right middle lung fields and
leg basilar crackles. Abdominal exam was benign. Guaiac
negative. Extremities with no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema and
1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
RELEVANT STUDIES AND TESTS: Blood culture on 10/13
Streptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin MIC
0.19. Urine culture on 10/13 Greater than 100 , 000 Klebsiella
pneumoniae , ampicillin resistant , gentamicin sensitive , and
levofloxacin sensitive. TEE on 10/17 Severe mitral
regurgitation , posterior leaflet with mitral calcifications and
linear density concerning for endocarditis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
IMPRESSION: A 76-year-old female with mitral regurgitation ,
history of CHF , history of recurrent UTI , who presented with
nausea and chills , had hypotension requiring a medical ICU stay x
2 days , with Streptococcus viridans bacteremia and mitral
calcifications in linear density concerning for endocarditis plus
Klebsiella UTI.
1. Infectious disease: The patient presented with chills and
hypotension and was admitted to the MICU from the ED for
treatment of septic shock. Her mean arterial pressures were kept
above 65 with Levophed. She initially was treated with
levofloxacin and vancomycin to treat Gram-positive cocci
bacteremia and UTI. Blood culture from 5/15 , grew out
Streptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin MIC
0.19. Urine culture was positive for Klebsiella , ampicillin
resistant , gentamicin and levofloxacin sensitive. On 1/11 ,
antibiotics were changed to penicillin 3 million units IV q.4h.
and gentamicin 50 mg IV q.8h. ATEE on 5/29 showed severe mitral
regurgitation with posterior leaflet calcifications and linear
density concerning for endocarditis. Therefore , a PICC line was
placed on 10/11 for continuation of a six-week course of
penicillin 3 million units IV q.4h. until 1/3 and two-week
course of gentamicin 50 mg IV q.8h. until 9/12 .  She will follow
up in the Infectious Disease Clinic with Dr. Ramiro Halcom on
1/5/05 at 8 a.m.
2. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was maintained on
aspirin. Lipitor was initially helped for an initial
transaminitis presumed to be secondary to shock liver , that at
the time of discharge her liver enzymes had normalized and she
was restarted on her Lipitor. Pump: The patient has a history
of congestive heart failure , with an ejection fraction 60% in
6/8 .  She had hypotension , requiring Levophed until 2/5 .  She
had an episode of flash pulmonary edema on 6/16 in the setting
of fluid bolus and one unit of packed red blood cells. She has a
very attenuatus balance between preload dependence and overload.
Her Lasix and ACE-I were held while she was hypotensive. Because
her systolic blood pressure continued to be low in the 90s and
low 100s , attempt was not made to re-add the ACE while in the
hospital. It is anticipated that her cardiologist and outpatient
physicians will attempt to add the ACE back onto her medical
regimen for better afterload reduction as her blood pressure
tolerates. The patient also has a very severe mitral
regurgitation , which would be one of the reasons that an ACE on
her medication regimen would be beneficial. Rhythm: The patient
was maintained on telemetry , and was found to be a normal sinus
rhythm with ectopy , including short once of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia. She was started on Lopressor 12.5 mg
t.i.d. on 1/11 , and this was increased to 25 mg b.i.d. at
discharge , with her heart rates continuing to be between the 70s
and the 90s , however , with less episodes of ectopy. Her
electrolytes were also well repleted.
3. Gastrointestinal: The patient had evidence of shock liver
( 4/10 with an ALT of 135 , AST of 177 , alkaline phosphatase of
251 , and T bili of 1.7 ) that is now resolving. Lipitor was held ,
and was started as a transaminitis resolved. Non-contrast CT of
the abdomen showed biliary sludge and gallstones , no evidence of
acute cholecystitis. Right upper quadrant ultrasound confirmed
the CT findings. Colon cancer is a concern with the patient's
anemia being new since 5/8 .  Her last colonoscopy was in 2000 ,
and she will benefit from repeat colonoscopy as an outpatient.
She was continued on Nexium for prophylaxis. Heme: The patient
had guaiac positive stools in the medical ICU , her hematocrit was
stable around 33%. She has a microcytic anemia with an MCV of
79 , her iron studies ( iron of 10 , TIBC of 191 , ferritin is 744 )
suggesting anemia of chronic disease with possibly overlying iron
deficiency.
4. Endocrine: The patient had a normal random cortisol level of
35.3. She had an uncertain diagnosis of diabetes and was on the
Portland protocol in the medical ICU. Hemoglobin A1c , however ,
was 6.5. Therefore , she was maintained thereafter only on
insulin sliding scale and rarely required any coverage.
5. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on Lovenox and Protonix.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , iron sulfate 325 mg
daily , gentamicin sulfate 50 mg IV q.8h. until 9/12 for a
two-week course , penicillin G potassium 3 million units IV q.4h.
until 1/3 for a six-week course , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. ,
Caltrate plus D2 tablets p.o. daily , Lipitor 10 mg daily , and
Protonix 40 mg daily. The patient has not been restarted on her
home Lasix and lisinopril secondary to persistently low blood
pressures between the 90s and 100s. It is anticipated that
especially her Lisinopril and her Lasix will be added back on to
her medical regimen as her blood pressure tolerates. Given that
she was no longer on Lasix , she was also taken potassium
chloride.
DISPOSITION: The patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation
at Acanmingpeerra Virg Tantblu Medical Center in order to be able to get her antibiotic
therapy. She was discharged on stable condition.
PHYSICIANS FOLLOW-UP: The patient has been following follow-up
appointments:
1. Stress test in 2/6/05 at 3 p.m.
2. Dr. Gale Montante ( general cardiology ) on 7/10/05 at 10 a.m.
3. Dr. Ed Storti 3/22/05 at 12 p.m.
4. Dr. Stacey Koers ( infectious disease ) 1/5/05 at 8 a.m.
The patient will follow up regarding the success of her
antibiotic therapy. It is also anticipated that her cardiologist
will re-add back on her ACE for better afterload reduction as her
blood pressures tolerates , and potentially we will add her back
on to the Lasix as well. She will require weekly lab draws to
check her electrolytes and CBC while she is on the antibiotics.
CONSULTANTS: Infectious disease , Dr. Rupert Zenon , pager
number 55757.
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Dr. Abel Guignard .
The patient is full code. Her family is aware of the situation.

SERVICE: Cardiology Team VT
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Geoffrey D. Heebsh MD , PHD.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
LIST OF PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , status post
myocardial infarction; diabetes mellitus; hypertension;
hypothyroidism; and anxiety.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , this is an 82-year-old male
with a history of CHF with an EF 10% to 15% who is status post
MI , history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and
hypothyroidism. There is also a question of a history of atrial
fibrillation as well.
In the past 2 months , the patient had complaints of increasing
dyspnea on exertion with being unable to walk from one end of the
room to the other without becoming short of breath; a mild weight
gain of 3 pounds as well; and a stable , 2-pillow orthopnea.
On August , 2005 , the patient awakened from sleep with a sudden
onset of shortness of breath and chest pressure associated with
nausea and vomiting. The patient presented to an outside
hospital emergency department where his blood pressure was
stable , and he was saturating 94% on room air. He was treated
with IV Lopressor and nitroglycerin , sublingual and topical. He
was admitted at that hospital , and Cardiology was consulted who
diagnosed him with a mild CHF by his physical examination. A
chest x-ray was with bibasilar opacities that were more likely
atelectasis. The patient was ruled out for an MI at that
hospital and treated with Lasix at the home doses of Lasix 40 mg
p.o. b.i.d. with stable systolic blood pressures of 100s to 110s.
His course at that hospital was complicated by a nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia through which he was asymptomatic. He
was started on Lovenox b.i.d. for a low EF.
The patient was transferred to the Laismode Hospital
on May , 2005 , for elective placement of an AICD.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Atrial fibrillation , anxiety , CHF with an
EF of 10% to 15% , MI , diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,
hypothyroidism , status post cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis ,
and a history of probable prostate ??___??.
MEDICATIONS: The patient's home medications had included Lasix
40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , KCl 10 mEq q.d. , glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. ,
Levoxyl 150 mcg q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg
q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , atenelol 25 mg p.o. q.d. ,
trazodone 50 mg to 100 mg q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , and Ativan 0.5
mg p.r.n.
Transfer medications include digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , levothyroxine
150 mcg q.d. , glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 20
mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
atenelol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , KCl 10 mEq
p.o. q.d. , trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and Ativan 0.5 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , and there is a question whether the patient was currently
on Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneously b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is an ex-smoker and quit smoking
greater than 20 years ago. He lives with his wife.
FAMILY HSITORY: Both the parents of the patient are with a CAD
in their 70s.
PHYSICAL EXAMIANTION: The patient's vital signs upon arriving on
the floor; temperature was 94.5 , pulse was 64 , blood pressure was
120/60 , respirations were 20 , and he was saturating 98% on room
air. Examination was remarkable for JVP at his jaw and moist
mucous membranes. Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with
frequent ectopy and S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4. The lungs were with a
faint left bibasilar crackles. Abdomen was benign. The
extremities were with no pitting edema but slightly cool
bilaterally. Neurological examination is nonfocal.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Remarkable for a creatinine of 0.9.
CBC was unremarkable. BNP was 2035. INR was 1.3 , and PTT was
37.4.
Of note , an echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital on
July , 2005 , showed an EF of 10% to 15% , moderate left atrial
enlargement , right atrial enlargement , mild to moderate aortic
regurgitation , mild MR and mild TR , and pulmonary artery
pressures of 45.
An ETT myoview performed at the outside hospital showed a large
fixed defect inferiorly and inferolaterally as well as a mild
ischemia in the lateral wall.
EKG at the outside hospital performed on July , 2005 , was with
sinus rhythm; right bundle-branch block with T wave inversion in
V1 through V4; Q waves in II , III , and aVF; first-degree AV
block; and a question of a left anterior fascicular block.
A chest x-ray at the outside hospital on August , 2005 , was with
bibasilar opacities with a question of atelectasis versus
pneumonia.
Admission EKG here on May , 2005 , was unchanged from the
outside hospital.
Admission chest x-ray on done on May , 2005 , showed
cardiomegaly and mild bilateral costophrenic angle blunting.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Subjectively , this is an 82-year-old male with
a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 10% to 15% status post myocardial infarction , hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus , and hypothyroidism who was transferred to the
Las Health Network for an elective automatic
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. The patient had no active
ischemia. He does have a history of a myocardial infarction ,
which was inferior in area. His ETT-MIBI was with mild lateral
wall ischemia with a large fixed inferior and inferolateral
defect. The patient was continued on aspirin , ACE inhibitor , and
statin and restarted on his beta-blocker. A catheterization was
performed on May , 2005 , which demonstrated a left dominant
system and no significant left main or left anterior descending
artery lesions. A left posterior descending artery had an 80%
lesion in the mid posterior descending artery. Ejection fraction
was estimated at 15% with global hypokinesis and dilated left
atrium and dilated left ventricle. The patient had elevated
wedge pressure of 42 and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
2. Pump: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
On admission , he was volume overloaded with a BNP of 2035. On
admission , the patient was treated with Lasix , Isordil , ACE
inhibitor , and digoxin. Hydralazine was added. A
catheterization on May , 2005 , demonstrated elevated left
heart-filling pressures. The patient was diuresed subsequently
with more than 4 liters and was euvolemic upon discharge. The
patient is currently euvolemic on p.o. Lasix to being slightly
dry. Given increased CO2 but a normal BUN and creatinine , we
have changed the patient's Lasix dose to 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 40
mg p.o. q.p.m. upon discharge. Given the systolic blood
pressures in the 90s and 100s , the patient's lisinopril was
changed to 20 mg p.o. q.d. The patient is to be followed by VNA
at home to monitor blood pressure.
3. Rhythm: The patient was followed by EP. His admission
electrocardiogram showed a right bundle-branch block with a
question of left anterior fascicular block and a first-degree
arteriovenous block. On October , 2005 , the patient became
suddenly bradycardic to the 30s and 40s with nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia x30 beats and a new second-degree
arteriovenous block type 1. The patient was asymptomatic
throughout this. Zoll pads were placed , and atropine was put at
the bedside. On August , 2005 , the patient appeared to be back in
normal sinus rhythm. On August , 2005 , a pacemaker with automatic
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed with cardiac
resynchronization therapy as well. This was interrogated on June , 2005 , and the ??___?? were confined. The patient will follow
up with Dr. Valko in EP on July , 2005 , at 10:20 a.m. The
patient is to avoid vigorous activity.
4. Endocrine: The patient is with diabetes mellitus and was
covered with regular insulin sliding scale here. He was advised
to restart on his home dose of glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. upon
discharge. The patients' history of hypothyroidism and thyroid
function test is consistent with sick euthyroid syndrome. He was
continued on levothyroxine at his home dose.
5. Psychiatry: The patient is given trazodone and Ativan q.h.s.
p.r.n. The patient's mental status was somewhat decreased on the
night of August , 2005 , status post automatic implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator placement. He was not oriented to
time. This later resolved by the evening of September , 2005.
6. Genitourinary: The patient was noted to have bloody urine
after receiving heparin during the catheterization thought
secondary to Foley trauma. There were no clots; however , given
significant hematuria , ??___?? Foley was placed and bladder
irrigation was started. Urinalysis was negative. Urine was pink
colored by the night of September , 2005. The Foley was discontinued
due to a leakage. This was not replaced given good urine output ,
continued pink-colored urine , and no clots. The patient's
hematocrit was stable throughout this.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was given pneumoboots given the new
automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement and
hematuria.
8. Infectious Disease: The patient is to be on clindamycin for
7 days status post pacemaker placement.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol 12.5 mg
p.o. q.d. , clindamycin 300 mg p.o. q.i.d. through May , 2005 ,
digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. and Lasix 40
mg p.o. q.p.m. , hydralazine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , levothyroxine 150
mcg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Ativan 0.5 mg p.o.
q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
insomnia , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. ,
glyburide 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. , magnesium oxide 800 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
and KCl slow release 20 mEq p.o. q.d.
DIET: The patient's diet on discharge; the patient should
measure weight daily; continue a low-cholesterol , low-fat , and
low-sodium diet , ADA 2100 calories per day.
ACTIVITIES: No vigorous activity of the left arm for 1 month and
no lifting of the left arm above the shoulder. The patient
should not drive until a followup appointment.
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: The patient is to see Dr. Isaias Topper
and Landon Ducayne , nurse practitioner. The clinic will call the
patient with his appointment time. The patient is to see Dr.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Aortic valve stenosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 75-year-old gentleman with a
history of coronary artery disease who is status post CABG in
1983 who has recently experienced unstable angina and was
admitted in April of 2006 to Omill Mang Medical Center Of for
workup and was found to have an aortic valve area of 0.8 and
significant vein graft disease to OM1. The patient received
coronary stents to OM1 and the native circumflex at Palclean Center in April of 2006. Of note , the right coronary artery was
seen to be occluded at that time as was the vein graft to that
coronary. The vein graft to the LAD had been priorly stented and
was noted to be patent. The patient began developing shortness
of breath and symptoms of aortic stenosis , which were complicated
by anemia , which was thought to have developed due to some AV
malformations of the foregut. In view of the patient's
progressive symptoms , it was decided to proceed with aortic valve
replacement , which was first scheduled for September , but then
rescheduled when the patient was noted to have coughing and
hemoptysis. The patient was treated for pneumonia surgery
rescheduled and he is admitted to Ingfrisdam Rywilf Health
for reoperation aortic valve replacement.

hypotensive following surgery , which was refractory to pressors
and volume requiring pressor boluses and transient application of
chest compressions and the patient underwent placement of an
intraaortic balloon pump. The balloon pump was weaned and
removed by postoperative day 2 and pressors were weaned by
postoperative day 3. The patient transferred to the Step-Down
Unit later on postoperative day #3 and continued to progress
daily. His diet was advanced to full house diet and was well
tolerated. The patient was started on beta-blockade , aspirin and
statin for his coronary artery disease and a course of
antibiotics was completed for a preoperative urinary tract
infection The patient was followed perioperatively by the
Diabetes Management Service for tight glycemic control. The
patient was weaned off of supplemental oxygen with ongoing
diuresis and he remained in sinus rhythm and saturated well on
room air for the remainder of his stay. The patient's
preoperative Flomax was restarted following the removal of Foley
catheter. The patient initially had difficulty voiding and then
voided without difficulty. He has been instructed to follow up
with his home neurologist within the next few weeks and earlier
if he has difficulties. The remainder of his postoperative stay
was uncomplicated and he is discharged to Rehab in good condition

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Eric Christinsen is a 79-year-old gentleman with extensive history of
coronary artery disease who has previously undergone a coronary
artery bypass graft x2. Also , several percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasties and stents of his saphenous vein graft to
his first diagonal coronary artery in 1999. He also received a
stent to his left subclavian due to total occlusion and a stent
and angioplasty of the left brachial artery. He has a history of
atrial fibrillation , chronic renal failure , peripheral vascular

exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and more frequent episodes
of substernal chest pressure. Aortic valve area had reached the
value of 0.4 cm2. During her previous admission in September 2005 ,
he underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed left main
coronary artery disease and three vessels with evidence of
restenosis. At that time , he underwent successful stenting to
his left main coronary artery and a successful PTCA and stenting
two saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending coronary
artery. Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50% ,
aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 23 mmHg , a peak gradient

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Alex Chumley was brought to the operating room on 1/14/05 where he
underwent an elective reoperation aortic valve replacement with a
23 mm Mosaic valve. Total bypass time was 119 minutes , total
crossclamp time was 69 minutes. Intraoperatively , the patient
was cannulated via the right axillary artery and left femoral
vein. A sternotomy was performed while on coronary pulmonary
bypass without incident. He was found to have a trileaflet
calcified aortic valve , which was excised after transverse
aortotomy. The patient did well intraoperatively , came off
bypass without incident , was brought up to the Intensive Care
Unit in normal sinus rhythm and stable condition.
Postoperatively , the patient did very well. He was extubated and
transferred to Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #1. He did
receive transfusion of 2 units packed red blood cells for
postoperative anemia. His Plavix , aspirin and Coumadin was
restarted for his atrial fibrillation. Heath Uren was also found
to have an air leak from his chest tube and also did begin to
have some postoperative confusion on postoperative day #2. His
narcotics were discontinued. His chest tube air leak resolved ,
and the chest tubes were removed without incident. Post-pull
chest x-ray showed no pneumothorax. On postoperative day #3 , the
patient continued with his confusion requiring a sitter.
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended to restart his
preoperative benzodiazepine and Haldol in the evening. He was

diabetes , obesity with ICD/biventricular pacer , CHF with EF of
15% was admitted to an outside hospital initially for a fall and
was subsequently found to have decompensated heart failure and
hyponatremia. The patient was then transferred to Memoff Deelaen's Hospital for further treatment. At the time of the fall , the
patient was not presyncopal , likely due to possibly feeling weak.
At the hospital , the patient received p.o. Lasix and then IV
Lasix with little success in treating CHF. The patient was found
to have sodium level of 117 , hydrochlorothiazide was then
withheld and the patient was restricted on fluids. Of note , the
patient comes in on Coumadin therapy secondary to having a CVA in
10/5 with no residual symptoms while off Coumadin. The

HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 65-year-old female with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy ,
CHF with EF of 15% and on a biventricular pacer , ICD , diabetes ,
obesity , admitted from outside hospital for treatment of
hyponatremia and decompensated heart failure.
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Pump: The patient initially was in significant decompensated
heart failure. As a result , the patient was immediately started
on diuretics with torsemide IV 100 mg twice a day with a goal of
-1 to -2 liters daily. Daily weights and strict I & Os were
monitored daily. The patient was also placed on 1 liter free
water restriction and 2 liters fluid restriction. Digoxin levels
were shown to be in normal range. The patient was continued on
digoxin , Isordil , and thiazides were held secondary to patient's
hyponatremia. Over the hospital course , the patient's
hyponatremia improved significantly and gradually back up in to
the 130s. The patient continued to diurese well initially with a
weight of 83.5 kilograms. At the time of discharge , the
patient's weight was approximately 273 kilograms. The patient
also continued to show much improvement in terms of energy level.
Subjectively , the patient felt better. Zestril was also slowly
added to patient's CHF regimen. At the time of discharge ,
Zestril 10 mg per day was added. A beta-blocker was also added ,
specifically Coreg at 3.125 mg twice daily , Aldactone 25 mg once
daily was also added to the regimen. In terms of diuresis
initially , the patient was on 100 mg b.i.d. p.o. torsemide and at
one point was switched to Lasix drip as the patient was not
responding to diuretics. Eventually the patient was transitioned
back to an oral regimen with torsemide ultimately at 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d.
Echocardiogram was also performed which showed significant mitral
regurgitation with reversal of flow in the pulmonary venous
system. As a result , there was consideration and discussion
about mitral valve replacement. The patient is amenable to
procedure performed by Dr. Mcgrue This will be discussed and
coordinated by his office and him. This will be a percutaneous
procedure possibly.
The patient's electrolytes were monitored twice daily as the
patient was actively being diuresed. Electrolytes were repleted
p.r.n.
B. Rhythm: The patient has no active arrhythmias. However , the
patient's ICD and biventricular pacemaker was found to be towards
end of life and required replacement. As a result , although not
urgent during this admission , ICD/biventricular pacer was
replaced by Dr. Neuse on 4/20/05. The patient tolerated the
procedure very well with no complications. The patient's ICD
pocket was checked for any signs of pocket hematoma or other
complications. The patient is stable and new ICD/pacer is
functioning properly. No signs of bleeding or infection.
C. Ischemia: There are no active issues. EKGs demonstrated no
signs of cardiac ischemia. The patient was chest pain free
throughout the hospitalization.
2. Endocrine: The patient's home regimen was held and the
patient was continued only on a insulin sliding scale after meals
and at bedtime. Fingersticks demonstrated good sugar control.
Fingersticks were managed mostly between 100 and 120.
3. FEN: The patient was on diabetic diet. The patient was also
checked twice daily for electrolytes and repleted for magnesium
and potassium scale. Sodium was also monitored as the patient
was initially admitted for hyponatremia. As a result , all
thiazides were held.
4. Hematology: The patient had a home dose of Coumadin 5 mg
Monday , Wednesday , Friday. The patient's regimen was continued
as inpatient and was slightly modified eventually to
approximately 2 to 2.5 mg once daily. INR was maintained
therapeutic throughout the hospitalization. ICD replacement
procedure per Dr. Bjella The patient was continued with the
foal INR between 2.0 to 2.5.
5. Psyche/Neuro: Continued patient's home regimen of Xanax ,
Neurontin and pain medication to control chronic back pain.
6. Prophylaxis: For DVT prophylaxis , the patient was on Coumadin
with therapeutic INR. For GI prophylaxis , the patient was placed
on Nexium.
Physical therapy consult was also called to evaluate the
patient's functional status. The patient also underwent regular
physical therapy sessions inhouse to improve functional status.
ID: The patient's UA demonstrated possible evidence for urinary
tract infection. This may also have contributed to patient's
decompensated heart failure and also initial complaints of
feeling weak. Urine culture demonstrated that the patient had
citrobacter that was sensitive to ciprofloxacin. As a result ,
the patient was started on a course of ciprofloxacin. The
patient was also placed in isolation as the strain was resistant
to gentamicin. The patient after treatment was taken off contact
isolation. The patient was afebrile. Vital signs were stable
with no complaints of dysuria , chills , or fevers throughout
hospitalization. Subsequent UA demonstrated evidence that
urinary tract infection was adequately treated.
DISPOSITION:
The patient to follow up with home cardiologist within one to two
weeks. After discharge , the patient will also follow up with Dr.
Iturbe to discuss further treatment of mitral valve
regurgitation. After Coumadin follow up and INR blood draws , the
patient will follow up with primary care doctor.

ATTENDING: KEVIN DEPIPPO MD
PRIMARY MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:
Congestive heart failure.
OTHER MEDICAL DIAGNOSES:
Morbid obesity , hypothyroidism , hypertension , history of poor
adherence to medical regimen.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with medical history as
mentioned above and history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy with her
last echocardiogram in 6/22 showing ejection fraction of 35-45%.
She presents with approximately 1.5 weeks of increasing
shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. The patient denies
chest pain , fevers or chills but does say that she has had sore
throat and a cough for approximately one week. The cough is
productive of clear frothy sputum. The patient reports
compliance with most of her medicines but states that she is not
taking Synthroid and lisinopril because these medications make
her feel bad. She also reports eating submarine sandwiches for
the past week secondary to difficulty shopping and doing her
cooking at home. She does not measure her daily weights. She
states that in addition to the Synthroid and lisinopril , she is
unsure of her other medical regimen as she has run out of some of
her medicines at home.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
As above.
ALLERGIES:
Ampicillin causes a rash.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient has two adult children at home and reports that she
drinks approximately 1/2-1 pint of ethanol over 2-3 days and
binges that occur approximately two times per month.
ADMISSION DATA:
Vital signs: Temperature 97 , pulse 76 , blood pressure 150s/80s.
note that one read with a small cuff read a blood pressure of
200/100 , this was believed to be secondary to inefficient cuff
size. Oxygen saturation 94% on room air. In general , the
patient is morbidly obese , in no acute distress , slowly
responsive to questions with frequent staring episodes. HEENT
exam was significant for mild pharyngeal erythema without
exudates. Neck exam was significant for no lymphadenopathy.
Jugular venous pressure was elevated although it is difficult to
assess secondary to body habitus. Lungs showed clear breath
sounds although a few crackles were present at the left base.
Abdomen was morbidly obese but did have active bowel sounds and
was nontender. Extremities showed significant subcutaneous fatty
tissue , however , there was no pitting edema. Extremities were
warm throughout. Dermatologic exam was significant for dry skin
and thin eyebrows. Neuro exam revealed 3+ biceps reflexes
bilaterally. There was a question of slow relaxation phase.
Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary redistribution. EKG was
unchanged from prior , and showed normal sinus rhythm with a first
degree AV block , left axis deviation , left ventricular
hypertrophy with poor R-wave progression and nonspecific T-wave
abnormalities.
Laboratory values on admission was significant for creatinine of
0.8 , D-dimer was negative at 306 , BNP 2. White blood cell 6.9 ,
hematocrit 43.6 , platelets 170 , 000 , magnesium 1.7 , potassium 3.2 ,
INR 0.9 , PTT 29.3.
INITIAL IMPRESSION:
This is a 58-year-old woman with morbid obesity , dilated
cardiomyopathy and hypothyroidism in the setting of poor medical
compliance , admitted with likely multifactorial dyspnea on
exertion and mild congestive heart failure and decompensation.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Pump: The patient presented with an elevated JVP in the setting
of a negative BNP. However the clinical exam was more consistent
with mild failure and the patient was diuresed with 80 mg of IV
Lasix. She responded to this dose with good urine output and
stable renal function test. However , secondary to stress
incontinence and difficulty measuring JVP , the patient was
slightly over diuresed while inhouse resulting in an increasing
BUN to creatinine ratio. On her final day of her
hospitalization , all diuretics were held and the patient was
discharged on her usual regimen of diuretics including Lasix 80
mg once per day. The patient had been noncompliant with her
lisinopril secondary to throat symptoms and reportedly some
lightheadedness. Therefore she was changed to Cozaar 50 mg at
the time of discharge. The patient's discharge weight was 141.5
kg and this was estimated to be dry weight for the patient at
this time.
Rhythm: The patient had first degree AV block that was stable
from old EKGs. She was monitored on telemetry throughout her
hospital stay. There were no significant events on telemetry
during this hospitalization.
Ischemia: Rule out MI protocol was initiated in the ED secondary
to vague symptoms. This was continued and the patient ruled out
with serial negative cardiac enzymes x 3. there was no
suggestion of ischemic by ECG criteria as well.
2. Endocrine: The patient has a long history of noncompliance
with her thyroid hormone replacement and was clearly hypothyroid
on this admission. However , secondary to difficulty with blood
draws , thyroid function tests that were ordered were not obtained
on this admission and should be obtained as an outpatient in the
near future. the patient was encouraged to continue taking her
thyroid medicine as this may help improve her overall functional
status in addition to her cardiomyopathy.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. , potassium chloride
20 mEq p.o. q.d. , Prozac 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Ventolin 2 puffs
aerosol as needed , levothyroxine 225 mcg p.o. q.d. , multivitamin tablet
p.o. q.d. , Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Flonase 1-2 puffs in the
nose twice a day , Advair Diskus one puff twice a day , Aldactone
one tablet p.o. q.d. , atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
FOLLOWUP PLANS:
The patient will have a followup in SNOWEST HOSPITAL clinic with her primary
care provider , the day following discharge , since Wednesday
8/6/05. at this time , routine chem-7 can be obtained to
evaluate for improvement in renal function and electrolyte
status. The patient will followup with her cardiologist , Dr.
Roik at her regularly scheduled intervals. Tests pending at the
time of discharge , the patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram
performed which is pending at the time of this dictation. The
patient is discharged to home with services in good condition.

8. Penicillin.
PREVIOUS STUDIES:
1. Echocardiogram 7/7/2005: Ejection fraction 65-70% , mild
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , aortic valve was
thickened , stenotic , peak gradient 58 ( mean 33 ) , AVA 0.74 , mild
mitral regurgitation , mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation
( regurgitant velocity 3.2 m/s , pulmonary artery systolic pressure
40+ right atrial pressure ) , trace-to-mild pulmonic regurgitation.
2. Pulmonary function test 2/8/2006: FVC 31% , FEV1 23
percent , FEV1/FVC 77%.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On admission , 5/25/2006 , the patient's weight on admission was
130 kg. Her vital signs are as follows , temperature 95.8 , pulse
67 in atrial fibrillation , blood pressure 126/Doppler , the
patient had respiratory rate of 20 and an O2 saturation 95% on 4
liters. In general , the patient was in no acute distress ,
speaking in full sentences. Examination of the neck revealed JVP
to the ear , weak/weight carotid upstrokes , no bruits.
Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregular rhythm with an
S1 and weak S2. A 4/6 crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur was
heard best at the right upper sternal border radiating to the
carotids. Lung examination revealed crackles that heard at the
way up bilaterally with decreased breath sounds throughout. The
patient's abdomen was obese , but soft and nontender. Examination
of her extremities revealed a parvus at tardus. Lower extremity
pulses could not be palpated due to edema. The patient had 4+
lower extremity edema. Examination of the left shin showed
erythema , pain , swelling with a 2 x 2 cm ulcer on the left
anterior shin. The ulcer appeared clean , dry and intact with no
drainage.
STUDIES AT OUAH:
1. EKG on 5/25/2006 showed atrial fibrillation at 63 beats per
minute with a normal axis and poor R-wave progression.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. The patient presented in gross volume overload: We attempted
to diurese the patient with intravenous torsemide. Gradually ,
the dose of torsemide was increased from 100 twice a day to 200
twice a day. At the time of this dictation; however , the
patient's weight had decreased only to 124.6 kg. Her admission
weight on 7/15/2006 was 130 kg. However , this weight was
recorded in the bed ( not standing ). Her first standing weight
was recorded on 8/19/2006 at 125 kg. Her lower extremity edema
only mildly improved , however , at the time of this dictation , the
patient was able to put her shoes on , which she was unable to do
prior to admission. During this diuresis , the patient's
potassium was repleted twice a day. She was also maintained on
Aldactone and acetazolamide ( for elevated CO2 levels ). The
patient's lipid profile was measured during this hospitalization
and she had an LDL of 64. She was maintained on Zocor. Aspirin
cannot be administered due to the patient's drug allergy profile.
From a rhythm standpoint , the patient remained in atrial
fibrillation during this hospitalization through 5/18/2006. She
was not anticoagulation , given her history of HIT and history of
gastrointestinal bleed on Coumadin.
2. Pulmonary: The patient was maintained on BiPAP and Flonase
throughout her hospitalization. Her mental status was monitored
closely given her previous MICU stay during her last admission
for an elevated pCO2. However , the patient was alert and
oriented x3 during her hospitalization.
3. Renal: The patient's creatinine was stable at approximately
1.1 during her diuresis through 10/30/2006.
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was maintained on Nexium
during her hospitalization. Her hematocrit remained stable at
approximately 32.4.
5. Endocrinology: The patient was maintained on Levoxyl and her
home NPH regimen.
6. Infectious disease: The patient was given vancomycin for
cellulitis on her left shin , which appeared to be improving as
the erythematous area was decreasing from 5/4/206 to
10/30/2006. She was also started on gentamicin on 10/11/2006 for
asymptomatic bacteriuria. The patient's urine culture on
8/19/2006 greater than 100 , 000 colonies of pseudomonas.
CODE STATUS: During this hospitalization , the patient reiterated
that she is a full code. It was discussed with her that she is
difficult and in fact possibly and possible intubation. She was
one time intubated nasally. In any event , she wants all life
saving measures performed. At the time of this dictation , she is
a full code ( healthcare proxy Harry Behran , phone number ( 860 ) 377-5068 ).

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Congestive heart failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation , and atrial
fibrillation.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Chest pain x 3 months and shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 75-year-old female with no previous cardiac disease who
presented this morning with chest pain and shortness of breath ,
which had been limiting her over the last month. She had
gastrointestinal surgery earlier this year , complicated by need
for wound infection with revision and debridement.
Before her surgery , she could walk 20 minutes every morning , and
was very active. Over the last month , she has been limited by
shortness of breath , substernal chest pressure , and an overall
decrease in exercise tolerance. She cannot walk across the room
without difficulty now. The pressure in her chest is
nonradiating , is like a pressure rather than sharp , comes
unpredictably with exertion , and is relieved by rest. The
shortness of breath accompanies the pain. The symptoms have been
becoming more severe , and last night , she had rest shortness of
breath and chest pain. This morning she came to the emergency
department because her visiting nurse for her wound care told her
she looked worse and more short of breath and that she should
come to the hospital. She has never had chest pain or shortness
of breath until a little over a month ago , but does take
beta-blockers for a few isolated episodes of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia that she had during her surgery
admission. She sleeps on two pillows every night , which is
chronic but does not get short of breath when flat. She denies
PND , palpitations , weight gain , swelling , or syncopal episodes.
She is a nonsmoker , nondiabetic without high cholesterol that she
knows of. Her chest pain is 2/10 upon admission to the emergency
department and is now 0/10 with nitroglycerin. In the emergency
room , she was given heparin , Plavix , aspirin , beta-blocker ,
Plavix 300 , and oxygen.
REVIEW OF SYSTEM:
She does not have any gastrointestinal symptoms. Her pain is
unrelated to eating. She has no cough , sputum production , and no
history of blood clots. She does not have calf pain , and she has
no neurologic symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Status post bowel resection for diverticulitis , status post
ileostomy take down in 7/21 , status post closure of wound
8/19/04 , and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during last
hospitalization.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Brother with angina at age less than 55.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs: Afebrile , heart rate 83 , blood pressure 113/72 ,
respirations of 18 , and saturation 98% on room air. In general ,
the patient was sitting up comfortable , in no acute distress ,
breathing comfortably. Coronary exam: Regular rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2. Slight murmur diastolic in the axilla. Heart
sounds were distant. Jugular venous pressure at 8 cm.
Pulmonary: Faint crackles inferiorly bilaterally superior 2/3rd
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal exam: Positive
bowel sounds. Wound was covered , some small amount of drainage

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient was thought to have acute coronary
syndrome and was sent to have a left heart catheterization. At
catheterization , she was found to have a large dyskinetic heart and
severe mitral regurgitation but no angiographically significant
coronary artery disease.
Cardiovascular/pump: Echocardiogram on hospital day 2 showed mild to
moderate left ventricular enlargement with moderate mitral
regurgitation and left atrial enlargement. There was only mild
structural mitral valve disease with MAC and leaflet thickening. Left
ventricular systolic function was moderately to severely impaired.
Management for congestive heart failure was pursued with the intention to
reassess LV size , function and MR after optimizing medical therapy. We
began diuresis at this time with 40 mg of IV Lasix. The patient came in
at 64 kilograms and discharge weight and dry weight is 58.0 kilograms.
The patient was also started on ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker as well as
q.d. p.o. Lasix.
Rhythm: The patient developed atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter during this hospitalization with rapid ventricular
response. Heart rate was often into the 150s-160s. We were able
to eventually obtain control with Toprol XL 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,
diltiazem p.o. 30 mg t.i.d. , which was then converted to 45 mg
b.i.d. for an outpatient dosing. The patient was also started on
Coumadin while in hospital. She will follow up in Coumadin
Clinic. The day after discharge , she will have labs drawn to
check her INR. She will be on Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous b.i.d.
until INR becomes therapeutic.
2. Wound care: The patient has open abdominal wound
approximately 2 cm x 2 cm that is followed by Dr. Schoolman , Neville Surgery came by to see Mrs. Lenix in hospital and made
recommendations for wound care. CT scan showed no evidence of entero-
cutaneous fistula. The patient will get follow up wound care at home with
visiting nurses.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
1. Tobacco , 80-pack-year history , quit in 1990.
2. No alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for temperature of
99.2 , heart rate of 121 in sinus tachycardia , blood pressure
116/60 , saturating 98% on room air. She was noted to have a 2/6
systolic murmur at the apex. Lungs were clear bilaterally.
Pulse exam showed no palpable femoral pulses and biphasic
dopplerable pulses bilaterally , DP and PT. Extremities showed
bilateral mottling of all toes and an open 0.5 cm ulceration at
the base of the left fourth toe. All toes are exquisitely tender
to palpation. Sensation is decreased but equal bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This 75-year-old female vasculopath was
admitted for further evaluation of her peripheral vascular
disease which was suspected to be contributing to her new
ulcerations and progressively worsening wrist pain as an
exacerbating factor to likely atheroembolic phenomenon , status
post coronary catheterizations earlier in the year. She was
placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics and plan was made for an MRA
to evaluate her anatomy. Unfortunately , the patient was unable
to tolerate the MR and did experience some mental status changes
that prevented further noninvasive imaging , when she received
some narcotic following her hemodialysis round. Over the ensuing
days she required rather significant doses of Zyprexa and Haldol
to contain agitation and delirium , as the patient would also get
physical and violent. This appeared to sedate her sufficiently
and over the following days , she did manage to calm significantly
and returned to her baseline mental status. She did appear very
emotionally labile throughout the rest of her stay and incredibly
remorseful for previous events. On 6/28/2006 , she was offered
an angiogram to delineate aortic and bilateral lower extremity
runoff anatomy. She did tolerate this well under simple IV
conscious sedation. This showed chronic disease with
collateralization and very poor inflow to the bilateral feet with
essentially one vessel run off on either side. After extensive
discussions with the patient and the patient's family , the
patient did agree to a left femoral to dorsalis pedis bypass
graft which was performed on 9/22/2006 without complication.
Please see the operative note for further details. The patient
did tolerate the procedure well. By time of discharge , she was
tolerating a regular diet and ambulating at baseline with her
rolling walker. The pain was well controlled with minimal
analgesics that were not narcotic based. Cardiology was
consulted during this time to optimize her prior to the OR. Her
primary cardiologist , Dr. Fugle did make some recommendations
including an echocardiogram that showed preserved ejection
fraction and no wall motion abnormalities. Her beta blockade was
titrated up and she was instructed to follow up with cardiology.
She did tolerate hemodialysis throughout this time without undue
difficulty. She did on one occasion experience dyspnea following
hemodialysis that resolved of its own accord , no cardiac events
or in evidence by EKG or by following cardiac enzymes. As the
patient was in stable condition and back to her baseline level of
activity with very strong support at home , she was discharged to
home with services for wound checks and home safety evaluation.
She was instructed to follow up with Dr. Sedlachek in one to two
weeks.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Touchdown weightbearing on the left heel. The patient should
not keep legs in dependent position for more than 10 minutes at a
time. She was to use the walker and a cane as instructed by

Discharge Date: 10/7/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY.
PROBLEM LIST: 1 ) CARDIOMYOPATHY.
2 ) STATUS POST MULTIPLE INJURIES.
3 ) HISTORY OF HEPATITIS B.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 42 year-old gentleman
with dilated cardiomyopathy with
worsening functional status. He was admitted for transplant
work-up , right heart catheterization and optimization of his
medical treatment. He initially developed symptoms approximately
six years prior to admission with complaints of dyspnea and
orthopnea. His chest x-ray at that time demonstrated cardiomegaly
and ultimately an echocardiogram demonstrated dilated
cardiomyopathy. In 1992 , a catheterization was performed with
clean coronary arteries by report. In February of 1994 , he had a
""cerebrovascular accident"". He was on Coumadin at that time. His
symptoms included right hand and face anesthesia and hemiplegia
which lasted only a few seconds and were self resolved. A CT was
negative by report. He was started on Coumadin subsequently. In
February of 1994 , he had an echocardiogram which demonstrated a
left ventricular end diastolic diameter of 6.2 cm and ejection
fraction of 20%. There was no thrombus seen. There was 2+ mitral
regurgitation. There were no regional wall motion abnormalities.
He was doing fairly well at home with medical management without
any admissions for congestive heart failure until earlier this
year. He began to have worsening symptoms following a viral
illness in October of 1997. At that time an echocardiogram in
October of 1997 demonstrated a probably left ventricular thrombus
and ejection fraction of 12%. His Lasix dose was increased and his
Atenolol dose was decreased. He improved and in October of 1997 , he
was able to participate in activities such as sledding and skating
with only occasional chest pressure and dyspnea on exertion. In
October of 1997 , an exercise tolerance test was performed which he
went 11 minutes. Maximum heart rate was 148. His rate pressure
product was 18 , 000 and the peak oxygen consumption was 20.4. At
the time nitrates were added to his regimen. His Atenolol was
increased. However , nitrates were discontinued because of headache
and insomnia. Now , over the prior one to two months , proceeding
admission , he has had worsening symptoms with orthopnea , dyspnea on
minimal exertion with less than one flight of stairs , decreased
appetite. His weight is stable , but it is felt to be a decrease in
the body amount with an increase in fluid weight. He has nocturnal
shortness of breath and dyspnea. There is no syncope. He was seen
by Dr. Parker Willy and was felt to be at that time a class four
on the Thyna 1 , Cuse , Nebraska 41604 . His Lasix was increased and he
was referred for admission.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for orthopnea as well as paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea four out of seven nights.
There is no nocturia. His exercise tolerance is approximately one
flight of stairs with moderate shortness of breath. He complains
of nausea and anorexia without vomiting. He also has insomnia and
erectile difficulties. He has a 6 lb. weight loss over the week
prior to admission following an increase in outpatient diuretic
use. His baseline weight was 175 lbs. One month ago , it was 165
lbs. and the day of admission , it is 155 lbs.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for cardiomyopathy as above , gunshot
wound to his chest and head at the age of 14
and motor vehicle accident , Hepatitis B. He has had four
colonoscopies in the past and has had no polyps.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for appendectomy and a ganglion
cyst in his right wrist.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Enalapril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )
Atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. 5 )
Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day. 6 ) Kay Ciel 10 mg p.o. q. day. 7 )
Multivitamins one p.o. q. day.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a sales representative for a food broker.
He lives with his wife and three daughters in
Y He was a former smoker who quit in 1984. Previously , he
had smoked one to two packs per day for twelve years. He continues
to use alcohol and drinks approximately six beers per week.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father is 70 years old. His mother is 68. He
has a sister with colon polyps and a brother who
is healthy. His family history is otherwise notable for familial
colon cancer and polyposis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Weight 72 kg , afebrile , heart
rate 78 , blood pressure 95/71 , respiratory
rate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air. HEENT is
normocephalic , atraumatic. Oropharynx revealed multiple fillings ,
but there is no abnormality. His neck is supple with no
thyromegaly , carotid bruits or jugular venous distension. His
jugular venous pressure is 6 cm. His chest is clear. His cardiac
examination is regular rate and rhythm with an S3 as well as right
ventricular impulse palpable and audible. His abdomen was soft ,
non-tender with normal active bowel sounds. He had no bruits. His
liver is 12-14 cm and 1 cm below the right costal margin. There
are no masses. His extremities were warm and well perfused.
Neurological examination revealed a mild right facial asymmetry ,
but otherwise , his neurological examination is non-focal.
LABORATORY: Laboratory evaluation on admission was notable for a
sodium of 133 , creatinine 1.2. Liver function tests
are notable for a bilirubin of 1.7 and 0.7. His complete blood
count is unremarkable. His INR was 1.4. His urinalysis was
unremarkable. Pulmonary function tests on admission included an
FVC of 81% of predicted and FEV1 of 78% of predicted and an
FEV1/FVC ratio of 97% of predicted. His DLCO is 90% of predicted.
EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm at 80 with first degree
atrioventricular block. His PR interval is 0.226. His QRS
interval is 0.10 and his QTC is 0.401. There was a left anterior
hemi-block. His axis is -49 degrees. There was left atrial
enlargement. There was poor R-wave progression. There were
flipped T-waves across the precordium. There was an increase in
left atrial size since October of 1997 , otherwise no acute changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 42 year-old gentleman with idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy now presented with
worsening functional status over the past few months as well as
recent fluid overload necessitating increase in Lasix. There was a
question of patient non-compliance especially given his current
alcohol use which raises the question of psychologic readiness for
cardiac transplant at this time. Following admission , the patient
underwent a right heart catheterization which demonstrated right
atrial pressure of 7 , right ventricular pressure of 55/12 , PA
pressures of 58/32 , mean wedge pressure of 30 , arterial pressure at
the time was 113/74 with a mean of 90. Additionally , by Fick , his
cardiac output was 2.85 with a cardiac index of 1.49 , pulmonary
venous resistance of 280 and a systemic venous resistance of 2 , 330.
Because of this markedly high SVR and a borderline PVR , he was
started on intravenous nitrates with intravenous Nitroprusside with
a significant decrease in his SVR as well as his PA pressures.
This was felt to be a significant enough reduction in his pressures
to suggest that he would be a successful transplant candidate.
Therefore , he was transitioned to oral nitrates and started on
Isordil by mouth. However , he developed intolerance to nitrates
with severe headaches and ultimately all nitrates were
discontinued. He was subsequently managed only on afterload
reduction. His Analopril was held and he was started on Captopril
which was titrated up with good maintenance of his decrease in
pressure. Additionally , he was started on Losartan for further
afterload reduction which he tolerated well without orthostatic
symptoms. His Lasix was gradually increased and he continued to
have quite a significant improvement symptomatically with no
further orthopnea in the hospital. Further parts of the cardiac
transplant work-up were undertaken including PPD and controls which
were placed. There was no reaction to either PPDs or controls at
72 hours. He had a B12 and folate level drawn which were within
normal limits. His thyroid function test demonstrated a TSH of 1.9
and all other parameters were within normal limits. Digoxin level
on discharge was maintained in a therapeutic range. Hepatitis
panel was sent and he was negative for Hepatitis B antigen or
antibody as well as Hepatitis C antibodies. 24 hour urine
collection was obtained for creatinine and his creatinine clearance
was at 88 at 24 hours. Pulmonary function tests were as noted
above. He was seen by Dental Consult and was felt to have a few
minor restorative needs which could be taken care of by his
outpatient dentist , but he was dentally cleared otherwise for a
transplant. Subsequent to his medical changes and his transplant
work-up , he was restarted on his Coumadin and was discharged when
his INR had become greater than 2 with a target range of 2 to 2.5
planned. Echocardiogram was performed on October , 1997 which
demonstrated 1+ tricuspid regurgitation , 2+ mitral regurgitation ,
severely dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 20%.
There was diffuse severe hypokinesis and apical akinesis. There
was evidence of echo contrast within the left ventricle suggesting
a clot. There was moderate left atrial enlargement.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition. He was markedly improved from
a symptomatic point of view on discharge.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Royce Mcumber in
the Tho Medical Center

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a pleasant 78-year-old gentleman who presents with
shortness of breath and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for
approximately three weeks. He has a history of coronary artery
disease with an MI in 1994 and four-vessel CABG with subsequently
placed five stents in 2002 for graft and native vessel stenosis ,
hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline
creatinine of 2.8 , diabetes mellitus ( insulin dependent ) ,
hyperlipidemia , and a pace maker for symptomatic bradycardia. He
is presented with three weeks of increasing orthopnea , dyspnea ,
and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with rare chest tightness
without radiation and onset of symptoms mainly while recumbent.
He presents after coming to an outside hospital with three to
four days of these worsening symptoms. He was transferred to
Baspit Hospital where he received most of his
cardiac care. The patient had these worsening heart failure
symptoms after a trip to I Hwy , Ny Vale , Michigan 34152 , some dietary indiscretion and
a five-pound weight gain. He has had no syncope , palpitations ,
but has had some mild nausea without emesis. At the outside
hospital when he presented , his EKG showed a baseline left
bundle-branch block and had a troponin of 0.13. He was given
some Lasix and had echocardiogram , had initially revealed an
ejection fraction of 35%. He was transferred to Me Ale Firstray Hospital , started on a nitroglycerin drip as well as a
heparin drip for presumed coronary artery disease , a repeat
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 50% , anterior wall
distal dyskinesis from an old myocardial infarction and
moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. This is consistent with
an echocardiogram that he received in 1/8 . Upon
presentation , the patient was afebrile , had a heart rate of 82 ,
blood pressure of 138/64 and was sating 96% on 5 liters of nasal
canula. His jugular venous pressure was 7 cm. His lungs had
rales bilaterally , approximately half way up. He had no
dullness. His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6
holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the left
axilla. He had no S3 , and no S4. His abdomen was mildly
distended. He had no fluid waves and positive bowel sounds. His
extremities were warm. He had no pedal edema and 1+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally. EKG at Baneers Hospital
revealed a dual chamber pacemaker with left bundle-branch pattern
and no significant ST wave changes and an occasional PVC.
ADMISSION LABORATORIES:
Significant for a creatinine of 3.1 , a BUN of 76 , potassium of
5.3 , his hematocrit was 29.4 , and PT-T was 56 on heparin drip.
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Ischemia. The patient has an extensive history of coronary
artery disease. He is maintained on aspirin , Plavix , low dose
beta-blocker with carvedilol as well as ACE inhibitor and statin.
He initially came in with a troponin of 0.13 , which was felt as
demand ischemia related to systemic hypertension and pulmonary
hypertension. His enzymes trended down and were negative after
the initial check. Eventually , the patient received 48 hours of
intravenous heparin as well as IV nitroglycerin and was chest
pain free. At this point , he received an Adenosine MIBI nuclear
study , which revealed a known distal anterior wall scar with a
very small surrounding region of reversible ischemia that was
felt to be nonrevascularizable. He was maintained on optimum
medical management with the caveat that cardiac catheterization
in this gentleman who had already had previous history of renal
dysfunction with a creatinine rise to nearly 7 with a dye load
was not warranted nor indicated at this time. By discharge , he
was ambulating halls and was chest tightness free. Coronary
artery disease was felt to be a noncontributory factor to his CHF
exacerbation.
2. Pump. The patient had an ejection fraction of 45% upon
admission with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. He was
initially diuresed approximately 3 liters with a combination of
Lasix and Natrecor. At this point , his pulmonary edema had
resolved and his oxygen requirement was decreased. Given the
fact of his tenuous renal status , we wanted to avoid further
diuresis or after-load reduction until we knew exactly what his
right and left heart filling pressures were. The patient was
taken to the Cardiovascular Diagnostic Laboratory and received a
right heart catheterization. His pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was determined to be 16 and his pulmonary artery
pressure 56/18. His RA pressure was 8. There was some initial
false elevation because of inadequate sedation while in the cath
lab , and the patient was transferred for 48 hours of tailored
therapy to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a pulmonary artery
catheter in place. At this point , his after-load reduction was
maximized with combination of hydralazine and Isordil with good
effect. His creatinine decreased with after-load reduction to
2.7. His symptoms improved and we were able to diurese another 2
liters of the patient. By discharge , the patient was actually
becoming hypertensive again and he was started on amlodipine , a
calcium channel blocker , which he has tolerated in the past. Of
note , the patient has been exposed to ACE inhibition in the past
and is currently not on an ACE inhibitor. In the past , he had
had a rise in his potassium to 5.5 on ACE inhibition. On an
outpatient basis in the future , we would suggest the patient have
a trial of ACE or ARB to optimize his after-load reduction and
neurohormonal activation with his heart failure. The patient's
heart failure regimen includes standing Lasix , carvedilol ,
Isordil and hydralazine , as well as digoxin for symptomatic
improvement.
3. Rhythm. The patient has a dual-chambered pacemaker. He was
maintained on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. His
electrolytes were replete and he is on a low-dose beta-blocker.
He had a few rounds of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia less
than 8 beats every time during his hospital stay. The patient is
not at this time a candidate for resynchronization biventricular
pacer therapy because his ejection fraction of 45% , even if his
QRS interval is greater than 150 ms.
4. Pulmonary. Given the fact that the patient had a normal
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and elevated pulmonary artery
pressures , a brief investigation of pulmonary parenchymal disease
was undertaken. He had a high resolution chest CT , which showed
mild ground glass infiltrate at the bases consistent with
pulmonary edema and no evidence of interstitial process. He also
had pulmonary function tests. Pulmonary function tests revealed
an FVC of 1.88 liters and an FEV1 of 1.33 liters. This gives an
FEV1 to FVC percent of 71%. He has both decreased FVC and FEV1 ,
but an FEV1 and FVC percent that is most consistent with a mild
restriction. His lung volumes are approximately 50% predicted
suggestive of a restrictive process and his DLCO both corrected
and uncorrected are 50% predicted. His corrected DLCO is 13.5.
It is unclear if the patient has underlying restrictive lung
disease given the absence of definitive interstitial process on
high resolution chest CT. A more likely explanation for these
findings is a residual pulmonary edema relating to inadequate
diuresis with his congestive heart failure. The patient was
sating 98% on room air at the time of discharge.
5. Endocrine. The patient has very difficult to control
diabetes mellitus , and was maintained on both NPH and Lispro
sliding scale while in house. He was briefly hypoglycemic during
his initial hospital course because of a urinary tract infection.
This resolved after approximately 24 hours of holding his
long-acting insulin and giving him glucose replacement therapy.
He was euglycemic on 15 and 10 of NPH in the a.m. and p.m.
respectively as well as a Lispro scale at the time of discharge.
Furthermore , the patient was found to have a TSH of 0.219 as well
as a normal T4 , this is suggestive of clinical hypothyroidism ,
which is consistent with over replacement with Synthroid such as
maintenance Synthroid dose is decreased from 75 mcg to 60.5 mcg
and we recommend a TSH to be checked in late February 2004.
6. Renal. The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency
presumably due to a combination of diabetes and hypertension. He
has had adverse reaction to contrast dye in the past with a
creatinine bump to nearly 7. We wanted to avoid as much contrast
dye as possible during this hospital stay because of his renal
insufficiency. We ended up re-dosing his digoxin to three times
weekly from every other day because of the dig level of 0.19.
His creatinine was 2.7 and falling at the time of discharge and
his BUN was 67. He was making good urine and had no evidence of
residual urinary tract infection.
7. Infectious disease. Upon presentation , the patient after a
Foley was placed became a little delirious and hypoglycemic.
Urine cultures grew out greater than 100 , 000 colonies of Serratia
marcescens and he was given a 14-day course of renally dosed
levofloxacin with good resolution of his symptoms.
8. Neuropsych. The patient has a history of depression and had
some mild delirium in the setting of urinary tract infection ,
which resolved with p.r.n. Zyprexa as well as treating of the
underlying condition. Psychiatric Service was consulted and felt
like he had a resolving medical delirium and there is no
indication for further pharmacal or psychodynamic therapy at this
time. ( His mild subclinical hyperthyroidism may have contributed
to his low mood as apathetic hyperthyroidism in a gentleman of
this age is not uncommon. )
9. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on Nexium for GI
prophylaxis and subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

The patient is full code.
The patient was consulted by both Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy who felt that acute rehabilitation would be
warranted at this time.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: leg swelling
-----
HPI: 71 yo male with h/o DM , HTN , and poss CHF
( pt denies and unclear from documenation ) here with 2 weeks of LE
edema. Of note pt was difficult to obtain a history from and there
is little consistency between his story on admission and what
was recorded by his PCP in his S chart. Pt states he has had
increasing LE swelling for 2 weeks despite taking all of his
medications. Pt states that he has not increased his Na intake
recently. Pt repeatedly denied SOB , increased abd girth , and PND.
Pt did note that he sleeps on 2 pillows at night but his breathing
his fine when he is lying flat.
Next day spoke with patient's wife who confirmed story documented by PCP
including increasing shorntness of breath and orthopnea.
ED: lasix 120 IV x 1 ROS: no fevers , chills , or night sweats. No
ST , hearing problems , or visual problems. No SOB , but
does note non-productive cough x 1 day. No CP , palpitations ,
orthopnea , or PND. No abd pain , N/V , diarrhea , BRBPR. Pt does
endorse nocturia stating that he gets up 6-7 times/night to urinate.
No dysuria or hematuria. No joint pains or rashes.

CONSULTS: Pulmonary Medicine ( Dr. Kohlmeyer )
-----
IMP: 71 yo male with h/o DM , HTN , and poss h/o CHF who presents with
2 weeks of LE edema.
-----
PLAN:
CARDS:
I: No known h/o CAD-little concern for ACS with no sxs except LE
edema -unclear why not on ASA , no h/o GI bleed or ulcer. Will start ASA
for primary/secondary prevention. Checked lipid profile , trigs very
elevated at 482 and HDL 24. LDL could not be peformed b/c trigs were so
high. Started gemfibrozil , pt can have repeat lipid profile as outpt and
statin at discretion of PCP. Pt was continued on BB but dose was
decreased to 50mg po daily as pt having asymptomatic bradycardia to 40's
while sleeping.
P: Pt's OS notes list CHF as dx , pt denies any h/o LE edema or CHF
before 2 weeks ago but is on lasix bid at home. Last echo in 4/3
showed LVH w/ preserved EF. Pt with likely diastolic dysfunction. Pt on
exam has only LE edema , but received 120 IV lasix in ED. Pt's
presentation c/w CHF exacerbation but BNP of 13 is unusual. Continued
to diurese pt with IV lasix and once he was approaching euvolemia
switched him back over to home dose. Pt's LE edema likely multifactorial
due to CHF and some component of chronic venous stasis. LENIs were
checked and were negative for DVTS. Discontinued pt's CCB as may be
contributing to LE edema. Echo was repeated this admit which
showed EF 60-65% and signs of diastolic dysfunction.
HTN: BP was controlled this admit. Pt was continued on BB , norvasc , &
catapres
R: no issues this admit
ENDO: Pt has h/o DM and pt states he is taking insulin at home ( unclear
dose ). Pt was started on Lantus with SS novolog and his sugars were
somewhat elevated. Advised pt to restart home insulin regimen after d/c.
Sent HgA1C but was still pending at the time of discharge.
RENAL: pt appears to have CKD per SHC recs -baseline 1.4-1.6 , renally
dose meds
NEURO: Pt's wife noted that pt has intermittently been confused at home.
She describes episodes when he wakes up at night and doesn't know where
he is. This is likely due to hypoxia as pt has severe sleep apnea and
rarely wears cpap at home. Pt was alert and oriented during this admit.
Sent labs to evaluate for secondary cause of dementia and they were
negative. Suggested that pt f/u with PCP if these episodes persist.
PULM: Pt with h/o sleep apnea. Per 2003 sleep study pt's sleep apnea
was central and not obstructive although this is difficult to believe
based on pt's body habitus and redundant neck tissue. Pt evaluated by
pulmonary after RA ABG showed PaO2 50's. Pt pulse ox was monitored and
when he fell asleep without his cpap he desatted to low 60's and high
50's. Pt satted in mid 90's on RA while awake and upright. Pulmonary
thought pt likely with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea
( central +/- obstructive ). Pt tried on empiric bipap ( 4/9 ) the night
prior to d/c and felt that he slept much better. Of note pt used the
nasal mask in house but has the full mask at home. Tried to set up pt
for home bipap but is not eligible unless has another sleep study.
Communicated this with pt's PCP who will set up repeat sleep study in
near future. Pt also started on empiric qhs acetazolamide per pulmonary
recs based on recent data showing that it improves symptoms in pt's with
central sleep apnea and heart failure.

*************************Hospital Course********************
1.CV ISCH: Elevated ck , tni ( - ) , ckmb low , ruled out X3 cont.
Beta Blocker , ASA , non-occlusive 2vd on cath.
PUMP: warm and wet; the patient was diresed approximately 6 Liters to
her dry weight of 149 kilograms. At dry weight patient had a BNP
of 3700. In house her ACE was switched to Cozaar secondary to cough.
Beta Blocker was changed to once a day Atenolol. An echo on 8/28
revealed EF 21% mV moderate mr , incomplete closure , TV: moderate tr ,
incomplete closure;LV globak HK , rv mildly to moderately decreased ,
incomplete study due to patient not fully cooperating. On the patients
final day in the hospital she was noted to have symptomatic dehydra
tion and was orthostatic - symptoms resoved with a 500 cc NS bolus.
2.ENDO : the patient's insulin regiment was modified and she was dc'd
on insulin 70/30 10 am. THe patient's admission regimine of Lantus 40 q
d was causing both hyper and hypoglycemia in house. Her hospital course
was notable for a few episodes of hypoglycemia resulting in down
titration of insulin AM and PM doses. THe patient was noted to be
extremely hypoglycmeic on 8 units of 70/30 in the PM and the PM
insulin was discontinued for the time being. It was decided that the
patient's diet at home would have higher glucose and carbohydrate
content and her Fs's will need further w/up as outpatient. We reccomend
titrating the 70/30 insulin up as needed.
3.GI: she complained of mild epigastric pain after meals , and said it
is thought that this represents diabetic gastroparesis. Her reglan
dose was increased to 10 and she tolerated PO's better subsequently and
was less symptomatic.
4.HEME: cont coumadin
5.PROPHYLAXIS: coumadin , nexium

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Please followup with Dr. Scarles in 1-2 weeks
2. Please switch your insulin to 10 units of 70/30 insulin the morning.
Your primary doctor may make changes in your insulin regimin
based on your recorded blood sugars.
3. Please stop taking Metoprolol and Lisinopril.
4. Please start taking Cozaar and Atenolol. Your Reglan dose is
increased.
5. VNA for diabetes management , CHF management , and medical compliance.

showed no evidence of a DVT and on 7/18 she had a CT with PE protocol which
showed no evidence of a DVT or PE. She was given mucomyst for this for
renal protection. She was continued on her CPAP for OSA.
2. HTN: The patient was continued on her avapro and Imdur. Her diltiazem
and atenolol doses were decreased as she was having bradycardia with rates
in the 40s on the first day of her hospital stay.
3. CAD: The patient was continued on her imdur , beta blocker , and aspirin.
Her plavix was held as she was holding this as an outpatient for upcoming
cataract surgery. Her last stent was 2001 and she was given permission by
her outpatient cardiologist to hold this.
4. DM: Her avandia and metformin were held and she was continued on her
NPH and a sliding scale.
5. RENAL: Her Cr. was 1.4 at admission and improved to 1.1 with diuresis.
She was given mucomyst for renal protection.
6. FEN: She was maintained on a 2L fluid restriction and 2g Na
restriction.

ATTENDING: OBEY , LAWRENCE MD
SERVICE: Obstetrics/Maternal Fetal Medicine.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pre-gestational diabetes.
2. History of coronary artery disease.
3. Recurrent SABs
4. Hepatitis B.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old G16 ,
P0-0-15-0 , who presented at 6 and 4/7 weeks by LMP
consistent with ultrasound of the day of admission , as a transfer
from the High-Risk Obstetric Clinic , admitted to the Fuller
Antepartum Service for diabetic control. The patient had
presented to the Special OB Clinic as a new patient for prenatal
care. Review of her medical problems revealed that the recent
glucose control had been suboptimal. In view of this and in view
of the fact that the patient had multiple other issues , the
patient was admitted for diabetic control , adjustment of her
insulin regimen and evaluation regarding the other medical
problems.
History of present pregnancy: the patient had a last
menstrual period in the second week of October . Ultrasound on the
day of admission , 9/5/07 , revealed a 6.6-week intrauterine
pregnancy with a fetal heart rate of 110. The estimated date of
confinement is 4/19/07. Prenatal screening labs were pending at
the time of admission. The patient has blood group O +ve.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of ST elevation
myocardial infarction in 2000. The infarct was a presumed
embolism to the left anterior descending and the left circumflex coronary
artery. The complete occlusion of the mid-to-distal left
anterior descending artery , which was thought to be due to
thrombosis , was treated with TPA and angioplasty. The patient had
a normal catheterization in October 2000. The last echocardiogram
revealed an ejection fraction of 45% in 2002; however , the
patient never had a repeat echo since that time. On the day of
admission , the patient reported that she was able to climb four
flights of stairs to her apartment , haveing to pause after two flights of
stairs to catch her breath.
In addition , the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus , diagnosed in 2000.
The patient had a medical admission in 2006 for hypoglycemia when she
incidentally injected Humalog instead of Lantus. On the day of admission , the
patient was on a Humalog 7 units b.i.d. and Lantus 12 units in
the evening. Her fasting sugars were in the 150s before admission and her
blood sugar measurements were over 200 in the evening. On the day of
admission , the fasting sugar was 123.
In addition , the patient has a history of hepatitis B ,
diagnosed in 2005. The patient had a positive E antigen in 2005.
She had previously been on Epivir 150 mg p.o. daily , but this
was stopped prior to the current pregnancy.
PAST OB/GYN HISTORY: The patient has a history of a fibroid
uterus , and a history of recurrent miscarriages. In terms of the
fibroid uterus , the patient did report pelvic pain in the
outpatient setting. Ultrasound had shown an 8-10 cm
dominant posterior fibroid. The patient occasionally takes
oxycodone for fibroid pain.
In terms of the patient's recurrent miscarriages , the patient had fifteen SABs
in the past with over 10 dilatation and evacuations , including one molar
pregnancy with subsequent choriocarcinoma. All losses were in the first
trimester , less than 12 weeks' gestation. The patient had been
evaluated previously for a thrombophilia workup , but this had
been negative multiple times aside from a MTHFR gene mutation ,
which was noted on this admission , and it is unclear whether this
has been addressed previously. The patient had previously been
told by a reproductive endocrinologist , that she should consider
adoption or a gestational carrier. Chromosomes on several
pathology specimens from the previous abortions showed
aneuploidy.
The patient currently denies a history of sexually
transmitted infections. She has a history of cervical dysplasia ,
with a history of CIN I and CIN II in 1990 and 1992. She
underwent a LEEP in 1992 , which was consistent with HSIL. All
subsequent Pap smears were either within normal limits. Last Pap
smear done in February 2006 at Rexmo Sha Hospital Of was insufficient for
analysis. In terms of the patient's history of choriocarcinoma , the patient
had a molar pregnancy , which then developed into a subsequent choriocarcinoma.
For this , the patient was treated with methotrexate , actinomycin D and Cytoxan ,
then VP-16 , cisplatin and bleomycin with presumed cure.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Dilatation and evacuation x10 ,
hysteroscopy for infertility workup , and LEEP.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Humalog Insulin 7 units twice a day ,
Lantus 12 units in the evening , aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily stopped
prior to pregnancy , history of lamivudine/Epivir use , 150 daily
stopped prior to current pregnancy.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Former smoker , given up smoking in 2000 after a
myocardial infarct. No history of alcohol abuse or IV drug use.
The patient lives in Doreska Dr , Nah Min Knox with her boyfriend , unemployed.
FAMILY HISTORY: No history of GYN malignancies , history of
maternal diabetes , longstanding. Father with coronary artery
disease in his 50s.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for the primary
purpose of diabetic control.
1. Diabetes mellitus. The patient had reported poor diabetic
control as an outpatient. Therefore , her regimen was continued ,
with the addition of a sliding scale , in order to determine the
additional insulin needs as an outpatient. Over the course of
the admission , the patient's Lantus was increased to 20 units at
nighttime , and she was using 8 units three times a day of insulin
lispro , in addition to a lispro sliding scale. With this
regimen , the fingerstick glucose control improved , and the
fasting blood sugar on the day of discharge was 90. On the day
prior to discharge , the patient had blood sugars in the range
from 93 to 139. An HbA1c was sent , which was 6.7 , during this
admission , the patient also had a Nutrition consult. She will be
followed in the High-Risk Obstetric and Diabetic Clinic by Dr.
Borguez
2. Cardiology. The patient was restarted on her aspirin , given
her history of myocardial infarct at a very early age. In
addition , an echocardiogram was obtained on the day after
admission. This revealed an ejection fraction of 50% as well as
a large left ventricular thrombosis , which was presumed to be a
longstanding. Cardiology was consulted and the impression was
that the thrombosis was likely a combination of her left
ventricular hypokinesia related to the previous infarct , as well
as her hypercoagulable state. Therefore , their recommendation
was to start the patient on Lovenox for the duration of this
pregnancy , which adjusted for her weight was a dose of 90 mg
daily , followed by a transition to Coumadin postpartum , to be
continued for likely long-term , possibly lifelong duration. The
Cardiology Consult Team noted that the MTHFR mutation had not
resulted in elevated homocysteine levels in the past. However ,
they did agree that folate supplementation at high doses was
indicated. The patient will be continued on Lovenox 90 mg daily
subcutaneously , and aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily as an outpatient.
She will have Cardiology followup with Dr. Jasper Erps on
3/6/07. During the entire admission , she was hemodynamically
stable , in sinus rhythm , with no complaints of chest pain ,
shortness of breath or palpitations.
3. Hepatitis B. The patient had liver function tests and a
hepatitis panel on this admission , given her history of active
disease diagnosed in 2005 , with a positive hepatitis E antigen.
On admission , the patient had not been on Epivir , which had been
stopped prior to this current pregnancy. Liver function tests
were checked on this admission and were within normal limits. In
addition , serologies were checked and the hepatitis E antigen and
the E antibody was negative. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B
core antigen were reactive. At the time of this dictation , a
hepatitis B viral load was pending. Given the patient's history
of hepatitis B , an outpatient appointment was being arranged at
the time of discharge , with Dr. Lavy , from the Division of
Gastroenterology at the Sasspan Hospital . It was
decided that the patient should not take any lamivudine until
Gastroenterology followup. During the entire hospital stay , the
patient did not have any GI complaints , was tolerating a regular
diet , and having normal regular bowel movements.
4. history of fibroids , the patient was noted again to have an 8-cm fibroid
on her ultrasound scan. She required rare intermittent doses of
oxycodone as required for pain , which was presumed to be related
to her fibroid uterus.
5. Prenatal care. The patient had her first trimester labs sent
on this admission. GC and chlamydia testing were negative.
Urine culture was negative. The patient was O +ve. Given the
patient's history of MTHFR mutation and the recurrent SABs , the
patient was started on prenatal vitamins , as well as high-dose
folic acid , B12 and B6. In view of the patient's diabetic
history , and a transiently elevated creatinine to 1.2 on hospital
day 2 , which went back to 0.7 on the day of discharge , the
patient had a 24-hour urine collection sent , this returned
negative at 92 mg per 24 hours. It was noted that the patient
had an Ophthalmology retinal exam at an outside hospital health
center this year. For the remainder of this pregnancy , it was
noted that the patient will require ultrasounds at 11 and 17
weeks , as well as a fetal echo , and the recommended testing for
pre-gestational diabetics for the remainder of the pregnancy.
The patient was discharged in a stable condition , with followup
appointments arranged for the various specialties.

PROBLEMS: 1. SYNCOPE.
2. ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION.
3. ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
5. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old white male with
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy who was
admitted with syncope. He is status post myocardial infarction in
1979 and 1985 as well as a coronary artery bypass graft in 1987
with a LIMA to LAD , SVG to RCA , SVG to OMB. Over the past ten
years he has complained of increasing CHF symptoms including
dyspnea on exertion , fatigue , chest tightness and has had multiple
admits for exacerbations , the most recent from November to
March , 2001 for progressive fatigue. At that time a right
heart catheterization revealed high filling pressures and he was
treated with aggressive diuresis. Angiography revealed occluded
SVGs and a patent LIMA. Dobutamine radionuclide study revealed
inferior and inferolateral infarct. There was no evidence of
revascularization. Evaluation for heart transplant found cirrhosis
by liver spleen scan which ruled out the possibility of transplant.
He reported light-headedness and dizziness and was seen by the
Electrophysiology Service who performed an EP study which was
negative for provokable VT and since he is not a transplant
candidate it was felt that empiric ICD placement would not be in
his best interest. His light-headedness and presyncope worsened.
His captopril dose was reduced from 37.5 mg to 25 mg t.i.d. with
marked improvement in his energy and less dizziness. Over the past
weeks his dizziness and light-headedness recurred and worsened with
episodes of presyncope and frank syncope. On the day of admission
he was scheduled for a clinic appointment. On arrival he felt
dizzy and ""crumpled"" with loss of consciousness and therefore was
admitted for further evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection
fraction of 15% to 20% in February of 2001 ,
status post anterior MI in 1980 and 1986 , three vessel CABG in 1987
with LIMA to LAD , SVG to OM and SVG to PDA , type 2 diabetes
mellitus , insulin dependent , hypothyroidism , nephrolithiasis ,
gallstones , cardiac cirrhosis which is mild and was diagnosed in
February 2001 by abdominal ultrasound and liver scan , IBS , psoriasis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH
insulin 65 units subcu b.i.d. , Xanax p.r.n. , torsemide 120 mg p.o.
q.a.m. , torsemide 80 mg p.o. q.p.m. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Synthroid 250 mcg p.o. q.d. , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Lying blood pressure
94/58 , heart rate 70 , oxygen
saturation 97% on room air. Sitting blood pressure 78/54. Patient
could not stand secondary to light-headedness to complete
orthostatic vital signs. Afebrile. General: Appearing
comfortable in a supine position. No acute distress.
Cardiovascular: Regular. Normal S1 , S2. No S3. JVP
approximately 5 cm. A II/VI holosystolic murmur at apex. Lungs:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft , non-tender ,
nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: No edema.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 128 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 91 ,
bicarbonate 22 , BUN 64 , creatinine 2.6 ,
glucose 348. White blood cell count 17.9 , hematocrit 37.6 ,
platelets 286.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: None.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 62-year-old white male with history of
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary
artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy and probably cardiac
cirrhosis who presents with presyncope and syncope. The arrhythmia
was considered possible and there has been none documented and he
was not inducible two years prior to admission. Given his
orthostatic vital signs it was felt that his volume status and
medications were responsible for his symptoms. In addition his
elevated BUN and creatinine were consistent with volume depletion.
He improved off diuretics , nitrates and ACE inhibitor as well as
liberalization of his diet regarding salt and fluid intake. There
were no arrhythmias noted on his telemetry monitor. An endocrine
consult was called to evaluate for possible contribution of
autonomic insufficiency secondary to his diabetes mellitus. They
recommended decreasing his Synthroid dose due to a suppressed TSH
as well as more aggressive blood sugar control , however , they were
unable to document orthostatic hypotension and felt that his
episodes of presyncope and syncope were related to his volume
status and medications rather than autonomic insufficiency.

ATTENDING: SWEED , ZANE MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MRSA-infected abdominal mesh.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 90+-year-old male with a
complex past medical history including CAD status post stent x2 ,
hypertension , CHF with an EF of 10-20% , AF , on chronic
anticoagulation , status post pacer placement , and diabetes
mellitus who presented to the SICU status post exploratory
laparotomy for removal of chronically MRSA-infected mesh from
prior abdominal surgery. He was admitted to the ICU for
careful monitoring and fluid volume management
postoperatively. He has had multiple abdominal surgeries. The
mesh was originally placed for ventral hernia repair in 2005. He
had since developed draining sinus tracts for which cultures have
grown out MRSA. He was admitted preoperatively for reversal of
anticoagulation and semi-urgent removal of the mesh. In the
operating room , he underwent an exploratory laparotomy , lysis of
adhesions and removal of the abdominal mesh. He was closed and
one Jackson-Pratt drain was left in place. During the procedure ,
he was intubated with etomidate , succinylcholine and kept sedated
with Versed and fentanyl. He received intraoperative vancomycin
and levofloxacin as well as 2200 mL of lactated Ringer's. In an
attempt to reverse anticoagulation , one unit of FFP was begun but
then aborted due to hypotension , which resolved with epinephrine
injection , likely due to transfusion reaction. Another unit of
FFP was hung and tolerated well. EBL was 300 mL. Urine output
was 410 mL for the four-hour case. He was extubated uneventfully
and transferred to the ICU in stable condition.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Colon cancer , status post colonoscopy in 2005 that was
negative.
2. Prostate cancer.
3. History of CVA with a left occipital infarct thought to be

remarkable for bleeding with sanguinous output from the JP drain ,
a question of an abdominal hematoma and a progressive drop in his
hematocrit. The heparin drip , which was initiated given the
patient's chronic AF , was discontinued and FFP administered.
Platelets were also given at the request of the Plastic Surgery
Team in light of aspirin and Plavix , which were continued due to
the patient's cardiac stents. Despite bolus Lasix , the patient
did develop CHF with symptomatic pulmonary edema and increased
oxygen requirement. Concomitantly , the patient also became
delirious , as is his historical pattern with significant agitation.
He developed hypertension refractory to beta-blockade , calcium
channel blockers and IV ACE inhibitors in this setting. The
patient was thus placed on a nitroglycerin drip , a furosemide
drip with ginger blood product resuscitation to address bleeding
and an elevated INR. He responded well to this regimen and
aggressive pulmonary toilet. Both the patient's PCP , Dr.
Gillice , and his cardiologist , Dr. Keks , did follow the
patient. His oxygenation never suffered during this time and he
did not have significant hypercarbia. He was eventually weaned
back to nasal cannula. He did have a mild transient elevation in
creatinine while on the Lasix drip but has since recovered back
to baseline off of the Lasix drip. His nasogastric tube was
removed on 5/18/06 and he tolerated ice chips without
difficulty. His home cardiac medications were restarted on
6/10/06. The patient was out of bed and ambulating without
difficulty. At the time of dictation , his nitroglycerin drip was
being weaned with the assistance of nitro paste. He is
anticipated to be transferred to the floor once he receives a red
blood cell transfusion and once the nitroglycerin drip is off.
PLAN:
Neuro:
1. The patient does sundown at home and has done so while in
the ICU. He has been much more calm and appropriate over the
past 24 to 36 hours.
2. He does experience more significant delirium with morphine
and less so with sparing Dilaudid p.r.n.
3. We will continue with sparing Dilaudid p.r.n. , and Zyprexa
2.5 at bedtime p.r.n. per home regimen. Haldol is written p.r.n.
as needed.
Cardiovascular:
1. CAD status post stent x2 , AF on chronic anticoagulation , CHF ,
status post pacer for sick sinus syndrome , currently V paced.
2. Outpatient systolic blood pressure 150 to 180 , current goal

Discharge Date: 2/1/2001
CHIEF COMPLAINT: LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY NUMBNESS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Milo Barta is a 78-year-old
African American female with a
significant cardiac history , including hypertension , congestive
heart failure , history of afib -- patient is on Coumadin , CAD ,
status post MI , mitral valve replacement in 1995 or so , who was in
her usual state of health until the morning of admission , when she
says she awoke in a sweat , had a headache , and noticed she could
not stand. She felt that her left lower extremity was ""asleep"" and
weak. She called 911 , came to PCH . The patient also noted that
her speech seemed slurred at the time that she was unable to get
up. She denied any weakness or numbness in her other extremities
or face. She denied any chest pain , shortness of breath , or visual
changes. She says she did note transient heart palpitations. She
denied fever , chills , nausea , and vomiting. In the ER the patient
was noted to have 2/5 left lower extremity power. She had no
apparent sensory deficits at that time.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above , and including noninsulin dependent
diabetes mellitus , a status post left hip
replacement , history of DVT , status post mitral valve replacement
for mitral stenosis approximately eight years ago ( patient says she
has a history of rheumatic fever ) , and bilateral cataracts.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Norvasc 10 mg q. day , amiodarone 200 mg
q. day , Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 40
mg q. day , Coumadin 5 mg Monday , Wednesday , and Friday and 2.5 mg
Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday , and Sunday , Lomotil 1-2 mg q.i.d.
p.r.n. , glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. , and Prinivil 20 mg q. day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient denied any history of tobacco , ethanol , or
illicit drug use. She lives alone and says she is
a very private person. She does all of her own activities of daily
living and walks with a cane.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's mother died of an MI and her father
apparently died of a PE. She has a son that died
of an MI as well.
ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to penicillin , sulfa drugs ,
and aspirin.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On being admitted to the hospital , the
patient was afebrile at 97.4 degrees
Fahrenheit , with a pulse of 68 , blood pressure of 190/90 , and
satting 98% on room air. Patient's exam showed that she had no
carotid bruits or JVD. Her heart exam was notable for a regular
rate and rhythm , as well as prosthetic S1. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally and abdominal exam was benign.
Extremities showed cool fingers on the right , with a 1+ pulse , and
warm well perfused fingers on the left , with a 2+ radial pulse.
Apparently , these extremity changes are long-standing and not new.
She had 2+ pulses in her posterior tibial pulses and trace pulses
in her dorsalis pedes pulses bilaterally. On neuro exam the
patient was alert and oriented x three. She exhibited good naming ,
comprehension , reading , and fluency. Cranial nerves II-XII were
intact bilaterally. On motor exam the patient had 5/5 power
everywhere except for the left lower extremity , with knee flexors ,
knee extensors , ankle flexors , and ankle extensors being 3+/5 and
hip flexors and hip extensors being 4-/5. Her tone was slightly
increased in her left lower extremity. On sensory exam she had
slightly reduced sensation to pinprick , light touch , and
temperature in both extremities to the hip. Deep tendon reflexes
were symmetric and 2+ throughout , with downgoing toes bilaterally.
Pertinent labs on admission showed a slightly increased creatinine
at 1.7 and a BUN of 31. The patient had a TSH of 1.09 and a total
cholesterol of 197 , with an LDL of 131. Her sed. rate was 14 and
her hematocrit was 40.2. INR was noted to be 1.7. CKs were flat
and the patient was ruled out for an MI.
IMPRESSION:
1. Neurologic: Given the patient's significant cardiac history
and subtherapeutic INR , it was considered that her left lower
extremity weakness that was transient was likely a transient
ischemic attack. The patient's motor deficits quickly improved
over her hospital stay and she felt she was back to baseline on the
day of discharge. Head CT and head MRI and MRA were negative for
any acute changes , including hemorrhage and infarction. On MRA the
patient was noted to have some proximal stenosis of her right
intracranial carotid and had also some atherosclerotic changes of
her PCAs bilaterally. The patient also had ATTE with a bubble
study that was negative for PFO. The patient was continued on her
Coumadin at 5 mg q.h.s. until her INR was therapeutic. During this
interval she was started on heparin and was therapeutic on that.
The patient is to follow up in the Coumadin clinic as well as
neurology clinic in one month. She is to have her Coumadin drawn
at three days after discharge to ensure that her INR is above 2.
Her Coumadin dosing regimen was slightly changed , with her taking
four doses of 5 mg a week and three doses of 2.5 mg a week. The
patient was seen by physical therapy , who cleared her to go home
and felt that she was okay to walk stairs with her walker.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient has an extensive cardiac history
as detailed above. Her systolic blood pressure was calculated
between 120 and 160 during the first day of her hospital stay , as
it was unclear whether she had a serious carotid stenosis or not.
Her blood pressure meds were gradually added back. The patient had
several episodes of atypical chest pain , for which she was ruled
out with telemetry and enzymes , which were flat.
3. Endocrine: The patient was placed on a diabetic diet and was
continued on her glyburide. A hemoglobin A1C is pending at the
time of this dictation. She was covered with sliding scale insulin
during her hospital stay.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Amiodarone 200 mg q. day , Norvasc 10 mg
q. day , Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 40
mg q. day , Coumadin 5 mg Monday , Wednesday , Friday , and Sunday , and
2.5 mg Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday , glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. ,
Lasix 40 mg q. day , and Prinivil 20 mg q. day.

SERVICE: Coronary Care Unit.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Kolppa was a 58-year-old
woman with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and ejection
fraction of 15% who was initially admitted to the Faharb Medical Center Of following a cardiac arrest. On arrival in the
emergency department she was found to have recurrent ventricular
tachycardia and was defibrillated. She required an intraaortic
balloon pump to maintain her blood pressure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy. She has a pacemaker/ICD. She has a history of
chronic kidney disease , deep venous thrombosis , history of
cerebrovascular accident , history of hypercholesterolemia ,
history of coronary artery disease , history of diabetes , history
of GI bleed and history of chronic hepatitis C.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: Ms. Rubins had a complicated
course in the hospital and her care was related primarily to
recurrent ventricular tachycardia and prolonged anoxic injury
affecting multiple organ systems. During her hospital course ,
she required pressor medications , an intraaortic balloon pump ,
and ventilator support. Of note , the patient had noted , prior to her
admission , that she would never want to be dependent upon ""machines."" Due to
poor neurological status and poor
prognosis , and in conjunction with the patient's previously expressed wishes ,
medical care was withdrawn on 4/25 after many discussions with family. The
patient's primary care physician , Dr Sangh , was involved with these
discussions. The intraaortic balloon pump was turned off. Pressure medications
were held and the mechanical ventilator was stopped. The patient passed away
on 11/17/07 shortly after removal of mechanical support.

Discharge Date: 9/30/2001
PROCEDURE: Left lower extremity revascularization.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63 year old male with a
history of peripheral vascular disease
status post a left femoral to peroneal bypass graft on 4/19/01 for
left lower extremity rest pain. He presents with eleven days of
left lower extremity swelling. Over the prior eight days the
patient noticed pain and pinkish discoloration of the left foot.
The patient also noticed occasional left foot coldness which was
relieved with dependent positioning.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Peripheral vascular disease. Hypertension.
Diabetes mellitus. Aortic stenosis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left femoral to peroneal bypass in July of
2001. Right femoral to peroneal bypass in
September of 1999. Right fifth toe amputation in September of 1999. Multiple
wrist surgeries , including a failed left wrist fusion.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: He is on outpatient medications of Lopressor 25 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Glipizide 10 mg q.a.m. and 5 mg q.p.m. , Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. qhs ,
Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , and p.r.n. Percocet.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 10/21/01 for presumed
failed left femoral to peroneal bypass graft.
The patient was preopped for revision of his bypass graft and , on
1/26/01 , the patient was taken to the operating room for a femoral
to posterior tibial bypass graft. The patient tolerated the
procedure well but immediately postoperatively the patient was
noted to have non-Dopplerable signals in his left foot. The
patient was brought back to the operating room at which time the
significant sized clot was found in the distal anastomosis of the
graft which was removed. Again , the patient was returned to the
recovery room and , in the ensuing hours , the patient again lost all
Dopplerable signals in his left foot. On postoperative day #1 the
patient returned one more time to the operating room for revision
of his left bypass graft. The patient tolerated the procedure well
and had strong Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior
tibial pulse throughout the remainder of his hospital stay. The
patient was kept on perioperative Ancef antibiotics.
On postoperative day #0 the patient was found to be in respiratory
distress. Chest x-ray revealed flash pulmonary edema. Cardiology
consult was obtained at that time and an echocardiogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 35 percent with moderate aortic stenosis and
regurgitation. The patient ruled in by enzymes for a myocardial
infarction. The patient was kept on beta blocker for goal heart
rate less than 75 and was started on Digoxin. Cardiology also
recommended the addition of an Ace inhibitor for further blood
pressure control. The patient remained stable. He remained in the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit for the first three days
postoperatively at which time the patient was medically stable and
transferred to a surgical floor and monitored bed. Repeat
echocardiogram on postoperative day #4 and #3 was unchanged from
his prior echocardiogram , again , revealing an ejection fraction of
35 percent with global hypokinesis , severe aortic stenosis , and
moderate aortic regurgitation. Cardiology continued to follow the
patient throughout his hospital stay. They recommended the patient
return for cardiac catheterization following a short stay in acute
rehabilitation. Otherwise the patient progressed well. He did
develop a small amount of erythema in his left lower extremity
incision site. He was restarted on antibiotics and the erythema
slowly regressed over the ensuing three days. Otherwise the
patient's incisions to his right arm , left leg , and right leg all
were clean , dry , and intact with staples.
Physical therapy consult was obtained and the patient was able to
ambulate with the assistance of a walker. The patient continued to
progress well. He tolerated a regular diet and ambulated and
voided without difficulty. On postoperative days #9 and #8 , the
patient was accepted to acute rehabilitation at which time he was
transferred. The patient is in stable condition.
DISPOSITION: LEVEL OF ACTIVITY: He should continue working with
physical therapy to increase his mobility. DIET: He
has no restrictons of diet. Please keep his left lower extremity
elevated when he is resting in bed or in chair. Please call
Abed General Hospital if he experiences fevers , chills , or
redness or discharge from the surgical site. FOLLOWUP: The
patient is to follow-up with Dr. Koss in the vascular clinic.
Please call Cing Medical Center vascular clinic to arrange
for an appointment. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: He is discharged on
enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Captopril 25 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. , Glipizide 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. and

Discharge Date: 9/1/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57-year-old status
post a massive gastrointestinal bleed
in April of 2001 who was transferred to the Gosroa Health Services
Hospital for a TIPS procedure which failed. She proceeded to go to
surgery at that time for a splenorenal shunt. She was recently
discharged from the Tonla Liha Measemillr Hospital And Clinic on August ,
2002. During the hospitalization , she had a complicating course
with encephalopathy , but she was able to be controlled with
lactulose and discharged to rehabilitation. She at that time also
had complications with infections for which she completed a course
of antibiotics. At rehabilitation , she was doing fairly well , but
her ammonia had been high. The highest was 196 on March ,
2002. The patient has also had increased confusion , increased
abdominal girth. When the daughters went in to visit her today ,
she was completely disoriented , complaining of abdominal pain. The
daughters also report subjective fevers and chills. At the
rehabilitation , her vital signs were notable for a blood pressure
of 94/60 , temperature 99.2. Per the daughters , the diet had not
been followed at rehabilitation and she was eating hot dogs. She
was also given benzodiazepines for sleep , up to 60-75 mg q. day of
Oxazepam. Per report , she had increased confusion and more acutely
in the last two days. In the emergency room on arrival , her blood
pressure was in the 120s , 98% on room air , she was febrile. She
was given levofloxacin , Flagyl and ampicillin. A Gastrointestinal
consult was called.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C , grade 4
esophageal varices , encephalopathy , status
post a frontal craniotomy , status post a motor vehicle accident
with a subdural hematoma , peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Spironolactone 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
olanzapine unknown dose , Flagyl which she
had completed her course for Clostridium difficile , albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers , lactulose 120 mg q.6h. , Lopressor 50 mg
t.i.d. , Serax 30 mg , Duragesic patch , Neomycin 2 grams q.i.d. ,
Oxazepam 30 mg q.h.s. and 15 mg q.8h. p.r.n.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with one of her daughters. She
has a remarkable history of tobacco for 30 years ,
one pack per day , recently quit.
FAMILY HISTORY: Non-contributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 101.1 , heart rate
99-120 , blood pressure 94-149/55-71 , oxygen
saturation 99% on room air. GENERAL: She was a well-nourished ,
well-developed lady who was confused and agitated. HEENT:
Remarkable for icteric sclera. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIOVASCULAR:
She had a regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 normal. Jugular
venous pressure was flat. ABDOMEN: Positive for bowel sounds ,
soft , but distended. She reports tenderness on palpation. RECTAL:
Guaiac-positive per emergency department. EXTREMITIES: Her right
lower extremity had erythema , painful to the touch , no warmth and
no cords. NEUROLOGICAL: Positive for asterixis. She was alert
and oriented to person , but not to time and confused about the
place. She was unable to carry on a conversation and unable to
keep attentive. Her strength was 5/5 and her sensation was intact.
LABORATORY: Laboratory data was remarkable for a sodium of 130 ,
potassium 4.9 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 17 , BUN 9 ,
creatinine 0.8 and glucose 100. Her ALT was 16 , AST 72 , alkaline
phosphatase 118 , amylase 15 and lipase 33. Her ammonia level was
45 , albumin 3.2 , total bilirubin 2.4. Her hematocrit was 29.1.
Her INR was 1.4. EKG was normal sinus rhythm. Abdominal CT scan
showed that she had no abscess , no obstruction , no acute abdominal
process.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Gastrointestinal: At the time of admission ,
it was a confusing picture for increased
abdominal girth , however the CT scan showed that she had very
little ascites and on examination , little tenderness. Therefore ,
she got a paracentesis which was negative for spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis. The patient was treated with cefotaxime and Flagyl
for possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis , continued on the
lactulose and her diuretics. However , the patient much improved
from the gastrointestinal standpoint and after resolution of her
infectious picture ( see below ) , the patient was doing incredibly
well with spironolactone and Lasix. She has not been able to
tolerate her beta blocker secondary to hypotension. During her
hospitalization , her hematocrit has been stable. A
gastrointestinal consult was obtained. I appreciate their input.
They recommend to follow up with the Transplant Team. She has an
appointment to see the Transplant Team on July , 2002. At this
time , it is recommended that she begin to get work-up for a liver
transplant. However , her hematocrit and her INR remained stable
throughout the hospitalization.
2 ) Infectious disease: The patient was negative for spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis , however on the second day of
hospitalization , she grew out 4/4 bottles with gram positive cocci
in pairs which speciated to be Streptococcus Group B. Therefore ,
the antibiotics were tailored and she was started on nafcillin
intravenously. The patient then had a PICC line placed and she
will continue treatment of two weeks with intravenous penicillin.
The patient has been doing very well with resolution of her
erythema. Infectious Disease Service consult was obtained. I
appreciate their input. They suggested two weeks of intravenous
penicillin.
3 ) Cardiovascular/hematology: Given the swelling of the leg , the
patient had lower extremity ultrasounds which were negative for
clot. Otherwise , she remained in normal sinus rhythm and no
symptoms of congestive heart failure.
4 ) Psychiatry: The patient was very confused , most likely
delirium. Psychiatry input was greatly appreciated. Another
reason for her confusion was the fact that she was getting much
benzodiazepines at her rehabilitation before. She was weaned off
her benzodiazepines and started on olanzapine and titrated up as
tolerated. Therefore , we highly recommend avoiding benzodiazepines
in this patient and continue with olanzapine which can take p.r.n.
as well as needed.
5 ) Vascular: Vascular Surgery followed this patient during her
hospitalization and deemed that her splenorenal shunt was working
well with no evidence of leak.
DISPOSITION: The patient is sent to rehabilitation for further
treatment and finishing of her antibiotic course. At
this point , she has requested a new primary care physician and this
will be myself. I will follow her with an appointment in July ,
which I have scheduled for her.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Nexium 20 mg p.o. q. day , olanzapine 5
mg p.o. q. PM and olanzapine 2.5 mg p.o.
q.8h. p.r.n. , Atrovent inhalers , Azmacort , spironolactone 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , penicillin 3 million units intravenously q.4h. for a
complete course of two weeks , Nico-Derm 14 mg a day topical ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. which is to be held if her systolic
blood pressure is less than 100 , lactulose 30 ml p.o. t.i.d. ,
Motrin p.r.n. for pain and Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day.

cath '91 , h/o CHF , now presenting with 2 episodes
of ?syncope. First episode while sitting ,
?LOC , second episode while leaning over , likely no
LOC , both episodes without pre- or
post-syncopal SOB/palpitations/lightheadedness/confusion
or other sx. In ED had Lleg/armpain and HA.
Had negative Head CT , neg Lextremity films.
Meds noteable for extensive cardiac regimen
including lopressor , coumadin ,
amio , norvasc , lisinopril , lasix , isordil. CXR showed mild CHF
?Lbase effusion. ECHO 18 of January EF65% , EKG old inferior
MI changes/primary AVblock. Noted bradycardia to
30s while asleep on night of
admission CV: unclear etiology of syncopal episodes but
CV likely given her history. Will call Cards
consult in a.m. Important to assess specific
etiology given need for coumadin for MVR versus fall
risk with the syncopal episodes.Orthostatics
negative. Cardiology consulted , and recommended an event monitor to
assess for specific rhythms while she is symptomatic. Over her hospital
course , she had one episode of near-syncope similar to her weekend
symptoms. There was no typical rhythm noted on telemetry at that time.
Cardiology recommended monitoring HR and BP and consider d/c'ing
Lopressor if it is excessively low and correlating with symptoms.
Would follow up on event monitor to determine need for further
intervention.
Neuro: Head MR negative; ruled out intracranial
ischemia/bleed. Heme: INR 4.3 on admission and restarted after holding
for one day. Restarted coumadin at usual home dosing. On 7/10 INR was
2.1 so arranged for 4days of Lovenox to be given if INR is not
therapeutic.
Follow up plan: Event monitor to be ordered. Patient to follow up with
Dr. Bergerson and Dr. Gamma in 1-2 weeks. Visiting nurse to do home safety
eval , and monitor INR/administer Lovenox if needed , and check
BP/HR/symptoms.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: For visiting nurse: Please draw blood qd for 5 days to check INR. If it
is less than 2 please give the Lovenox injections for the day. If it
remains in 2-3 range , just continue the regular Coumadin dosing. Please
check BP and heart rate and call primary doctor Dr. Mickles if it is
excessively low or high and patient is complaining of symptoms. Please
ensure she is wearing her event monitor.

TEAM: S Terchu Fay
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: The condition responsible for causing this
admission is pneumonia.
LIST OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES: COPD , CAD , diabetes type
2 , hypertension , TIA , TVD , psoriasis.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 70-year-old female
with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , COPD , diabetes type
2 who was admitted with dyspnea and tachycardia on the 10/28/06.
The patient reported a history of cough with productive sputum x3
days and chest pain pleuritic in nature. She denied any nausea ,
vomiting , any bowel or bladder symptoms. She denied headache ,
fatigue , anorexia. Per her family , the patient had a fever to
103 and some confusion while reportedly at home. In the
Emergency Department at Re Memorial Hospital , she was tachypneic to the 40s
sating upper 80s on room air and had a fingerstick glucose of 30.
An ABG was consistent with a respiratory acidosis , pH of 7.3 ,
pCO2 of 55 , pO2 of 63 , sating 89% on 2 L. An admission chest
x-ray demonstrated an opacity at the left base. An EKG showed
some left-sided strain unchanged from prior. She received
azithromycin and ceftriaxone in the Emergency Department as well
as vancomycin and was started on BiPAP and transferred to the
MICU. In the MICU , she was treated as a COPD flare with
steroids , antibiotics , and nebulizers , however , the patient began
to tire and developed worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure
so was intubated on the night of the admission and extubated five
days later. Over the course of her MICU admission , she developed
AFib and had a troponin leak. Otherwise , the stay was
unremarkable and she extubated without complication and
transferred to the GMS Services on 4/8/06.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis
Monday , Wednesday and Friday. The renal failure is secondary to
renal artery stenosis. Hemodialysis began in April 2005.
Diabetes type 2 with hemoglobin A1c of 5.8. COPD , no PFTs are
available. Hypertension. Coronary artery disease with history
of remote MI , diastolic dysfunction/CHF. TIA for which she
receives Coumadin. Bilateral fem-pop bypasses , psoriasis and a
perforated appendix.

81 , iron t.i.d. , Paxil 10 , Nephrocaps daily , Flovent and
Combivent doses unknown.
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS TO THE GMS SERVICE: Diltiazem 90 p.o.
q.i.d. , Lopressor 37.5 q.i.d. , aspirin , albuterol , PhosLo ,
Colace , Pepcid , insulin NPH 15 units b.i.d. , Nicotine patch ,
nystatin , prednisone taper , betamethasone , captopril 50 t.i.d. ,
Coumadin 2 , simvastatin 20 , an Aspart sliding scale and p.r.n.
lactulose , Zyprexa and Ativan.
ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is an active smoker , smokes about a pack and
a half a day for the past 55 years. Lives with her daughter , has
9 children.
PHYSICAL EXAM UPON TRANSFER TO THE GMS SERVICE: Weight 92.9 ,
temperature is 96.2 , heart rate 118 AFib , BP 107/57 , sating 95%
on 2 L. In general , she appeared younger than stated age. She
had a psoriatic rash on her right thigh. Neuro exam , she was
hard of hearing , otherwise her cranial nerves were intact and she
was alert and oriented x3. Head and neck exam notable for JVP of
5 cm of water. Mucous membranes were moist. Her oropharynx was
clear. Her extraocular motions were full. Her cardiac exam , she
had a regular rhythm without appreciable murmurs , rubs or
gallops , no heaves. Lungs , she had expiratory wheezing without
rhonchi or crackles. Abdomen , although distended but soft , no
laparotomy scar , normoactive bowel sounds without guarding. She
had a Port-A-Cath in her right chest that appeared clean , dry and
intact. Extremities , she had TEDs and SCDs , bilateral pedal
edema , they were warm.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. From a Pulmonary Standpoint: Pneumonia/COPD flare. The patient was
admitted with pneumonia and COPD flare for which she needed to be intubated and
had a short MICU stay. She did well on antibiotics and was
changed from ceftriaxone , azithromycin , and vancomycin to
levofloxacin which she completed a ten-day course. She also
started on steroid taper and will leave with 20 mg of prednisone
for two more days and then 10 mg of prednisone for three days.
Upon transfer to the floor , she was restarted on Combivent and
Flovent and received p.r.n. albuterol nebulizers and albuterol
inhaler on a q.4 basis. Smoking cessation was emphasized with
the patient. Ace consult was called and the nicotine patch was
continued. She was given a flu vaccine while in the hospital.
The blood cultures and sputum cultures were unrevealing and her
O2 saturation was titrated to greater than 93%.
2. From an endocrine perspective she had a history of diabetes
type 2. She was fleetingly placed on Portland protocol while in
MICU and then transferred to NPH 15 b.i.d. insulin and NovoLog
sliding scale. She should continue her aspirin and ACE inhibitor
as an outpatient and later her hemoglobin A1c was consistent with
very well controlled diabetic.
3. From a cardiovascular standpoint:
A. Ischemia. Her troponin peaked to 0.38 on 11/22/06 while in
the MICU. It was not associated with any dynamic EKG changes ,
however , her EKG does show some evidence of strain versus
infralateral ischemia with T-waves inversions in the inferior and
lateral leads. Her troponin trended down over the course of the
admission and on last check were less than 0.2. There was a
question of whether this leak was due to volume overload versus
infection. Her aspirin , statin , beta-blocker , and ACE were
continued. Her fasting lipid profile was remarkable only for
hypertriglyceridemia and HDL of 38. She is scheduled for a
outpatient nuclear medicine stress test on 8/13/06 at 09:00 a.m.
B. Rate. She was noted to be in AFib on the MICU and rate was
controlled with diltiazem and Lopressor titrated to heart rate of
80 , she was monitored on tele over the course of admission. She
was already in Coumadin for TIAs , however , the new INR goal for
her is between 2 and 3 and Coumadin levels should be checked at
the time of dialysis.
C. Pump. Her EF was 55% on echo that was done while in the
MICU. There is some evidence of aortic sclerosis , otherwise ,
there is no hypokinesis or wall motion abnormalities noted.
4. From a hematologic standpoint , she was started on epopoietin
for anemia of chronic disease. Her baseline hematocrit of 35
dropped to 26 while in the MICU and she received a unit of blood
for that. Following that transfusion , her hematocrit was stable
in the lower to mid 30s. She was also restarted on iron , which
she takes as an outpatient. Her stool is guaiac negative over
the course of the admission.
5. From a GI perspective , the patient had a mild transaminitis
noted while in the MICU thought likely secondary to hepatic
congestion. Viral serologies were drawn including hep B and C ,
which were negative. Her transaminitis resolved on its own.
6. From a dermatologic perspective , the patient has a history of
psoriasis. She was continued on topical steroids with good
effect.
7. From an infectious disease standpoint , this patient has
evidence of pneumonia by clinical exam and chest x-ray on
admisison , which appeared to be resolved. She completed a
ten-day course of levofloxacin. In addition , multiple cultures
were taken while in the MICU including that from the A line which
grew out coag-negative staph thought likely to be a contaminate.
8. Neuro exam , she was alert and oriented and intact upon
transfer to the medical service. For history of TIAs her
Coumadin was continued.
9. FEN. The patient was started on a renal diabetic low-fat
diet and was fluid restricted to 2 L a day.
10. Renal. The patient is on dialysis Monday , Wednesday , and
Friday for end-stage renal disease secondary to RAS. She is
followed by renal and had a renal attending during the course of
this hospitalization. She was started on Neutra-Phos ,
Nephrocaps , and her PhosLo was continued. Her calcium and
phosphorus were monitored q.a.m. and her IPTH was checked and was
415.
11. Prophylaxis. Heparin was continued subcu until her INR was
therapeutic. She still is on VRE precautions for a positive
rectal swab.
She was a full code.
Discharge medications will be included as an addendum.

Discharge Date: 2/15/1993
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Mcguirl is a 44 year old man with a
history of hypertension and a family
history of coronary artery disease who presents with new onset of
chest pain. He has been previously treated at the PH for
hypertension. He has no cardiac history , no prior history of chest
pain. He ran out of his blood pressure medicines approximately one
week prior to presentation. He was feeling well until the day of
admission while at work when he noted onset of substernal chest
pain while seated. He was diaphoretic , nauseated , but had no
vomiting. He also had some shortness of breath but no
palpitations. He went to SH with the same pain and an
electrocardiogram showed LVH with strain. He was given oxygen and
sublingual Nitroglycerin without relief. He was sent to the
Rahoag Hospital emergency room. There , he was treated
with Magnesium Sulfate , IV Lopressor , IV Nitroglycerin , and
sublingual Nifedipine. His blood pressure at WMC had been 210/150.
His pain then resolved with a total of approximately five hours.
He was entirely pain-free since his treatment in the emergency
room. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for only hypertension. He
was on three medications which he is unsure of , including
Captopril. He apparently had good blood pressure control with his
blood pressure medication. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Captopril of unknown dose; Hydrochloro-
thiazide 15 mg po q day; Diltiazem of unknown dose. FAMILY
HISTORY: Significant for his father who died of myocardial
infarction at age 50. SOCIAL HISTORY: He works as a plumber at
Hunt Ca He does not drink and does not smoke.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is a middle-aged , black man , in no
apparent distress. His blood pressure was
140/100 , pulse 76 , afebrile. Head and neck exam showed PERRL ,
oropharynx was benign. Neck was supple and no adenopathy. Lungs
were clear to auscultation. His cardiovascular exam revealed a
regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , an S4 gallop. No
murmurs or rubs , no jugular venous distention , and his carotids
were 2+ bilaterally. Abdomen; good bowel sounds , no hepato-
splenomegaly , no masses. Extremities; no clubbing , cyanosis , or
edema. Neurologic exam was non-focal.
LABORATORY EVALUATION: potassium 4.9 , BUN 11 , creatinine 1.1 ,
glucose 134 , hematocrit 44.6 , white count of
11 , and platelets of 223. CK was 215. PT was 12.1 , PTT 30.1. His
electrocardiogram showed him to be in normal sinus rhythm at 83
beats per minute , normal intervals , axis was -29. He did have LVH
with strain. His chest x-ray showed no pulmonary vascular
redistribution , no effusions or infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the coronary care unit
and ruled in for a myocardial infarction. His
peak CK was 453 with MB fraction of 16.5. He was in the coronary
care unit for one day , after which he was transferred to the floor.
He had no arrhythmias or complications of his myocardial
infarction. Echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderate
concentric LVH with moderate chamber enlargement , posterolateral
hypokinesis , and ejection fraction of 45% , and moderate mitral
regurgitation with thickened mitral valve leaflets. His
hypertension was initially controlled with Lopressor 150 mg three
times a day. He was then changed to Atenolol and Captopril. With
these medications , he had good blood pressure control. One week
after his myocardial infarction , he underwent an exercise tolerance
test MIBI. He went for 9 minutes on his exercise tolerance test
and stopped due to completion of his protocol. He had no chest
pain or shortness of breath and no ischemic changes on his EKG , and
reached a peak blood pressure of 180/85 and a peak pulse of 94.
His MIBI images showed a fixed defect in the apical anterior
lateral wall , but no reversible changes , consistent with myocardial
infarction but no ischemia. He is discharged to home in stable
condition.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
78 yo man who presents with 2 episodes of SSCP. Recently had MV and TV
repair with SVG to OM1. Reported to have 80% diag , 70% LCX from a cath
in Ohio in 3/1 Also h/o HTN , DM 2 ( diet controlled ) , AF ,
ventricular pacemaker , ischemic CMP , EF 30%. CP occurred while at
rest , no radiation and no associated symptoms. 1st episode was 10/8 ,
resolved spontaneously. Came to ED , EKG was paced , CK flat , TnI
elevated at 0.17 , similar to value on 4/21 when pt came in for a TIA.
Mr. Faiella was sent home with sl nitro. Pain occurred again while
watching TV , resolved with one sl nitro. Was admitted for workup of
possible ischemia. Currently CP free.
1. CV: Ischemia: ruled out for MI , added isordil to regimen , ASA.
Continue carvedilol , captopril. Likely to have CAD , Adenosine MIBI
revealed fixed inf/lat defect , consistent with LCX disease. No
reversible defects. Since chest pain is unlikely to be cardiac in
origin , will stop nitrates. Pt was able to amubulate w/o SOB or CP
CHF: euvolemic. continue lasix , aldactone , digoxin.
2. Endo: DM 2 , diet controlled. HbA1C 5.8%
3. Renal: baseline Cr 2.0
4. Neuro: recent history of TIA , on coumadin , may not want to reverse
anticoagulation for possibility of cath.
5. Heme: coumadin was held for possible cath , but was restarted on day
of discharge.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted to the hospital for chest pain , and we have made sure
that you are not and did not have a heart attack. We also did a
perfusion test to make sure that your heart muscle is receiving
adequate amounts of blood flow. If your chest pain recurrs , gets
worse , or you become short of breath , please call you cardiologist and
return to the emergency department.

OTHER TREATMENTS/PROCEDURES ( NOT IN O.R. )

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
76yoM with CAD s/p CABG 1997 presented with 2-3 weeks of nocturnal
angina with increased nitroglycerin requirement for relief. Given
limitations of imaging modalities due to his severe spinal stenosis ,
MIBI/ETT were not feasible , so the patient presented for elective
catheterization 5/16/06. Upon catherization , two occlusions were noted in
the PLV: a 90% occlusion , as well as a moderate sized plaque.
Revascularization was achieved with the placement of non-drug alluding
stents to these lesions; the original 90% lesion was stented to 0%
occlusion. During the catheterization , Dr. Taran noted a gradient of
40mmHg from the thoracic aorta to the femoral aorta raising the
possibility of this as an etiology for Mr. Mcconnell 's severe lower back pain
and limited ability to ambulate. The catheterization was without
complications. The patient was placed on Plavix x 6 weeks and Aspirin
indefinately following the procedure , and continued on his home regimen
of Captopril , Metoprolol , Isordil , Digoxin , Spironalactone , Insulin ,
Lasix , Zocor and prn Nitroglycerin. Groin sheaths were removed and the
patient was without hematoma or bruit. He had 2 episodes of chest
pressure several hours following the procedure with negative EKG and
stable vitals; the symptoms resolved with oxycodone and did not recur.
On discharge he was ambulating confortably without chest pain or shortness
of breath.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take your Aspirin and Plavix. The Aspirin needs to be taken every
day on a long term basis , and the Plavix must be taken for ATLEAST 6
WEEKS from 10/29
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Please follow up with your Cardiologist , Dr. Golaszewski
Please take your Plavix 75mg for 6 weeks ( until atleast 3/12/06 )
Take your Aspirin 325mg indefinately
Please reschedule appointment with Dr. Kuick to receive steroid
injections for spinal stenosis until AFTER your course of Plavix is
complete

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
89 F Bagreen Con Ri woman with CAD s/p multiple PCI , CHF , anxiety , GER
D , atrial fibrillation , and profoundly demented at baseline ,
admitted via ED on 6/10/4 with SSCP , mild volume overload and
inability to cope at home. Has had multiple identical admissions over
the past year. Felt not to be a candidate for further
coronary iintervention. Admitted for ROMI , gentle
diuresis and mainly for placement issues.
Course:
1. CV:
-Ischemia: Ruled out by 3 sets of cardiac enzymes. No ischemic
changes on EKG. She was maintained on cardiac regimen: ASA , Isordil ,
statin , BB , ACEI. No further risk stratification was performed as
stated above.
-Pump: Mildly volume overloaded on admission. Was gently diuresed and t
hen changed back to baseline lasix PO dosing.
-Rhythm: Atrial fibrillation intermittently with sinus rhythm. Not
candidate for anticoagulation. Was bradycardic ( HR 40s-60s ) but
asymptomatic during course. Atenolol was changed to TID dosing of
lopressor given CRI ( Cr 1.9 ) and worry that renal clearance of drug
was impaired.
2. Psych: Demented at baseline. Continued home meds: remeron , zyprexa ,
dilantin.
3. Prophy: Will continue prophylactic dosing of lovenox at rehab ( not
contraindicated even with CRI ).
4. Dispo: Pt will be discharged to skilled nursing facility after
extensive discussions with family. Pt should follow up with PCP when
ready to leave Wellnorhamcypress Hospital 120-824-5764 Dr. Hamann

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: HOGGE , WILLIAMS DAREN MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Elective right total knee replacement.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70-year-old woman
with multiple medical problems including asthma , interstitial
lung disease and autoimmune hepatitis leading to cirrhosis with
varices , hypersplenism and thrombocytopenia. Prior to admission
she lived with her husband and was independent with activities of
daily living. She was limited by right knee pain. She was
admitted to Roundcleod Valley Medical Center 9/2/05 for elective
right total knee replacement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Migraine headaches , interstitial lung
disease , asthma , reflux , hepatitis A , autoimmune hepatitis
leading to cirrhosis with varices , hypersplenism , and
thrombocytopenia , coagulopathy , chronic diarrhea x10 years ,
status post cholecystectomy , osteoporosis , L4 compression
fracture , osteoarthritis.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Valium.
2. Advair.
3. Combivent.
4. Prednisone
5. Nexium.
6. Propranolol.
7. Lasix.
8. Spironolactone.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient does not smoke cigarettes or drink
alcohol. She is married with four children.
ADMISSION LABS: Potassium 4.3 , white blood cell count 9.9 ,
hematocrit 26.3 , platelets 61 , INR 1.3.
ADMISSION EXAM: First documented by the orthopedic team: Alert
and oriented , afebrile. Pulse in the 70s and sinus. Blood
pressure in the 90s/50s. Satting 100% on 2 liters. Thin ,
elderly woman , faint bibasilar crackles. Regular rate and
rhythm. Abdomen: Soft and nontender. Extremities: Warm.
ADMISSION IMAGING: Portable chest x-ray on 10/11/05 with patchy
opacity in the left lung base , likely atelectasis.
ADMISSION EKG: Normal sinus rhythm , normal axis. QTC 464. LVH ,
T-wave inversion in 3 , T-wave flattening in AVF , T-wave
flattening in V3 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Ortho: Right knee replacement. The patient underwent an
uncomplicated right knee replacement on admission. Subsequently
her leg was immobilized as per orthopedic recommendations. The
reason for immobilization was that movement of the right lower
extremity might precipitate skin tears.
2. Skin: The patient incurred a laceration in her left calf
perioperatively. She also incurred a skin tear on 11/29/05 with
turning in the bed. Her skin was noted to be paper thin with
underlying fluid. Wound healing was impaired secondary to low
albumin and chronic steroid use. The patient was seen by the
Plastic Surgery team. This team recommended appropriate
dressings for the patient's skin tears. The team also grafted
the left thigh skin tear. The patient was treated with
supplemental vitamins to promote wound healing including vitamin
A and zinc. She was also treated with antibiotics to prevent
skin infections. Originally she had been on vancomycin for a
urinary tract infection and when the course was complete for the
urinary tract infection , the patient was switched to Keflex for
prophylaxis versus skin infections.
3. GI: End stage liver disease with varices and
thrombocytopenia. The patient's complete metabolic panel and
coags were checked each day. During the course of her
hospitalization , the patient's transaminases were relatively
stable , but her alkaline phosphatase trended upward. On exam ,
the patient had mild right upper quadrant tenderness which she
reported was chronic. On 5/13/05 , the patient underwent an
abdominal ultrasound to evaluate her right upper quadrant
tenderness and elevated alk/phos. This study revealed a 2.0 x
1.6 x 1.6 cm hyperechoic mass in the portahepatis. This study
also showed evidence of cirrhosis as well as common bile duct
dilation and splenomegaly. A CT scan to further evaluate the
portahepatic mass was recommended. For her autoimmune hepatitis ,
the patient was continued on prednisone. For her varices , she
was continued on propranolol. Her Lasix and spironolactone were
held through much of her hospitalization. On 6/19/05 , her Lasix
was restarted in an attempt to remedy her hyponatremia.
4. Low albumin state: The patient has a low prealbumin
suggestive of decreased PO intake versus decreased synthetic
function of the liver. The patient also has chronic diarrhea and
was thought to be wasting protein. The patient refused ??___??
placement for tube feeds. She was initially on a house diet with
Ensure and Boost supplements as well as MVI and lactinex
granules. The patient was not taking in adequate calories. On
6/19/05 , TPN was initiated.
5. Persistent chronic diarrhea: The patient has a history of
chronic diarrhea. Stool studies including C. diff testing was
negative. The patient was also tested for celiac sprue and this
testing , too , came back negative. The patient was treated
symptomatically with Imodium.
6. GERD: This patient was treated with Nexium and p.r.n.
Maalox.
7. Dysphagia: The patient reported trouble swallowing. She was
evaluated by the Speech and Swallow team on 4/6/05. Her
swallowing function was noted to be intact.
8. Infectious Disease:
Postoperative prophylaxis: Immediately postoperatively , the
patient was initially treated with clindamycin for prophylaxis
versus perioperative infection.
Skin Prophylaxis: The patient was initially treated with
vancomycin and switched to Keflex.
Urinary tract infection: The patient had a series of dirty UA's.
She was ultimately treated with vancomycin for a urine culture
that grew out resistant staph species. She finished her course
of vancomycin on 8/7/05. A repeat UA was noted to be positive
for infection. A repeat urine culture is pending.
Odynophagia: The patient reported trouble swallowing. She was
treated empirically with fluconazole and clotrimazole for
esophageal Candida. This treatment did not remedy her pain in
swallowing. The patient then developed mouth sores. HSV swabs
of these sores are pending. The patient was treated
symptomatically with viscous lidocaine.
9. Pulmonary: The patient has a history of interstitial lung
disease and asthma. She was treated with Combivent and standing
nebulizer treatments. On 8/6/05 , the patient was noted to have
a new oxygen requirement of 3 to 4 liters. Differential
diagnosis was PE versus pneumonia versus volume overload. On
8/6/05 , the patient had a chest x-ray which showed left lower
lobe atelectasis. A repeat chest x-ray on 10/17/05 was read as
normal. On 7/15/05 , the patient was weaned down to room air.
10. Neuro:
Pain: The patient was treated with standing codeine sulfate.
Nausea: The patient was treated with p.r.n. Compazine.
11. Cardiovascular:
Pump: The patient has no known heart failure. In terms of her
volume status , she was deemed to be intravascularly depleted as
evidenced by prerenal urine electrolytes. She was thought ,
however , to be total body volume overloaded. It was thought that
in the setting of her low albumin , she was third-spacing fluid.
The patient was intermittently treated with normal saline and
spa. On 6/19/05 , normal saline was held and the patient was
treated with spa in conjunction with Lasix.
Rhythm: The patient had normal sinus rhythm. She was monitored
on telemetry.
Ischemia: The patient has no known history of coronary artery
disease. She had no chest pain. Her cardiac markers were
negative. Her EKG had nonspecific abnormalities. She was
continued on her beta-blocker. She was not on an aspirin given
her thrombocytopenia.
12. Renal: Decreased urine output. From the day of admission
onward , the patient had relative oliguria , 500 to 900 cc of urine
per day approximately. Her creatinine trended downward from a
value of 0.5 on admission down to as low as 0.2. As noted above ,
the patient was intermittently treated with normal saline and spa
versus spa and Lasix.
13. Hyponatremia: The patient developed asymptomatic
hyponatremia. This hyponatremia was not responsive to fluid
restriction. On 6/19/05 , the patient was treated with Lasix and
spa as noted above. TSH , cortisol and uric acid were checked to
rule out other etiologies of hyponatremia. The results of these
studies are pending.
14. Endocrine: The patient has steroid induced diabetes. She was
treated with Lantus and sliding scale insulin.
15. Heme: Anemia: The patient had normal iron studies , B12 and
folate.
16. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is most
likely secondary to splenic sequestration. An antiplatelet
factor 4 test was sent and is pending.
17. Anticoagulation: The patient had two indications for
anticoagulation. The first was right total knee replacement.
The second was a right lower extremity superficial femoral DVT
discovered on 10/16/05. The goal INR for this patient was
determined to be 1.5 to 2. It was thought that the patient was
at bleeding risk with a higher INR given her known varices and
her thrombocytopenia. From 8/21/05 onward , the patient's INR was
supertherapeutic and her Coumadin was held. It was thought that
the supertherapeutic INR could relate to Coumadin effects versus
nutritional deficiencies versus worsening of her function.
18. Musculoskeletal: Osteoporosis: The patient was treated with
cholecalciferol.
19. Physical therapy: The patient was followed by the Physical
Therapy team.
20. Access: The patient had a PIC line in place.
Discharge medications , the remainder of the hospital course and
disposition will be dictated by Dr. Steven Jaksic

region of the pancreatic head. EKG showed her to be in sinus
tachycardia with the rate of 122. She had a left axis deviation in
Qs and V1.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for pancreatitis , asthma ,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , history
of vascular necrosis of both hips , status post a total hip
replacement on the right as well as a total hip replacement on the
left. She has known coronary artery disease , history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease , history of GI bleed. Status post a
Nissen fundoplication with redo. Hypertension. Alpha thalassemia.
History of congestive heart failure. Chronic low back pain

children. She lives alone.
After admission to the medical service , she was seen by the
surgical service in consultation. Based on clinical findings and
laboratory values , a repeat abdominal CT study was ordered with a
plan for CT guided drainage to rule out a pancreatic abscess. The
CT guided aspirate appeared purulent and was sent for gram and
cultures. Gram stain was positive for gram negative rods and gram
positive cocci in pairs actually growing out Strep viridans and
Klebsiella.
While in the hospital , the patient also developed a urinary tract
infection with yeast , and was started on fluconazole. This too ,
she will be discharged with , to complete a seven-day course. As
well , the patient was felt to have peptic ulcer disease , and was
begun on H. pylori therapy of Biaxin and bismuth , both of which she
will be discharged on to complete a seven-day course. At the time
of discharge , the patient is relatively pain-free , tolerating a
p.o. diet , and afebrile. The plan is to discharge her to the

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Ms. Dinwoodie it was a pleasure to take care of you during your
hospitalization. We have made some changes to your medications. We
increased your blood pressure medication: Lisinopril from 5mg to 15mg
once a day. We started you on a medication for anemia: ferrous
gluconate which you should take 3 times a day along with colace a stool
softener which you should take twice a day. We also increased your lasix
frm 20mg once a day to 40mg twice a day. As discussed with you , your
echocardiogram ( ultrasound of your heart ) showed that you had some
abnormality with the functioning of your heart which may in part explain
your shortness of breath especially on exertion. It is extremely important
to follow up with your primary care physician Dr. Clague appt 7/12 at
12:10pm and your cardiologist Dr. Dodgen on 2/16 at 1:30pm. If you
have trouble breathing , have chest pain please seek medical attention as
soon as possible.

ALLERGIES: Sulfa , azathioprine , sertraline , and metoclopramide.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient never smoked , use alcohol or drugs.
Her son is very involved and confirms that the patient is
DNR/DNI.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the temperature is 98.6 ,
heart rate 70 , respiratory rate 16 , blood pressure 133/61 , oxygen
saturation was 79% on room air and increased in 94% on 3 L nasal
cannula. In general , the patient appeared comfortable with
pleasant and convulsant and blind. Neck showed a JVP of 7.
Chest exam was with left basilar crackles no wheezes. Heart was
regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at
the left upper sternal border. Abdomen was soft , nontender , and
nondistended with normal bowel sounds. Extremities with no
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission were significant for potassium of
4.5 , BUN of 23 , creatinine 1.6 , which is at her baseline of 1.4
to 1.6. White blood cell count of 5.7 , hematocrit 27.3 from a
baseline of 26 to 29 , platelets of 347 , 000. Coagulation studies
were normal. Liver function tests were normal. Cardiac enzymes
were negative. Chest x-ray showed no change in the left lower
lobe infiltrate , since 10/20/06. An EKG showed Q-wave
flattening , but no changes from her prior EKGs. Normal sinus
rhythm.
IMPRESSION: This is an 86-year-old woman with multiple medical
problems including congestive heart failure , diabetes , and
adrenal insufficiency , who presents with recurrent fevers through
levofloxacin and vancomycin.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Infectious Disease. Initially , the source of her repeated
fevers was unclear. Multiple cultures were sent including urine
cultures , stool studies , peripheral blood cultures and blood
cultures from the PICC sputum cultures and induced sputum with
testing for PCP , given her history of chronic steroid uses
without PCP prophylaxis. All of these came back negative with
the exception of one blood culture from the PICC , which grew
coagulase negative Staphylococcus aureus. So , the PICC line was
discontinued and the tip sent for culture , which was negative.
After discontinuation of the PICC line , the patient did not have
any further fevers. The remainder of her admission , which was
greater than 72 hours. The induced sputum for PCP was also
negative and the patient was then started on PCP prophylaxis with
Mepron ( given her sulfa allergy ) to be continued until she had
completed her gradual tapper off of steroids. She completed the
levofloxacin and vancomycin courses , which were started on the
previous admission , for pneumonia and did not have any further
fevers after completing these antibiotics. A PPD was placed ,
which was negative.
2. Endocrine. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism ,
adrenal insufficiency secondary to chronic steroids in the past
and insulin-dependent diabetes. Her TSH was checked and was
normal on admission. So , she was continued on her home dose of
Synthroid. Further instructions through her primary care
provider. Her hydrocortisone was slightly decreased and her slow
taper will be further directed by her primary care provider after
discharge. Her insulin regimen was up titrated with the addition
of the q.a.c. Novalog , given her high fingerstick blood glucoses.
She should continue on this increased regimen after discharge.
3. Pulmonary. On admission , the patient was noted to be hypoxic
on room air with an oxygen saturation of 79% to 80% , which
increased to 93% on 2 L to 3 L of nasal cannula. Given this new
hypoxia and her chronic decreased ambulation , she was sent for a
CT angiogram of the chest , which was negative for PE. The study
also shows small bilateral pleural effusion and mild pulmonary
edema. Resolution of her previous pneumonia and possibly
reactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Given this data , she was
restarted on Lasix with diuresis , titrated to 1 L negative per
day and was sound well. Given this data , she was restarted on
Lasix with the diuresis titrated to 1 L negative per day and
responded well. She had decreasing shortness of breath and
improved room air oxygen saturation up to 85% at the time of
discharge. She is continued to be maintained on oxygen of 2 L
nasal cannula with good oxygen saturation and is anticipated to
have a successful gradual wean from oxygen as her diuresis
continue after discharge. The Pulmonary Service was consulted
and followed her agreeing with the diagnosis of pulmonary edema.
They also recommended a followup noncontrast chest CT in 2 to 4
weeks after discharge to reevaluate her mediastinal
lymphadenopathy after a period of diuresis. A followup
appointment was made with Dr. Soucek at the Chest Clinic at
Sio Sane Hospital for two weeks following discharge.
Pulmonary function test were completed , which showed a
restrictive defect , which the Pulmonary Service felt could be
attributed to her volume overload. An echo showed an increased
pulmonary artery systolic pressure at 47 plus the right atrial
pressure consistent with previous echo done in September of 2005.
Thus , this was not considered to be new pathology , nor likely
related to her new hypoxia.
4. Hematologic. The patient has a known diagnosis of iron
deficiency anemia as well as anemia of chronic disease and is
maintaining on iron and epoetin as an outpatient. There were no
signs or symptoms of bleeding throughout this admission and she
not required a blood transfusion at any point. She should
continue on her outpatient regimen of iron and epoetin after
discharge. Iron studies done on this admission showed adequate
iron repletion with her current regimen.
5. Cardiovascular. There was no evidence of ischemia throughout
the admission. Given her findings of pulmonary edema on chest CT
and her history of diastolic congestive heart failure , she was
started on Lasix 20 mg IV b.i.d. with effective diuresis noted.
This was transitioned to a p.o. regimen of 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
which will be continued after discharge and titrated to her
weight loss. She was also continued on her outpatient Zocor ,
Norvasc and lisinopril.
6. Renal. The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency. She received Mucomyst and bicarbonate in her IV
fluids , prior to her CT angiogram of the chest with prophylaxis
against contrast nephropathy. Her creatinine remained stable at
1.6 for remainder of the admission , which was greater than 72
hours. All mediations were appropriately renally dosed. She
should continue followup with her primary care provider regarding
her chronic renal insufficiency in the future.
7. Fluid , Electrolytes , and Nutrition. The patient was
maintained on any IV fluids except as prophylaxis for her CT
angiogram. The potassium and magnesium were repeated as needed
and she was maintained on the renal , cardiac ADA diet.
8. Prophylaxis: She was maintained on t.i.d. subq heparin for
DVT prophylaxis and Nexium for GI prophylaxis as well as an
aggressive bowel regimen , given her history of chronic
constipation.
9. Code Status: The patient is DNR/DNI and her son John Durazo , is the healthcare proxy.
DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will be discharged back to Mclemens Hospital Of County to continue physical therapy to regain some independence
with her activities of daily living and more specifically to
regain some independence and the activities , which she enjoys
such as playing the piano. She will have followup with her
primary care provider , Dr. Pacetti regarding general plan for her
care including gradual hydrocortisone taper , her Lasix dosing and
her diabetes management. She will also followup at the chest
clinic with Dr. Tobola regarding her PCP prophylaxis and the
possibly of repeat chest CT regarding the question of her
mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen on CT during this admission.

Discharge Date: 10/4/1998
CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient is a 79 year old female with diabetes
on immunosuppressants with fever x one day of an
unclear source.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has a history of diabetes
and of PMR , maintained on prednisone
7.5 mg p.o. q day and Imuran 100 mg p.o. q day ( begun three weeks
ago ). On 9 of June the patient noticed some blood in the sink after
brushing her teeth and she felt that she had coughed this up. A
chest x-ray was done , which was within normal limits. The patient
had felt tired for the last week. Since yesterday morning , she
felt nauseated , anorexic , had some chills , and took her temperature
later in the day and found a fever of 102. The patient also had a
moderate headache , but has no nuchal rigidity and no difficulty
with moving her head. She also has an occasional cough , which has
been nonproductive , for the past few days. The patient has no
other localizing symptoms - no hemoptysis , no chest pain , no
palpitations , orthopnea , edema , dysphagia , abdominal pain ,
diarrhea , hematuria , dysuria , flank pain , vaginal discharge , edema ,
rash , joint pain , claudication or scalp tenderness. The patient
has no moved her bowels for four days , but this is not unusual for
her.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Mrs. Flippen is somewhat lethargic , though
appropriate in conversation. Vital signs:
Temperature 103.0 , blood pressure 140/70. HEENT examination:
Anicteric. The extraocular muscles are intact. The pupils were
equal , round and reactive to light. No scalp tenderness. Temporal
arteries are nontender. The oropharynx is dry with no thrush. The
neck is supple. Chest: Crackles at the left base. No jugular
venous distention. Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs , rubs or gallops.
Abdomen: Bowel sounds are positive , soft , nontender , nondistended ,
no hepatosplenomegaly or masses. Rectal examination: Guaiac
negative. Extremities: No edema. No rashes. No tenderness.
Neurological examination: 5/5 strength in all extremities.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , PMR , hypothyroidism , peripheral
neuropathy , lower back pain , osteoporosis ,
borderline hypertension , history of stroke ( difficulty playing the
piano with her right hand , mild slurring of speech , but by
discharge her symptoms of wide-based gait and slurring of speech
had resolved. )

Inderal 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 20 mg p.o. q.p.m. and 10 mg p.o.
q.h.s.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a retired Hebrew teacher. The
patient lives with her husband in a retirement
home. Tobacco - One pack per day for 20 years. Quit 20 years ago.
Alcohol - Occasional.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's mother had a stroke in her 60's.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies on admission showed a white
blood cell count of 8 , 200 , with 15 bands. ALT
18 , AST 26 , alkaline phosphatase 64 , total bilirubin 0.2 , ESR 55 ,
hematocrit 35.8. Sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , creatinine 1.3.
A spinal tap was done which revealed the gram stain revealed no
organisms , no polys and no epithelial cells. Only one white cell
was noted in the CSF , glucose 92 , protein 46. The patient's
urinalysis showed 5 - 7 white blood cells , 2+ bacteria. The
patient's chest x-ray showed no infiltrates , no free air. KUB
showed no signs of obstruction.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's Imuran was held because it was
thought that this could be a possible cause of
her fever. She was started on Ceftriaxone two grams , Mezlin and
Gentamicin in the Emergency Room. The patient's blood and urine
cultures were all negative , as was the spinal culture. The patient
improved steadily , and the day following admission she had been
afebrile x 24 hours saturating 94% on room air; therefore , the plan
was to discharge her. On the floor the patient received two grams
of Ceftazidime x one and then was taken off of antibiotics.
On the afternoon of 29 of July the patient's oxygen saturation
suddenly dropped. She complained of feeling short of breath and
nauseous. Her room air saturation was 82% when these symptoms
first developed. Over the next 30 minutes the patient
decompensated and her oxygenation was steadily increased; however ,
on 100% nonrebreather face mask her oxygen saturation was less than
80% and her skin appeared mottled. A portable chest x-ray showed
mild congestive heart failure. The patient's EKG showed a normal
sinus rhythm , no axis changes and no ST changes. The patient had
received 100 mg of IV Compazine for nausea; otherwise , no new
medications since admission. Her temperature was 100.5 at 2:00
p.m. Because of her rapid decompensation a code green was called
and she was intubated and transferred to the MICU. ABG showed a pH
of 7.35 , a pCO2 of 44 , and a pO2 of 96 following intubation. Blood
pressure remained , during this time , at 130 to 200 over 70 to 90
with heartrates in the 70's to 90's. During her rapid
decompensation the patient was given nebulizers , but with no
effect. The cause of the patient's sudden decompensation was
unclear. During the period of rapid decompensation the patient got
a total of 100 mg of IV Lasix. Her lung exam showed some crackles ,
but she did not appear to be all that wet. A chest x-ray three
hours post intubation showed diffuse fluffy infiltrates in the
bilateral lung fields , more central than peripheral. No effusion
was noted. Based on the findings of this chest x-ray , a VQ scan
was not done. It was thought that the rapid decompensation was due
to either pulmonary edema ( the patient had been on 150 cc an hour
of IV fluids for approximately 24 hours because she was dehydrated
when she first came in ) , blood , or pneumonia. The patient was
covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime ( for Pseudomonas ) ,
Levofloxacin ( for Legionella ) , and Pentamidine ( for PCP ). The
patient was also given 50 mg of IV Solu-Medrol b.i.d. Numerous
laboratory studies were sent off including: RSV , influenza ,
parainfluenza , VRE , Legionella , PCP , adenovirus , acid-fast bacilli ,
CH50 , and ANA , all of which were negative. Urine and blood
cultures were negative as well. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema was
thought to be an unlikely cause , given that she had a normal left
ventricular size and an ejection fraction of 50% in an
echocardiogram done right after being intubated. There was also no
evidence of any right ventricular dysfunction or RV strain.
She did well over the two days following intubation and was
extubated on 6 of May A bronchoscopy was considered , given the
patient's history of hemoptysis , but as the hemoptysis resolved
over the next couple of days , it was thought to be unnecessary.
The patient's oxygen saturation following extubation was 95% on
three liters nasal cannula and continued to be in the mid 90's once
she was weaned to room air in the subsequent two days. All
antibiotics were stopped while the patient was in the MICU except
for Levofloxacin , which was continued for a seven to ten day
course. The patient was gradually tapered off of the IV
Solu-Medrol and put on a p.o. prednisone taper starting at 80 mg
p.o. q day. The Pulmonary Consult Team saw her when she was back
on the floor for her continued hemoptysis , but this appeared to
resolve over the next couple of days , and , as a result , it was
decided that this need not be pursued at the present. The patient
did well over the next several days and the day prior to discharge
was saturating at 94% on room air and received 10 mg of p.o.
prednisone. The etiology of the patient's sudden decompensation
was never entirely clarified , but it appeared that flash pulmonary
edema was probably the most likely explanation , possibly due to a
viral pneumonia in conjunction with fluid overload.

ATTENDING: AL DAMIAN DUMBAR MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Stented basilar occlusion.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSIS:
None , Q-wave myocardial infarction.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES:
Cardiac catheterization done on 3/14/03.
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
This is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery
disease , diabetes mellitus , hypertension and ____ fibrillation
managed on aspirin and Plavix who presents to the Maven Health emergency department complaining of lethargy , diplopia
and vertigo. Further information regarding her symptomatology is
not currently available as the patient's initial mental status
was quite poor.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension , diabetes , glaucoma ,
hypercholesterolemia , history of alcohol abuse , history of
coronary artery disease.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Not available currently in detail but included aspirin 325 mg and
Plavix 25 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES:
She is allergic to NSAIDs , penicillin and Diltiazem.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:
Revealed her to be lethargic , obese. Her face is slightly
asymmetric with some left cheek swelling. Her neck revealed no
bruits. Her heart was irregularly irregular. Her lungs revealed
bibasilar crackles. Her extremities had 1+ pitting edema
bilaterally. Neurologic examination: The only focal findings
were a transient skewed deviation of her eyes. Further
information regarding this is not currently available. Focal
weakness and numbness were not delineated upon initial
evaluation.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit
given her initial imaging findings. These findings were that she
had an occlusion , flat high-grade stenosis of the distal basilar
artery. There was no acute infarction noted. Based on these
findings , she was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit
and placed on intravenous heparin. Her neurologic status
gradually improved throughout her hospitalization. She did not
complain of diplopia after the first day of her hospitalization.
She also was quite awake after the first day of her
hospitalization. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging done on
10/21/03 revealed a new left cerebellar infarct with persistent
high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery which did appear a bit
more patent than the initial scan done on 10/20/03. At the time
of her discharge , she was being transitioned from heparin to
Coumadin and she was neurologically intact. With regard to her
cardiovascular status , the patient initially ruled in for an MI
based on positive cardiac markers. Her peak troponin-I was 11.02
and her peak CKMB was 18.4. She had lateral T-wave inversions
that were new compared to her old EKGs. She was brought to the
cardiac catheterization laboratory where it was found that she
had multiple moderate stenoses but without any high-grade or
critical stenoses. She was found however to have an elevated
wedge pressure of approximately 30 cm. Echocardiogram done on
10/30/03 revealed an ejection fraction of 60%. She had a mildly
dilated left atrium. It was found that she had moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Her pulmonary artery pressures were
elevated to 51 mL of mercury. She also is found to have moderate
mitral regurgitation. Based on the findings of her
catheterization and elevated wedge pressures , the patient was
diuresed relatively aggressively. She was also given high doses
of beta-blockade. Her troponin and CKMB levels did decrease
after this. She remained weight controlled with beta-blockade.
There was some discussion of possibly cardioverting her , but
given her recent stroke this will be deferred. With regard to
her blood pressure management , she has been managed while at an
inpatient with hydralazine and Lopressor. A decision was made
not to introduce an ACE inhibitor at this time given her recent
_____ and her baseline renal insufficiency ( 1.8-1.9 ). The
addition of an ACE inhibitor may be indicated at some point in
the near future.
DISCHARGE PLAN:
The patient will be discharged to Mitent Health
Hospital.
FOLLOW UP PLANS:
The patient will see her primary care physician , Marco Kenouo ,
at the Department of Medicine on 9/26/04. She will see Dr.
Doyle Ghamdi of Neurology on 2/12/03 at 4 p.m. She will see Dr.
Toney Montagna at the Department of Cardiology on 10/4/04.

6 ) h/o asthma per pt; 7 ) depression; 8 ) fibromyalgia; 9 ) gout; 10 )
gastritis/DU; 11 ) s/p ventral hernia repair. Now , pt described
subacute chest/neck diffuse discomfort and episodic SOB possibly worse
w/ exertion though not clearly related to activity , breathing , meals ,
position , nitro and w/o further associated sxs. Notes medication
non-adherence at times due to depression and not re-filling meds;
includes no lasix x3+ weeks. Seen by PCP w/ SaO2 noted to be 91% on RA
( on home O2 prior but not currently for e/o PNA ) -> admitted.
Overall , evaluated for dyspnea w/ neck/chest discomfort & hyoxemia of
unclear etiology. Performed ABG to confirm hypoxemia: on 3L NC
7.45/45/79 ( Aa gradient elevated at approximately 158 ).
- Suspected DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION in context of ischemic heart dz/HTN
w/ exacerbation due to med compliance including no recent lasix. This
supported by a ) mild improvement w/ diuresis w/ lasix 40 IV qd
w/ resting & ambulatory SaO2s > 93% on 2L and resting SaO2 >90% ( though
decreased to 87% w/ ambulation ) at time of discharge; b ) underlying
CAD/HTN; c ) repeat TTE w/ low E/A suggestive of diastolic dyfxn; d )
crackles though no elevated JVD. However admission BNP=102 & still
some hypoxemia at DC & unclear crackles despite diuresis suggesting
additional process:
- PFTs suggest RVD ( ? obesity/CHF v other ); A-mibi w/o e/o active
ischemia; CXR/CT not suggestive of interstitial
abnormality/thromboembolic dz/PNA; episode of panic w/ more dypnea
possibly further explaining SOB though not hypoxemia. Outpt
consideration of full PFTS , OSA screen , screen for shunt ( not pursued
given correction w/ supplemental O2 )
- pt to follow w/ a ) pulm to see if possible ILD/other despite nl
CT given RVD/hypoxia/RA & consider full PFTs including lung volumes &
consider contribution of possible OSA/hypoventilation; b ) CHF clinic
( discharge weight = 186.4 though no relaible weights established ); c )
PCP; d ) psychiatry to enhance mood and med adherence. Established w/
home O2 transiently at 2L given borderline hypoxemia w/ ambulation on
RA and much improved sxs.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please note that we have intended to make NO changes in your
medications , in case you note any discrepanices , with the following
exception: we increased lisiniopril to 5 mg once a day. It is critical
that you take your medications , including the lasix - seek help from
your pharmacists/primary providers if needed as arrangements including
pill packs may be arranged. It is also critical that you see your
outpatient providers as outlined for continued evaluation though seek
medical attention immediately if you develop anything of concern.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
Consider full PFTS , screen for sleep apnea , adjustment of diuresis
regimen , and TTE w/ bubble if no improvement ,

ADDENDUM
Please note this is an addendum to the previously dictated
discharge summary #6047544.
INTERIM HISTORY: In the interim , since the previously dictated
discharge summary , the patient has continued to progress from a
cardiac standpoint.
HOSPITAL COURSE: His hospital course by system from 10/25/05
through the date of discharge is as follows:
1. Ischemia: The patient had continued to remain stable from an
ischemia standpoint. He continues on aspirin and statin. A
beta-blocker has been added back to his regimen and was titrated
to a dose of Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. The patient has not
been started on an ACE inhibitor secondary to his elevated
creatinine at this time. He has had no further episodes of chest
pain.
2. Pump: The patient's congestive heart failure regimen was
titrated. The patient continues on Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. and
hydralazine 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. for after load reduction. He was
restarted on a low-dose beta-blocker at 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. as
well as digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d. The patient was
aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix and Zaroxolyn
followed by conversion to oral diuresis with torsemide at the
time of discharge. The patient will be followed by Dr. Rayford Hogenmiller in the Clevesa Irvca Sideenandri as well as by the
CHF Service at Sher-ship Rimark's Medical Center . At the time of
discharge , the patient was felt to be nearing euvolemia with
estimated dry weight of approximately 76 to 77 kg.
3. Rhythm: The patient continued to have atrial flutter with a
block. His heart rate remained in the rate of 100 to 110 at the
time of discharge. He had decreased episodes of more rapid
dysrhythmia following addition of beta-blocker and digoxin to his
medication regimen. He also continues on amiodarone at 200 mg
p.o. q.d. As mentioned , the patient was found to have atrial
clot on transesophageal echocardiogram and thus was started on a
heparin drip and transitioned on Coumadin. However , after a
substantial discussion with the Congestive Heart Failure Service
and the patient's outpatient CHF Care Team , it was felt that the
risks of Coumadin in this patient who has a history of
significant noncompliance were greater than the known risk of
thromboembolic disease in the setting of his known atrial clot
and thus the patient was not continued on Coumadin
anticoagulation. Rather , he was given aspirin and Plavix at full
doses. The use of Coumadin in this patient could be re-evaluated
as an outpatient based on the patient's follow-up as deemed
appropriate by his outpatient providers.
4. Endocrine: The patient remained on stable diabetes mellitus
regimen of Lantus 5 units q.p.m. and standing NovoLog 3 units
q.a.c. as well as the NovoLog sliding scale. The patient's
insulin regimen can be adjusted as an outpatient and possibly
oral diabetes medications restarted.
5. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from the pulmonary
with good oxygen saturations on room air at rest and with
ambulation.
6. Renal: The patient's creatinine on the day prior to
discharge was 1.6 improved from the peak of greater than 2.
Renal toxic medications were avoided. The patient had not been
restarted on ACE inhibitor , which could be done as an outpatient
as his renal function stabilizes. His electrolytes were
monitored and repleted aggressively.
7. Hematology: As mentioned , the decision was made not to
anticoagulate the patient with outpatient Coumadin. He was
started on aspirin and Plavix. Of note , the patient also had
decreased platelets in the setting of heparin anticoagulation and
thus anti-P4 antibody was sent. This test is pending at the time
of the dictation , but should be followed up by the patient's
outpatient providers as it may input further treatment. In the
meantime , recommend no heparin products. As mentioned , the
decision was made by the CHF Team who will be following the
patient as an outpatient not to continue Coumadin
anticoagulation.
8. Neuro: Of note , on the evening of 5/2/05 , the patient
complained of left-sided blurry vision , which was new for the
patient. He does have chronic right visual changes. In light of
the patient's known peripheral atherosclerotic disease and atrial
clot , the patient was seen by the Stroke Team for a question of
acute stroke. He had MRI at that time , which did show multiple
old infarcts in the right frontal , right occipital , left
occipitoparietal , left posterior frontal areas. There was ,
however , no new stroke seen on the MRI. The left internal
carotid artery was not evaluated , not visualized on the MRI and
there was concern for left carotid artery occlusion versus
stenosis. The patient declined any procedure such as carotid
endarterectomy or carotid stenting for his possible carotid
stenosis and due to this denial no workup with the CTA was done.
It was felt that because the patient would decline any
intervention the risk of contrast in the setting of his acute
renal insufficiency would outweigh the benefits of the study.
The patient declined any intervention for his carotid arteries on
several occasions. A carotid noninvasives were ordered and are
pending at the time of this dictation to evaluate the severity of
disease.
9. Social: The patient's sister , Alexis Fernendez , is his health care
proxy. The patient in her presence has declined coronary artery
bypass grafting and heart transplant evaluation. The patient has
also declined further procedure for his probable carotid artery
stenosis.
10. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to the Com Medical Center for further rehabilitation. He will follow up with Dr.
Kyle Yandle in the T Las on 8/23/05 at 08:30 a.m. as well
as with Dr. Clyde Chatampaya of Elmert Hospital
Cardiology 10/25/05. He also has a follow-up appointment with
TRISTONTERN MEDICAL CENTER PCP , Raymond Banaag , on 8/26/05 at 01:50 p.m. The patient
requires substantial social support at this time , which is being
provided by his sister.

The patient received care on the Stockvi
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Dilated cardiomyopathy with associated
problems of hypertension and asthma.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: This is a 53 year old female with hypertension x
eight years , who presents with increased dyspnea
on exertion and admitted for left and right heart catheterization ,
and to optimize blood pressure control.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 53 year old Afro-American
female , first diagnosed with
hypertension in 1987. She presented to the Emergency Room in 1987
with acute atypical chest pain , and was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. ETT in 1987 demonstrated chest pain during exercise
and suggestive ST T wave changes in the inferolateral leads during
exercise. The patient was discharged from the hospital , and did
relatively well with intermittent chest pain on exertion.
Exercise tolerance test in 1991 demonstrated consistent , but not
diagnostic of ischemia. No chest pain. Echocardiogram in 1992
demonstrated inferior , posterior , and apical hyperkinesis , low to
normal global pattern of systolic contractile function , and a
celionous redundancy of the mitral anterior leaflet , with only
trace mitral regurgitation.
Since 1992 , the patient has developed severe shortness of breath
with positive chest discomfort of pin and needles in the left
chest , which radiates down her left arm. She notes positive
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with the need of sleeping elevated at
45 degrees at some times.
Echocardiogram in 1994 demonstrated moderately dilated left
ventricle with severely depressed systolic function. Ejection
fraction equals 26%. There was 2+ mitral regurgitation and mild
left atrial enlargement also noted. Mild tricuspid regurgitation
with pulmonary artery pressure estimated at approximately 25.
Due to her hypertension and decreased left ventricular function ,
the patient presents to the Ton Medical Center for a left
and right side catheterization , and also for monitoring of her
blood pressure. Her blood pressure ranged , as an outpatient ,
between 170 to 180/100 to 110.

ATTENDING: LEGGET , BASIL MALCOM MD
Admitted 10/18/05 to Dr. Alan Smaniotto
ADMISSION CHIEF COMPLAINT: Poor p.o. intake and failure to
thrive.
HPI: This 77-year-old female first noted dysphagia beginning in
approximately October 2005. Since then it has persisted and
worsened , and she was seen by a primary care physician. Initial
endoscopy was performed , which was suspicious for malignancy ,
however , the patient was on Coumadin and no biopsy was obtained
at that time. She underwent a repeat upper endoscopy on August ,
2005 at the Arma Healthcare Health The EGD revealed that Ms. Hinrichsen
had Barrett's esophagus as well as a nodule on the distal
esophagus. No evidence of gastritis. A biopsy of the nodule
revealed poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma at 35 cm.
It appeared to be rising in association with Barrett's
esophagitis. She also has a history of ischemic myopathy with an
LVEF of approximately 20% and CAD with a history of bypass graft
in 1992 and a biventricular ICD placed in October 2004. She
underwent an endoscopy on September , 2005 , an EUS revealed that she
had an intramural lesion in the distal esophagus measuring 2 cm
in diameter invading into the muscularis propria , therefore she
was staged and having T3 , N0 , MX , and tumor by EUS. She was seen
at Toards Health in mid July by both Dr. Tyrell Aningalan
from Medial Oncology and Dr. Wahlen from Radiation Oncology. It was
felt that she was a reasonable candidate for consideration of
chemoradiation. She therefore began her chemoradiation and
radiotherapy , chemotherapy including Taxol and cisplatin.
Approximately 1 week prior to admission on February , 2005 ,
unfortunately , she reports over the course of the past week , she
has had increasing dysphagia to the point where she is having
trouble swallowing liquids. She presented for her routine
radiation therapy the day prior to admission , with complaints of
severe lightheadedness and difficulty getting off the radiation
table. She was taken to the ED , where she was found to be
dehydrated and weak. She had some chills , but no fever , no
hemoptysis or diarrhea. She has had very poor p.o. intake and
she notes some weight loss.

10. Hypothyroidism.
11. Peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES: Codeine causes GI upset , morphine and Demerol caused
GI upset , amoxicillin/clavulanic acid caused GI upset , azelastine
causes stinging , and amiodarone causes cold sweats.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications on admission were Lopressor 50
b.i.d. , Diovan 80 , digoxin 0.125 mg five days a week , Synthroid
0.125 mg , Imdur 30 daily , Lasix 80 daily , Prevacid 30 daily ,

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives with her
husband. She is a homemaker. She does not smoke. She does not
drink except for occasionally.
FAMILY HISTORY: She has a father with melanoma , and a mother
with an MI at the age of 59.
REVIEW OF SYSTEM: She had no abdominal pain , no chest pain , no
shortness of breath , no headache , and no joint pain.
PHYSICAL EXAM: On admission ,
VITAL SIGNS: Her temp was 97.4 , pulse 86 , blood pressure 87/56 ,
respiratory rate 20 , saturating 98% on room air.
GENERAL: She was an alert , oriented , cooperative female , who was
resting comfortably.
HEENT: Her mucous membranes were dry , oropharynx clear. Pupils
were equal , round and reactive to right. Extraocular motions
intact.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no crackles or
wheezes.
NECK: There is JVP at 7 cm , low lymphadenopathy. Her neck was
supple.
CARDIOVASCULAR: She was irregularly regular with a 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur loudest at the apex.
ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , with positive bowel
sounds. Her extremities had trace edema with no bruising.
LABORATORY DATA: Her admission labs were notable for potassium
of 2.9 , BUN of 37 and creatinine of 1.6. Her LFTs and CBC were
within normal limits. Her INR on admission was 2.7. Her albumin
was 3.7 , mag 1.5. Her UA was negative. Her EKG showed a right
bundle branch block with A-fib , A-flutter with occasional paced
beats from her pacer. Her chest x-ray was clear.
ASSESSMENT: This 77-year-old female with a history of CAD , CHF
and esophageal cancer presenting with lightheadedness , however ,
having nausea and vomiting , most likely her symptoms are due to
dehydration. Unlikely a cardiac cause given no chest pain , no
palpitation , and obviously decreased p.o.
PLAN:
1. Lightheadedness: Poor p.o. intake and dehydration.
Nutrition was consulted to evaluate regarding the possible stent
in esophagus. She will be treated with gentle hydration
overnight , measure orthostatics , holding Lasix.
2. Cardiovascular: History of CHF with an EF of 20% , checking
BNP and monitor on tele for arrhythmia , continue digoxin , Diovan ,
Lopressor , continue Imdur , continue Lasix while hydrating.
3. Esophageal Cancer: Got XRT. On the day of admission , she
will continue XRT.
4. Nausea: Rx for Zofran and replete potassium.
5. Hypothyroidism: Continue Synthroid.
6. GERD: Continue Prevacid.
7. A-fib: Continue Coumadin.
8. Hyperlipidemia: Continue Zocor.
9. FEN: Replete electrolytes p.r.n. , diabetic diet , and
multivitamin.
10. Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin and Prevacid.
11. Full code.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Lightheadedness: It was felt that all of her lightheadedness
was most likely due to dehydration. Her lightheadedness improved
with hydration , it was most likely due to poor p.o. intake.
Nutrition evaluated her and suggested high calorie supplements ,
however , she continued to be nauseated and unable to take good
p.o. GI was consulted regarding possible stenting of her
esophagus given that she had an intra-esophageal lesion that
could potentially be causing this nausea. She was also ordered
for a barium swallow. On the barium swallow , there was a strict
stenotic lesion of the esophagus , which is not allowed any food
to pass through. An EGD was performed , which showed some food
about a tight stenosis that was unable to be passed. Based upon
this it was felt that she would benefit from a G-tube.
Interventional radiology was consulted and placed a G-tube
without complication. Tube feeds were begun and she tolerated
them well without complication. She has been continued on tube
feeds and is currently at goal of 360 cc four times a day , with a
scoop of promod , these will be continued upon discharge.
2. TIA/CVA: On the evening of 5/24/05 , it was noted that she
had decreased ability to move the left side of her body. Based
upon this , a STAT CT and CTA was performed. The CT showed no
bleeding , and during the CT scan , she regained all function in
the left side , however , the CTA did note a large friable clot
within her right ICA. Based upon her high level of heart disease
and high risk for an operative procedure , it was not felt that
she would be a stent candidate at that time. She was continued
on Lovenox therapy with Coumadin with the plan to discharge her
on medical management for this TIA. However , on the morning of
8/16/05 , she was noted to have a new left-sided facial droop.
She also had some left-sided weakness. A STAT CT , CTA once again
showed no bleed. At this point , the clot was noted to have moved
from the right ICA into the MCA , and to have dissolved somewhat.
Based upon this , it felt that she would have good recovery from
her stroke , and she was not a candidate for any sort of
intervention at that time. She was converted over to heparin
drip with the plan to give her a heparin drip as bridging over
while her Coumadin became therapeutic. She was continued on
heparin drip until her INR was therapeutic. She will be
discharged on Coumadin and continued on Coumadin and aspirin
therapy for life.
3. Esophageal Cancer: She was continued on XRT for the entire
time when she was in the hospital. Conversations between Dr.
Depaoli , Dr. Serl and the family were had and it was felt that she
was no longer a chemotherapy candidate given her poor status , in
terms of her other issues. She will be continued on XRT after
discharge from the hospital.
4. Acute Renal Failure: On admission , she was noted to have an
increased creatinine; it was felt to be most likely due to
dehydration. However , at the time of admission , she had a BUN of
50% and a renal ultrasound was performed , the renal ultrasound
was normal and showed no further defect over the course of her
hospital stay. Her creatinine continued trending down and was
0.9 on the day prior to discharge.
5. CAD: She has a history of CHF with an EF of 50%. She was
monitored on tele for arrhythmia and no arrhythmia was observed.
She does of note have a right bundle branch block at baseline as
well as biventricular pacer with 1 lead out of place causing a
wide complex rhythm. There were multiple alarms for VT , which
were simply her baseline rhythm. In the hospital , she was
continued on digoxin , Lopressor , and Imdur. Her Lasix was
initially held , while she was being hydrated , however , it was
restarted after the G-tube was placed and she was getting
sufficient feeds. She was also continued on her statin. She had
no other cardiac issues while she was in the hospital.
6. Nausea: She was treated with Zofran for her nausea when she
was admitted and she continued to have good response to this.
7. Urinary Tract Infection: On the 25 of May she noted that she was
having increasing pain on urination and increasing burning , an UA
was done and it was found to be positive for infection. A
culture was performed , which showed enterobacter that was
levo-sensitive. She was started on Levaquin and the Foley , which
had been placed prior was discontinued. She was continued on
Levaquin for a 10-day course and this will be continued for
several days after discharge.
8. Hypothyroidism: She was continued on her Synthroid at her
home dosages while she was in-house.
9. GERD: She was continued on Prevacid while she was in-house.
10. A-fib: She was continued on Coumadin , although it was held
prior to her EGD and G-tube placement. During the time when she
was not therapeutic on her Coumadin she was treated with either
Lovenox subcu. or heparin IV drip titrated to a PTT of 60 to 80 ,
therefore she was always therapeutic on her anticoagulin during
this hospital stay.
11. She was initially on a full diet , however , she was unable to
take any p.o. so she was started on tube feeds , which she was
able to make her goal. Nutrition was involved in her care and
she was continued on multivitamin.
12. She was on Lovenox or heparin drip throughout her
hospitalization for DVT prophylaxis. She was also continued on
Prevacid.
CODE STATUS: Full Code , and remained full code throughout her
hospitalization.
COMMUNICATION: There was much communication between her family
throughout this hospitalization in terms of their wishes for her
care and for her discharge , and it was agreed that a rehab would
be a good place for to go at the end of her stay here.

Discharge Date: 11/1/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Ainsley is a 60-year-old woman with
a history of insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and congestive heart
failure who presented in February of 2001 with pain in the left
lateral aspect of her fifth metatarsophalangeal area without
bleeding. This wound has failed to heal over time.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus times
20 years , obesity , hypertension , depression ,
sleep apnea.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 8/23/94 incision and drainage and
debridement of abdominal wound. 4/6/94 ,
debridement of abdominal wound. 10/26/94 debridement and closure
of abdominal wound. 1/7/96 debridement of a chronically infected
abdominal wound in the right lower quadrant. 4/5/97 debridement
of nonhealing abdominal wound in the right lower quadrant. Ventral
hernia repair and abdominoplasty in 4/27/97. 8/1/97 drainage of
seroma with wound debridement and closure. The patient has also
had an appendectomy in 1994 , cholecystectomy and ventral hernia
repair.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q day , Neurontin 600 mg
p.o. q day , Prozac 40 mg p.o. q day , Prilosec
20 mg p.o. q day , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day , Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q
day , Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q day and magnesium supplementation of an
unknown quantity.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Weight 315 pounds , blood pressure 130/70 , pulse 68 ,
respiratory rate 18. GENERAL: She was an obese ,
age appropriate elderly female. HEENT: Extraocular movements
intact. No jugular venous distention and no bruits. HEART: With
a clear distinct S1 and S2. Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs ,
rubs or gallops. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation with no wheezes ,
rales or rhonchi. ABDOMEN: Obese , nontender , nondistended with
normal active bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. EXTREMITIES:
Demonstrated no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. She had radial pulses
2 plus right and 2 plus at the left. Femoral pulses 1 plus
bilaterally. Popliteal pulses 1 plus bilaterally. Dorsalis pedis
pulse was biphasic and so was the posterior tibialis bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the manic vascular
surgery service and she underwent an
uncomplicated debridement of the nonhealing ulcer on the left
lateral aspect of her left forefoot. The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was stable in the immediate postoperative
period. The patient was then transferred to the floor where she
underwent a rapid progressive and uncomplicated course of recovery.
The patient's hospital stay was protracted due to inability of the
patient to mobilize herself with the assistance of physical
therapy. She was screened for rehabilitation placement at this
time but there was some difficulty in placement secondary to bed
non-availability. This immobility is consistent with her
mobilization ambulatory capacity at home as per her own report.
The patient throughout the remainder of her hospital stay had
continued progressive healing of the wound on the lateral aspect of
her left forefoot with wet-to-dry dressing changes. Her finger
stick blood sugars were well controlled. By postoperative day
number seven , June , 2001 the patient was found to have
minimal pain , to be voiding and moving her bowels with ease , to be
ambulating with assistance from physical therapy and a walker , to
demonstrate continued well healing of the ulcer at the lateral
aspect of the left forefoot. She was satting well on room air and
tolerating a diabetic house diet.
A placement in a rehabilitation facility was found and the patient
was discharged to rehabilitation with appropriate follow up and
discharge instructions.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally with no wheezes , rales or
rhonchi. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs , rubs or
gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , obese , nontender , nondistended. Normal
active bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Pulses at the foot which are
biphasic at the dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibialis
bilaterally. The ulcer at the lateral aspect of her left forefoot
was well healing and approximately 0.75 cm in diameter with a well
developed bed of granulation tissue.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4h p.r.n. pain ,
headaches or temperature greater than
101.0 , Prozac 40 mg q day , NPH insulin 60 units q a.m. and 40 units
q p.m. subcutaneously , insulin regular sliding scale subcutaneously
q.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q day , oxycodone 5 mg p.o. q 4 hours
p.r.n. pain , Senna tablets p.o. b.i.d. , Trazodone 50 mg p.o.

Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q day , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day.
REMAINING ISSUES: Primarily mobilization. The patient should be
seen by physical therapy to expand her
ambulatory and mobilization capacity. Her wound should be cared
for with wet-to-dry dressing changes twice per day and she should
follow up with Dr. Aljemal in 7-10 days.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypertension.
2. Anemia.
3. Congestive heart failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73 year old male who
was in his usual state of health until
approximately one to two weeks prior to admission , when the patient
had his antihypertensive medications changed. His nifedipine was
discontinued because of gingival hypertrophy and Atenolol was
replaced. Shortly after that he developed increased dyspnea on
exertion , shortness of breath , especially with walking in the
morning. There was a question of light-headedness. He denied any
chest pain , pressure , or tightness. No jaw , neck or arm symptoms.
No orthopnea or PND. Her also denied visual symptoms or headache.
One day prior to admission the patient was taking a walk and was so
fatigued that he had to stop. On the day of admission the patient
was again taking a walk and was noted by friends to be somewhat
unsteady and diaphoretic. The EMTs were called. The patient was
given Lasix and nitroglycerin with improvement in his symptoms. He
denies cough , fevers , chills , vomiting , melena or hematochezia.
The patient has been taking all of his prescribed medications. No
dietary changes. He notes good appetite , no early satiety. He has
a history of two syncopal episodes in the distant past. On the
morning of the admission the patient has not taken any of his
medications yet.

2. Atenolol 25 mg q d.
3. Aldomet 750 mg t.i.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient quit smoking tobacco approximately 40
years ago. Occasional alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: His brother had a heart attack in his late 50s.
The brother also has diabetes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98 , blood pressure
190/98 , pulse 48. O2 saturation was 98% on
two liters by nasal cannula. GENERAL: The patient is an elderly
African-American gentleman , sitting up in bed in no acute distress ,
talking in complete sentences. HEENT: The left eye has a
nonreactive pupil. The right eye has a small pupil , approximately
2 mm , with a clear cataract. There is no icterus. The oropharynx
was clear with gingival hypertrophy. NECK: Supple , with full
range of motion. There was no lymphadenopathy. JVP was difficult
to assess because of the large neck. CARDIAC: Regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the base. The carotids were
without bruits. PULMONARY: The patient had bibasilar rales with
expiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase. ABDOMEN:
Protuberant , soft , non-tender. Normoactive bowel sounds. No
organs appreciated. EXTREMITIES: Edema 2+. Femoral pulses were
2+. There were bruits. Distal pulses were intact. RECTAL: The
patient was heme-negative.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Sodium 143 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 104 ,
bicarbonate 24 , BUN 35 , creatinine 2.0 ,
glucose 144. CBC shows WBC 8 , hematocrit 32.9 , platelets 343 , MCV
approximately 80 , RDW approximately 16. Admission CK was 175.
Troponin I was 0.05. Chest x-ray showed a questionable bibasilar
infiltrates. EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 56. The axis was 20
degrees. The intervals were 0.175/10/96/0.471. There was LVH by
voltage criteria , an isolated Q in lead 3 , biphasic T waves in AVL ,
and a flat T in lead 3.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By problems:
Congestive heart failure: The patient underwent a rule out
myocardial infarction protocol and subsequently did rule out.
After that he had an exercise echo. The patient exercised for
three minutes on a modified Bruce , achieving a maximum heart rate
of 97 and a blood pressure of 160. The test was stopped because of
knee pain and shortness of breath. Baseline images prior to
exercise showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy , with overall
normal function. There were no resting wall motion abnormalities.
Stress images obtained after peak exercise showed a suggestion of a
posterobasilar hypokinesis. No other wall motion abnormalities
were noted. It was felt that this findings were questionable for
nonspecific finding or ischemia. It was felt that the EKG portion
of the ETT showed no evidence for ischemia. The patient was
diuresed gently with IV Lasix and his shortness of breath improved.
Hypertension: On admission , the patient's blood pressure was
approximately 220/110. The patient was started on IV nitroglycerin
and IV Labetalol in the Emergency Department. The patient was
subsequently weaned from IV nitroglycerin and switched to p.o.
hydralazine and minoxidil , 100 mg t.i.d. and 2.5 mg q d. ,
respectively. The patient had excellent blood pressure control on
these medications. The patient was discharged with close follow-up
in order to titrate these medications.
Anemia: The patient's admission hematocrit was 32.2. Subsequent
hematocrits were very labile , and there was felt to be some lab
error involved. Follow-up hematocrit was in the mid 20s. This was
repeated and was again in the mid 20s. He was transfused two units
of packed red blood cells and underwent upper endoscopy. The
findings were gastritis , with some small erosions in the antrum and
a subcutaneous nodules , which was biopsied. H. pylori studies were
pending at discharge , as were biopsy results. The patient was
started on Prilosec 20 mg q d. and will continue with this for
several weeks. Aspirin was held , as the patient's EGD findings
were felt to be consistent with NSAID gastritis. Iron studies
obtained were not entirely consistent with iron deficient anemia.
The serum iron was low. However , the ferritin and TIBC were within
the normal range. Further workup of the patient's anemia will take
place as an outpatient.
Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine increased
from admission value of 2.0 to 2.5. This was felt to be secondary
to diuresis , and the patient's diuretic dose was decreased. The
patient will need to have outpatient follow-up of his creatinine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 97.8 , heart rate
80 , blood pressure 91/52 , respirations 18 , and satting 95% on 6
liters of nasal cannula. The patient was noted to be lethargic
but otherwise had no acute distress. He was oriented to person
and place. Lungs examination revealed a few basilar crackles ,
but otherwise was clear. Cardiac examination had a regular rate
and rhythm with 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at left sternal
border nonradiating. Abdomen was unremarkable. His right knee
had a large effusion with erythema , tenderness to palpation , and
limited range of motion.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for a sodium of 132; a
potassium of 5.1; and a creatinine of 4.0 , up from a baseline of
1.5. White count was 11 , hematocrit was 37.6 , and platelets were
217. Lactic acid was 0.8. Troponin was 0.71. LFTs were within
normal limits.
DIAGNOSTIC DATA: Chest x-ray revealed poor inspiratory effort
and question of left lingular infiltrate , mild pulmonary edema ,
and a calcified left anterior descending artery. EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm with incomplete right-bundle branch block , 2
to 3 mm SCD depression in the V3 through V5.
Micro from January , 2005 , Staphylococcus aureus with
sensitivities pending. Blood cultures form January , 2005 ,
Gram-positive cocci , speciation and sensitivities pending.
IMPRESSION: This is an 82-year-old gentleman with septic shock
likely secondary to infection of his right prosthetic knee
complicated by bacteremia , acute renal failure , myocardial
injury , and mental status changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Infectious Disease. The patient was found to have MRSA ,
septic arthritis complicated by septic shock , bacteremia and
acute renal failure. He was brought to the operating room with
removal of his prosthetic knee and debridement of his surrounding
area with drain replacement. He was started on a 42-day course
of vancomycin 1 g q.12h. and is currently on day #18 as of
February , 2005. He was also noted to have pneumonia on the
left side that bronchoscopy was also thought to be MRSA
pneumonia. Per ID consult , he was started the linezolid for
better lung penetration and is currently on day #8 of 14. He has
been afebrile now with negative cultures since then. Of note , on
bronchoscopy , there was cytopathic changes consistent with HSV
infection , and he was treated with a course of acyclovir also per
infectious disease this is probably unnecessary and presented
contamination from an old lesion.
2. Pulmonary. The patient had a nosocomial pneumonia with MRSA
and was intubated for inability to handle secretions and mental
status changes. He had a tracheostomy placed and has been
tolerating that breathing on trach collar during the day and
resting on pressure support of 5 and 5 overnight. BBG are
followed with a PC02 goal of less than 55 and a pH of greater
than 7.30 when these were correlated to his arterial blood gas.
3. Cardiovascular. The patient was noted to be in distributive
shock on Neo-Synephrine with a troponin leak secondary to demand
physiology. He had an echo performed , which demonstrated
diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction. He also
had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response in the setting of an acute septic shock. He is
currently in normal sinus rhythm with cardiac enzymes having
resolved. He has been maintained on aspirin , Lipitor , and
Lopressor for blood pressure and rate control.
4. Renal. The patient was noted to be in acute renal failure ,
which is now resolved and with a creatinine at back to baseline
of 1.2 to 1.5.
5. Hematology. The patient has anemia of chronic disease with
crit at baseline of 30. He should be transfused for transfusion
goal of 26 , although there has been no evidence of acute blood
loss during his hospital course other than perioperative excepted
acute drop in crit which is now resolved.
6. Endocrine. The patient was on 50 units of Lantus as an
outpatient but did have episodes of hypoglycemia in the setting
of sepsis and poor nutritional status. He is currently on Lantus
20 units , which can be slowly increased if his blood sugars are
running high. Additional glucose management can be maintained
with sliding scale insulin.
7. Pain/Psych. The patient had peristent delirium likely the
combination of infection pain , ICU delirium , and treatment with
Versed and fentanyl. He had a head CT , which was negative for
any acute process , and once his intravenous narcotic and
benzodiazepine were stopped , his delirium rapidly cleared over 24
to 48 hours. The patient is now on a fentanyl patch for pain
control , which can be increased as his sensorium clears and
Haldol was effective for agitation as well.
8. Gastrointestinal/FEN. The patient had PEG placement to
supplement nutrition and has been tolerating tube feeds without
difficulty.
9. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on Nexium and
subcutaneous Lovenox.
10. Code Status. The patient is full code.

ATTENDING: STOMBERG , MARLON MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
The patient is admitted for a right gluteal hematoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with coronary artery disease
status post recent bare metal stenting in August ,
hypercholesterolemia , CLL and peripheral arterial disease and
admitted for increasing right thigh pain and falling
hematocrit at rehabilitation. The patient had a complicated
hospitalization in August where he presented with a severe
right MRSA infection of his right lower extremity. During
hospitalization , he required a revascularization prior to
undergoing surgery and had a bare metal stent placed to his left
anterior descending artery. After his stenting , he underwent a left BKA to
eradicate his left lower
extremity infection and was later noted to have a
right upper extremity clot associated with central venous catheter. The
patient was discharged from the hospital in August on Lovenox
80 mg twice daily and on Coumadin with the plan that his Lovenox
be stopped at the time of his Coumadin reaching a therapeutic
level. He was also discharged on aspirin and Plavix for his bare
metal stent. On the day prior to admission , the patient was
noted to have a hematocrit of 24 at rehab and on the day of
admission the Hct rechecked and was found to be 18. For this , he was
transferred to the Landm Hospital for further
workup. The patient denies any blood in the stool , melena ,
dizziness or lightheadedness. He does note some pain on his
right side , particularly his right upper thigh and gluteal
area. He denies any recent trauma. He felt some weakness in his
right leg but has had no paresthesias or pain. He states that
his leg has been at all times warm.
ED COURSE:
The patient was noted to be guaiac negative and complained of
some mild abdominal fullness. He received an abdominal CT , which
showed a very large right gluteal hematoma with a fresh fluid
levels suggesting acute bleed. The patient was given packed red
blood cells and was noted to have a potassium level of 5.8 for
which he received Kayexalate.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Type II diabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease status
post MI in 1997. He had a nonST elevation MI in 3/29 for
which he underwent catheterization. Catheterization at that time
showed an 80% left anterior descending lesion , which was stented
to 0 with a bare metal stent , 80% diagonal and first diagonal
lesion and a 100% circumflex lesion. The patient has known
significant peripheral vascular disease status post left TMA in
4/3 with fem-pop in 4/3 , left foot debridement in 5/26
and finally a left BKA in 6/26 He has congestive heart
failure with last ejection fraction of 32% , hyperlipidemia , gout ,
CLL status post fludarabine x4 cycles in 2004 in which has been
stable with no evidence of residual or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy , BPH , chronic kidney disease with a baseline
creatinine of 2.5 , and glaucoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
The patient was in no acute distress. Normocephalic , atraumatic.
His eyes were anicteric. His extraocular membranes were intact.
Mucous membranes were moist without exudates. His neck was
supple , with full range of motion. He had 2+ carotid pulses on
both sides without any evidence of bruits. His jugular venous
pressure was approximately 8 cm of water at 30 degrees of
elevation. His lungs were notable for bibasilar crackles with
left side greater than right. Cardiovascular exam: He had
regular sinus rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , and he had a I/VI
systolic ejection murmur at his base. This seemed to radiate to
his axilla. His abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended.
He had normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants , no
hepatosplenomegaly or masses. His extremities are notable for a
right-sided gluteal hematoma with fullness and thickening. He
does have 1+ palpable DP pulse on that side confirmed with
Doppler. Skin was without rash , ecchymosis , or petechiae. His
neurological exam was intact. He was alert and oriented x3.
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact. He had intact
motor and sensation in his right lower extremity along with ,
however , was noted to have a baseline neuropathy with sensory
loss up to his admission.
Admission EKG is normal for normal sinus rhythm , normal axis , old
T-wave inversions in I and aVL and an isolated ST elevation in
lead 2.
Notable studies during this admission included CT of the abdomen
on admission which showed a new right gluteal hematoma with fluid
levels suggesting acute bleed.
ADMISSION LABS:
Potassium 5.8 , creatinine 2.1 , hematocrit of 22.3. He had an MRI
of his brain done on 5/29/06 which showed subacute infarction on
the right anterior internal capsule and chronic occlusion of the
left internal carotid and old left parietal stroke. He had an
echocardiogram done on 10/1/06 with an ejection fraction of
30-35% , trace aortic insufficiency , trace mitral regurgitation ,
trace tricuspid regurgitation and PA systolic pressures of 33+
right atrial pressure.
IMPRESSION:
This is a 62-year-old man admitted for a falling hematocrit with
an evolving right gluteal hematoma secondary to supratherapeutic
anticoagulation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM IS AS FOLLOWS:
1. Right gluteal hematoma. The patient was admitted for low
hematocrit in the setting of being on multiple anticoagulant and
antiplatelet drugs. He was found to have right gluteal hematoma
which was responsible for his acute hematocrit drop. His
Coumadin , Lovenox , aspirin , and Plavix were initially held. He
received vitamin K and three units of FFP to reverse his
coagulopathy. He was also transfused a total of 6 units of PRBCs
for a goal hematocrit of 30 given his cardiac and neurologic
disease as described below. There was no evidence of further
hematocrit drop. Given that he had been anticoagulated due to
right upper extremity DVT and that the indication for
anticoagulation in the setting and catheter associated clot is
somewhat murky , it was felt that the patient would not benefit
from addition of anticoagulation and therefore his Lovenox and
Coumadin were discontinued. He was restarted on his aspirin and
and his Plavix and his Hct remained stable.
2. Non-ST-elevation MI. The patient was admitted in August
and was known to have three-vessel coronary disease and had
underwent stenting of his LAD with a bare metal stent on
6/28/06. After discussion with the cardiologist , he was stopped
on aspirin and Plavix given the evolution of hematoma and his
acute hematocrit drop. During his lowest hematocrit period , the
patient was noted to have lateral ST depressions and this
corresponded to a troponin leak with a peak troponin of 2.46.
The etiology of this was felt to be demand related to his
profound anemia and on correction of his anemia , the patient's ST
depressions resolved fully and his troponins trended downward.
The patient was known to have a presumed ischemic cardiomyopathy
following his nonST elevation MI. He was found to have an
ejection fraction of 30-35%. He will
need to have a repeat echocardiogram done in one month's time to
assess whether or not he would benefit from an implantable
cardiac defibrillator. The patient's blood pressure medications
were adjusted as follows. His blood pressure medications were
initially held due to his stroke-like symptoms at the time of
admission when his low hematocrit. As detailed below , however ,
they were slowly added back. He tolerated slow titration of
beta-blocker to goal heart rate and also addition of an ACE
inhibitor which was felt to be important given his extensive peripheral
vascular disease and his
low ejection fraction.
3. Recrudescence of stroke-like symptoms in the setting of the
patient's acute hematocrit drop. The patient was noted to have
worsening slurred speech and a right facial droop. He does carry
a history of left internal carotid occlusion and left-sided
stroke in the past. The Neurology team was consulted for these acute deficits
and requested an MRI. The MRI showed basically old known strokes and a
subacute right
internal capsule stroke that was felt to be unrelated to his
current symptomatology. He initially had his
antihypertensives to allow for maximal perfusion pressure. However , as
his coagulopathy resolved , it was felt that the stress that
resulted in the recrudescence of his old stroke-like symptoms was
resolved and he was able tolerate , further addition of his
antihypertensives without further incident.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was seen by physical therapy and given his recent
below the knee amputation , it was felt to be best served by going
back to rehab.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: His discharged medications are as
follows:
1. Tylenol 650 mg q.4h. p.r.n. pain.
2. Aspirin 325 mg daily.
3. Colace 100 mg twice daily.
4. Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously daily.
5. Nexium 40 mg daily.
6. Lasix 80 mg in the morning and 40 mg at night which his IO
goals should be about -500 cc of fluid per day.
7. Neurontin 100 mg b.i.d.
8. Aspart 10 units subcutaneous with meals.
9. Aspart sliding scale.
9. Glargine 42 units daily.
10. Xalatan one drop.
11. Lisinopril 15 mg daily.
12. Toprol-XL 200 mg daily.
13. Niferex 150 mg daily.
14. Zocor 40 mg at night.
15. Flomax 0.4 mg daily.
16. Multivitamin one tablet daily.
17. Zinc 220 mg daily.
18. Plavix 75 mg po daily
FOLLOW-UP PLAN:
The patient is to call his primary care physician , Dr. Lupe Bario and his cardiologist , Dr. Mraw , following
discharge from rehabilitation. At that time , he should have
repeat echocardiogram to assess his candidacy for an implantable
cardiac defibrillator.

been at an office visit on the date of admission with Dr. Rudicil
and began to experience terrible chest pain and Dr. Nacke
referred her to the Clare Taho Medical Center ED for an urgent
evaluation. In the ED , she was noted to be afebrile with a
temperature of 98 , blood pressure 91/54 , respirations 16 , and
satting 98% on 2 liters. She was noted on EKG to be in normal
sinus rhythm with 2-mm ST depressions in II , III , and aVF V4
through V6. She was given aspirin , morphine , metoprolol ,
Mucomyst , Ativan , nitroglycerin and was made pain-free and was
sent to the cath lab for the concern that her stent to the
diagonal #1 placed 6/21/04 was no longer patent , as a cause for
her unstable angina. She had been recently told that no further
intervention was possible after her stent to the diagonal #1.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease
status post CABG in 1996 , which involved LIMA to LAD ( free ) and
SVG to OM1. Peripheral vascular disease. Status post FEM-POP and
fem-fem bypass in 2003. End-stage renal disease status post
cadaveric renal transplant in 1987 , currently immunosuppressed.
IDDM , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , retinopathy , TIA , lower GI
bleed , chronic diarrhea , CMV colitis , anemia , and bladder CA ,
recent diagnosis not yet worked up.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 81 mg , azathioprine 50 mg a
day , calcium carbonate 650 mg b.i.d. , Colace 150 mg b.i.d. ,
lispro sliding scale , Lantus , multivitamin , folate , Lopressor 25
mg t.i.d. , prednisone 5 mg a day , Zocor 80 mg q.h.s. , Plavix 75
mg q. day as well as Zetia 10 mg a day.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa , Benadryl , penicillin , and Compazine.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her husband and has two children.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On admission , Ms. Ameling was taken to the
cardiac catheterization suite where it was found that her
circumflex was 60% , which had been 60% stenosis , now 100%
stenosed. Her diagonal #1 status post stent was now 100%
stenosed and all other native disease and graft disease was
unchanged. Her right heart cath revealed elevated filling
pressures and PTCA and stent was carried out of the occluded
diagonal #1 stent as well as the LAD , but she became hypotensive ,
bradycardic , and developed cardiogenic shock requiring CPR and
intubation. She had an IBP placed and subsequently an echo was
done to rule out effusion and was negative , but had an apparently
low EF. She had suspected transient decrease in flow to her
septal arteries and this likely compounded her acute myocardial
infarction. Following insertion of the intraaortic balloon pump ,
it was noted that she had absent pulses in her right foot , which
was noted also to be cool to touch. She was transferred to the
CCU , intubated and sedated , unresponsive.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her JVP was elevated. Her lungs had
coarse breath sounds anterolaterally , but without crackles or
wheezes. Her heart was regular , tachycardic with a gallop and a
3/6 harsh systolic murmur at the base of her heart and a 2/6
holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla. She had somewhat
decreased bowel sounds , but her belly was soft and nondistended.
Her bilateral lower extremities were cool with absent pulses in
her feet to palpation and her right foot was mottled and was
notably cooler without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Her CK was over 100 , MB 7 , troponin 0.92 , INR
0.9 , and platelets 191 , 000. She later developed acute renal
failure and dialysis was initiated on Monday , Wednesday , and
Friday schedule. Her echo showed an EF of 30% with severe MR as
well as inferoseptal and inferior akinesis. The balloon pump was
eventually taken out , the dopamine drip was discontinued. She
was stabilized and extubated. She was stable for several days ,
but on 9/1/04 in the evening experienced an episode of unstable
VT arrest requiring shock x 1. no further defibrillation was
needed. She stabilized after her V-TACH arrest and shocking and
per Electrophysiology Service , she was loaded with amiodarone and
has been continued on 200 mg p.o. q.6h. after being titrated off
her amiodarone drip.
BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: Ms. Quigg has terrible coronary artery disease
and no further intervention can be offered to her after
discussion with both Dr. Kohler 's Surgical team and the EP
Service. She should not undergo any further catheterizations or
revascularization. She is currently on Aspirin , Plavix ,
Lopressor , and Zocor. She was briefly on Lipitor , but this was
discontinued after a bump in her LFTs. She is not on an ACE or
an ARB secondary to her acute renal failure and at the time of
this dictation her renal function remains poor and there are no
plans to restart an ACE inhibitor or ARB.
b. Pump: Ms. Livernoche has ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe
MR and she is undergoing ultrafiltration and regularly is getting
several liters per hemodialysis session as her blood pressure
tolerates.
c. Rhythm: Ms. Mcelhiney had an episode of ischemic and unstable
ventricular tachycardia requiring shocking. Electrophysiology
evaluated her for the possibility of an AICD placement , but this
has been deferred for now and it is unlikely that she will ever
have an AICD placed , certainly not on this hospitalization. She
has been loaded with amiodarone and is currently on 800 mg a day ,
split into 200 mg q.6h. p.o. and after 10 days she should be
changed to 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. This will take place on February She initially tolerated amiodarone very poorly secondary
to nausea , so her dose was titrated up gradually.
c. Peripheral vascular disease: Ms. Fassett has extensive
peripheral vascular disease and Vascular Surgery is following her
for a likely compartment syndrome in her right calf secondary to
ischemia upon insertion of intraaortic balloon pump. She is
having the circumferences of her cath measured once or twice a
day and these have not been increasing , have in fact been
decreasing. Also , her creatinine kinase levels have been
followed as a surrogate for compartment syndrome and these have
been decreasing and are currently normal. At the time of this
dictation , her CK was 75 down from the 10 , 000 range. She was on
heparin for some time and although her cath continues to be
tender , the pain has improved and the function has gradually
returned. Her pulses remained poor. She had lower extremity
noninvasive Dopplers to evaluate her arterial venous flow and no
clot was noted in the venous circulation. There was no comment
made on the FEM-FEM graft , however , but no note was made of an
arterial clot. She should have the circumferences of her right
calf followed closely at the place that they are marked on the
right lower extremity.
2. Renal: Ms. Barrete has acute on chronic renal failure. She
was admitted with a creatinine of 2.7 and her creatinine has been
up and down depending on the timing of her dialysis; however , she
is relatively anuric , but occasionally produces small volumes of
urine and this should be followed carefully as well. She is
continuing on prednisone and azathioprine for her transplant and
she did have one positive UA , but this is not being treated
because it is difficult to assess secondary to her extremely
concentrated urine , but should be followed if she does produce
urine. This may be permanent , but it is not clear at this point
she may be on hemodialysis indefinitely. She is on fluid
restriction per renal recommendations of 1000 cc per day intake
and her ARB is being held for now.
3. ID: Ms. Helmy spiked on 11/5/04 to 101.8 and she has
been found to have a line infection with a positive triple-lumen
catheter tip as well as positive blood cultures. She was started
on vancomycin on 4/7/04 and this is being dosed according to
her vancomycin troughs , which are drawn once a day. If her
trough is near or below 15 she should be given one dose of
vancomycin and this has turned out to be approximately every
other day.
4. Heme: Ms. Kornn 's platelets have been dropping from the
100s to the mid 50s since she was started on amiodarone. It is
not clear what the source is. She has had two negative HIT
antibodies , platelet factor IV antibodies , and her platelets
seemed to have stabilized in the high 40s , mid 50s and she is not
showing any signs of acute bleed , but this has been communicated
with Electrophysiology Service who is aware of the possibility
that amiodarone may be causing her thrombocytopenia and the
amiodarone has been continued unless her thrombocytopenia worsens
significantly. She is also on a number of other medications that
may cause thrombocytopenia and these will be followed as well ,
however , it was only the amiodarone for which the timing was
coincident with the drop in her platelets.
5. Pulmonary: Ms. Wenrich has a large right pleural effusion;
it was tapped on 10/14/04 , 600 cc were removed. It was noted to
be transudative. The tap was complicated by the patient slipping
off her bed during the procedure. She was caught and did not
fall , but the pleural effusion was not completely drained and she
developed a small hydropneumothorax. This should be followed.
She also had a CT subsequently to rule out hemothorax and there
was no evidence of that. The pleural effusion is evident on her
chest x-rays with underlying consolidation. There has been no
compromise , however , in her apparent pulmonary status and this
should be followed since it will likely reaccumulate after
tapping , but if she becomes more symptomatic it should be tapped.
6. Ms. Delperdang is on prednisone. For her diabetes , she is on
NPH and an insulin sliding scale.
7. She experienced an increase in her LFTs , her transaminases
bumped to several 100s , and her total bilirubin peaked at 1.8 ,
her alkaline phosphatase also bumped , however , this may have been
secondary to the starting Lipitor and this was discontinued.
They have trended down since then. It is not clear exactly the
source of her increase in LFTs. She has been restarted on Zocor
at a very low dose at 10 mg and this should be titrated up as her
LFTs tolerate. She was on Zocor as an outpatient and we hope
that this is not a class effect and that it is not going to be
related to the dose of her Zocor.
8. GI: Her nausea should be treated with p.r.n. Ativan and
Zofran. She has a Compazine allergy.
9. Code status: Ms. Cubeta is DNR/DNI , but family does desire
that if they may help that pressures in shock can be used.

Immediately after transferring the patient to an ICU bed from the
OR table , the patient went into a VFib arrest. CPCR was briefly
performed until we could charge the external defibrillator. A
single shot of 125 joules lidocaine 60 mg resulted in sinus
rhythm and stabilization of hemodynamics. The patient was
transferred to the ICU for further postoperative care.
ICU COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Neuro: The patient received sedation as required during
intubation. After extubation , the patient was weaned off all
sedating medications and is neurologically intact upon transfer
from the unit.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was externally paced initially
postoperatively with external pacing wires and then was
transferred back to internal pacing with previously placed
device. The patient was noted to be hypotensive on postoperative
day #1 and a levophed/epinephrine drip was initiated and
titrated for appropriate blood pressures. The patient was weaned
off pressors as tolerated and by postoperative day #3 was not
requiring any IV pharmacologic intervention with her blood pressure.
The patient was placed on Lopressor perioperatively and also
received IV amiodarone for previous arrhythmia. Upon transfer ,
patient is internally rate controlled with a rate of 90 beats per
minute and stable on a dose of Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. q.i.d. as
well as amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Respiratory: The patient was weaned to extubation on
postoperative day #1 without complication. The patient is
currently stable on 2 liters nasal cannula upon transfer from the
unit.
4. The patient received perioperative IV fluids for blood
pressure maintenance. These have been weaned to off by
postoperative day #3. The patient received electrolyte
replacement as indicated. The patient has begun on diuresis of
40 mg Lasix p.o. b.i.d. upon transfer from the unit. Of note ,
creatinine is 1.3 upon discharge from the ICU which is equal to
the patient's baseline creatinine.
5. GI: The patient's diet is advanced as tolerated after
extubation and was begun on Nexium 40 mg p.o. daily.
6. Hematologic: The patient received blood transfusions as
indicated , which included 1 unit packed red blood cells on
postoperative day #1 for a hematocrit of 25 as well as 3 units of
packed blood cells on postoperative day #2. Platelet count was
noted to be below 50 on postoperative day #2 and a HIT panel was
sent which was negative x1. The patient has second HIT panel
pending upon discharge from the ICU. Platelets have been noted
to increase to 72 after nadir on postoperative day #2.
7 ID: The patient has had no issues and received appropriate
perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis vancomycin.
8. Endocrine: The patient's blood glucose was noted to be
greater than 150 postoperatively. The patient was placed on
sliding scale IV insulin per Portland protocol. The patient has
been weaned off IV insulin and discharged from the unit and is

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 73 year old male with a
history of hypertension , diabetes
mellitus , congestive heart failure , who has had multiple previous
admissions to Lourdes Memorial Medical Center with exacerbations of
his congestive heart failure , most recently 27 of February The patient
was reasonably well until approximately 4-5 weeks ago when he
initially noticed slight worsening of bilateral ankle swelling.
This has progressively worsened until the date of admission when
swelling had progressed up to his waist. In the last 2-3 weeks , he
also noted slow worsening of his exertional dyspnea. Prior to
this , he was rarely limited by shortness of breath , but does not
exert himself much. Recently , however , exercise tolerance has
decreased to 3 to 50 feet on flat ground. Patient denied shortness
of breath at rest until yesterday evening when he noted slight
dyspnea also associated with a vague chest tightness. Patient
subsequently went to bed , slept on his usual two pillows. He woke
suddenly at 4:00 A.M. the morning of admission with severe
shortness of breath , chest tightness , and a sensation of general
fatigue. He was unable to get back to sleep because of worsened
orthopnea. His daughter called the EMTs who took the patient to
the Pathhydenoa Ryside Community Hospital Emergency Room. His initial EKG showed a
rate of 150 and he was loaded with procainamide after no change
after being treated with IV adenosine. After treatment with O2 ,
his chest tightness resolved. He denied nausea , vomiting ,
lightheadedness or diaphoresis on presentation. He also denied
palpitations during the past few weeks , but has noted episodic
palpitations in the past. He denies any previous episodes of chest
pain or angina. In addition , he denies syncope and presyncope.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Congestive heart failure/ischemic
cardiomyopathy with recent echo of 10/16 with
an ejection fraction of 20% with antero and inferior apical
hypokinesis. 2. Non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
diagnosed in 1988 , treated with oral agents. 3. Hypertension. 4.
Status post varicose vein surgery of the left leg.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg q.day , digoxin 0.25 mg q.day ,
glyburide 2.5 mg q.day , lisinopril 10 mg q.day , Lasix
40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient is a retired ship engineer , immigrated
to the Dayna Sas from Shanpro Owma Street He lives with
his daughter in Li , originally from Monte Terster Go He
smokes 1/2 pack per day x 48 years , stopped when he moved to the
Sy Virgs Lihamdale Alcohol - intermittent binge drinking without
regular heavy consumption.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Heart rate was 120 , blood pressure 90/70 ,
without orthostatic change. HEENT showed
pupils were equal , round , reactive to light. Extracular movements
intact. Oropharynx was clear. Neck showed JVP above the jaw with
a question of A waves. Chest showed decreased breath sounds at the
bases bilaterally with bibasilar crackles. Cardiac exam was
regularly irregular S1 , S2 , + S3 and S4 , 2/6 pansystolic murmur to
the apex. Abdominal exam was soft , nontender , nondistended , with a
palpable liver edge , nonpulsatile. No splenomegaly. Extremities
showed 3+ bilateral pitting edema. Distal pulses were not palpable
bilaterally. Femoral pulses 2+ bilaterally. Neurologic exam was
grossly nonfocal. Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly with pulmonary
vascular redistribution and perivascular cuffing. EKG showed
atrial flutter with 2:1 block at a rate of 135 with
intraventricular conduction delay with right bundle branch block
pattern , as well as poor R wave progression.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular. After patient had been
treated with procainamide in the emergency room ,
he became hypotensive and was subsequently cardioverted. His blood
pressure recovered to his baseline of 90 systolic and he was
started on Ace inhibitors. He was also treated with IV Lasix and
started on heparin. Because of his disproportionate right
ventricular failure , he did undergo a VQ scan which was low
probability.
Patient had recurrent episodes of atrial tachycardia and was loaded
orally with amiodarone. In addition , he had some short runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
After aggressive diuresis , the patient was noted to have an
increasing BUN/creatinine. He was started on IV dobutamine on
14 of July and was continued on captopril and Isordil. He diuresed well
on dobutamine and was restarted on digoxin. The dobutamine was
weaned to off on 11 of January He was restarted on IV Lasix.
On 25 of August , patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a
40% mid LAD lesion , 40% OM , 40% RCA. His pressures showed an RA
pressure of 10 , RV 50/12 , with a mean PA pressure of 34 , a
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , cardiac output 3.0 , with
an index of 1.6 , SVR 1800. It was therefore felt that his
cardiomyopathy which had initially been attributed to ischemic
etiology , was likely idiopathic or secondary to alcohol. The
patient was subsequently transferred to the KH with Swan-Ganz
catheter in place. He was again treated with dobutamine and
Isordil and his captopril was titrated upwards. Repeat echo showed
an ejection fraction of 20% with an unstable LV thrombus. He was
subsequently restarted on heparin , followed by loading with
Coumadin. He was transferred back to the floor on 2 of February and
remained hemodynamically stable on captopril , Isordil , amiodarone ,
digoxin and aspirin. His Lasix intravenous was converted to p.o.
torsemide with good fluid balance.
2. Neurology. The patient was noted to complain of
lightheadedness , vertigo and ringing in his ears after receiving
his doses of captopril. He underwent noninvasive carotids which
showed a subtotal occlusion of his right internal carotid artery.
He underwent combined cardiac catheterization and carotid
angiography on 11 of January Angiography revealed a greater than 90% right
internal carotid stenosis. Following the procedure , he had a
transient 5-10 minute episode of decreased responsiveness and
decreased left hand grip , which resolved completely. On 30 of January ,
he underwent right carotid endarterectomy complicated by a small
right neck hematoma which resolved spontaneously. He had no
further symptoms and was able to tolerate captopril up to 25 mg
t.i.d.
3. Hematology. The patient was anticoagulated with heparin
followed by Coumadin as above , for his LV thrombus , with a target
INR of 2.5 to 3.
4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Patient's blood
sugars were well controlled on p.o. glyburide.
5. Renal. Patient's creatinine on admission was 1.4. His
creatinine transiently rose to 2.2 with aggressive diuresis , but
fell to 1.4 on discharge.
The patient was discharged home with VNA services on 23 of March He
was stable on discharge. He is to follow up with Dr. Seth Scheirman on 10 of February
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.day , enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,

Discharge Date: 11/24/2005
ATTENDING: FABROQUEZ , COY MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Cough , nausea , vomiting , and chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease , diabetes , hypertension , CHF , and COPD who was admitted
on 2/21/05 after presenting to the emergency department
complaining of three weeks of feeling unwell. The patient states
that approximately three weeks prior to admission , she developed
increased lower extremity edema. She also noted increased cough
and shortness of breath. Approximately two weeks prior to the
admission , she doubled her Lasix dose without much improvement in
her symptoms. About one week prior to the admission , she began
to have abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting. She continued to
have cough and shortness of breath at this time. The evening
prior to presentation , she had substernal chest pain , which
radiated to her arm x1 hour. This pain improved after taking two
sublingual nitroglycerin tables. She presented to the emergency
department the following day complaining of shortness of breath
and fatigue.
In the emergency department , the patient's vital signs were noted
to be heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 94/40 with O2 sat 98%
on room air. She was complaining of shortness of breath and
fatigue. Her blood pressure subsequently decreased further to
77/48. At this time , she was bolused with IV fluids ,
approximately 1.5 to 2 liters. Following the fluid bolus , she
developed wheezing and was treated with nebulizers. However , she
became more nauseated and dyspneic and her blood pressure
continued to fall. Dopamine was started for blood pressure
support. When she continued to desaturate into the 80% range and
she was subsequently intubated. An echocardiogram at the bedtime
showed a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25%. In
addition , her labs returned with an elevated troponin of 4.5.
She had a subsequent chest x-ray , which documented pulmonary
edema. She was admitted for flash pulmonary edema and was
transferred directly from the emergency department to the cardiac
cath laboratory. In the cath lab , her bypass grafts of the LIMA
to the LAD and SVG to OMB were noted to be patent. However , all
the other grafts were occluded. No interventions were
undertaken. She was also noted to have elevated right and
left-sided pressures with right atrial pressure of 32 and a mean
pulmonary artery pressure of 51 and a left wedge pressure of 40.
She was subsequently transferred to the CCU where she was also
noted to have a serum creatinine of 2.3 and making very small
amounts of urine. A pH at that time was 7.13. Her cardiac
output , cardiac index ratios were 6.8 to 3. She was treated with
sodium bicarb and Lasix IV drip. Overnight , she developed a
brisk diuresis and her hypotension resolved. An echocardiogram
obtained on hospital day two showed an estimated ejection
fraction of 45%. The entire inferior wall was noted to be
akinetic. The posterior wall was moderately hypokinetic. Global
right ventricular systolic function was severely reduced. She
was also note to have a thickened , calcified mitral valve with
severe mitral regurgitation.
Her CCU course was notable for two positive blood cultures , one
drawn on 2/21/05 and the other drawn on 4/10/05 for which she
was started first on vancomycin and then switched to nafcillin
for Coag-negative staph bacteremia. She was also diagnosed with
a UTI and started on levofloxacin. She was eventually extubated
on 11/18/05. She was discharged from the CCU on 10/30/05 , and
was accepted on to the Cards Aworth Service.

27 , alkaline phosphatase 66 , and total bili 0.2. CK 141 , MB 8.2 ,
troponin peaked at 4.46 and subsequently trended down.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Following discharge from the Coronary Care
Unit: In summary , the patient is a 64-year-old female , admitted
on 2/21/05 , complaining of subacute progressive symptoms of CHF
in addition to a more acute onset of nausea and vomiting. She
presented to the emergency department hypotensive , which was
probably related to dehydration due to decreased p.o. intake as
well as continued Lasix use. When given IV fluids , she went into
flash pulmonary edema , requiring transfer to the CCU and
intubation. The patient underwent emergent cath , which showed no
new intervenable disease , but did show severe MR. She was
admitted to the CCU where she was aggressively diuresed and
weaned of the vent. She was transferred to the floor on
4/13/05.
Her hospital course by system is as follows.
Cardiac ischemia. The patient underwent catheterization on
2/21/05 , which showed 100% obstruction in the SVG to RCA graft ,
60% obstruction in the RIMA to the marginal 1 graft , patent LIMA
to the LAD , and patent SVG to OM1 and OM2. Note was made of
markedly elevated right and left-sided filling pressures. No
stents were placed. We continued management of her ischemia with
aspirin , beta-blocker , Lipitor , and Imdur. In addition , we
started an ACE inhibitor , which had been initially held due to
her hypotension. This was restarted on 10/30/05 for afterload
reduction , given her severe mitral regurgitation. Over the
course of her CCU stay and her hospital stay on the Cardiac
Service , she continued to clinically improve. We felt that her
mitral regurgitation was likely dynamic , related to her CHF flare
and ischemia. We would recommend outpatient echo for further
follow-up of her mitral regurgitation.
Rhythm. The patient at baseline has paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation , on Coumadin. Here , she was noted to be in normal
sinus rhythm. Her Coumadin dose was held for two nights from
10/30/05 to 6/5/05 for planned TEE echo and a small dose of
vitamin K was given. Subsequently , the TEE was later canceled.
We are therefore restarting the patient on her home dose of
Coumadin , but her INR may rise somewhat slowly due to the vitamin
K. We have asked her to have her labs checked on 9/13/05 for an
INR check.
Infectious disease. The patient was noted to have two positive
cultures for Coag-negative staph , one drawn on 2/21/05 and one
drawn on 5/29/05. She was initially started on vancomycin on
2/30/05 and then switched to nafcillin based on her
sensitivities. The plan was to obtain a TEE to evaluate her for
endocarditis. However , on further review of the sensitivity , we
conclude that two bottles represent two different Coag-negative
staph species. We feel that this most likely represents
contamination rather than true bacteremia. This was discussed
with the ID fellow who agreed with our assessment. Therefore ,
the TEE was discontinued and antibiotics were also discontinued.
We asked that the patient have surveillance blood cultures
checked on 9/13/05 while off all antibiotics.
The patient also had a positive UA while in the CCU and was
started on levofloxacin for a UTI. However , her urine cultures
never grew an organism. So , this was discontinued on 6/16/05.
Pulmonary. The patient has a history of COPD. She was continued
on her home inhalers as well as nebulizers as needed. She
received one course of pulse dose steroids while in the CCU for
presumed COPD infection. This was discontinued prior to her
admission to the floor.
Renal. On presentation , the patient had evidence of acute renal
failure with creatinine elevated at 2.3. However , this improved
with diuresis. She also had an MRI of the kidneys to evaluate
for renal artery stenosis on 6/16/05. This showed severe
diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta , but no
renal artery stenosis. The radiologist recommends a CT angiogram
for further work if clinically indicated as an outpatient.
Endocrine. The patient has a history of diabetes and is on
Lantus and metformin at home. Here , we held her metformin dose
and treated her instead with insulin sliding scale and Lantus.
We have asked the patient to restart her metformin upon
discharge.
FEN. The patient's goal in's and out's should be even to -500 ml
per day. We increased her home Lasix dose from 80 mg daily to 80
mg in the morning and 40 mg at night. These doses should be
subsequently adjusted to maintain her volume status as an
outpatient.
Code. Status is full code.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home on 1/7/05 with
VNA Services. VNA should assist the patient with her medications
as well as volume status checks , daily weights , and lung exams.
She has a follow-up appointment already scheduled with her
primary care doctor , Dr. Wagenheim , on 9/29/05 at 2:30 p.m. In
addition , Dr. Rayome of the Cardiology Service will see
the patient as an outpatient. The exact appointment time and
date are pending at the time of this dictation. The office has
indicated that they will call the patient for a specific
appointment time.

mmHg , multiple CHF exacs in past , DM , HTN , clinically in
CHF exacerbation.
PMH: worsening AS AVA 074 cm2 , LVEF 65% , mild TR ,
hypothyroidism , DM on insulin , CKD
Final Diagnosis: CHF exacerbation
Treatment and Response:
Note that it was very difficult to monitor her fluid status -JVP
difficult 2/2 girth of neck , often incontinent so I/O inaccurate , and has
chronic leg edema 2/2 PVD. Therefore , we adjusted diuretic regimen
primarily by how she symptomatically felt and her weights.
Initially treated with Torsemide 200 iv bid , Zaroxylyn 5 mg po bid
( 30 min before torsemide ) , and Aldactone 25 po bid. She diuresed well to
this. Over the course of hospital stay , her creatinine increased
from 1.6 to 2.2 , and though her baseline is 1.6-2.0 , we used this , along
with her symptomatic improvement and return of weight to dry weight of
114.5 kg , to establish euvolemia. For final 3 days of stay on
home regimen of torsemide 150 po bid , zaroxlyn 5 po qd , and
aldactone 25 po bid and had stable weights.
Relevant Data: Weight at d/c 114.5; VS @ d/c 98.0 , 81 , 106/60 , 20 ,
93 on RA; rales at left base
Brief Hospital Course:
See above for CHF related info
In addition , pt was found to have pan-sensitive E-coli UTI - treated with
Bactrim x 7 days. Two days before discharge her initial cough worsened
in severity and became somewhat productive. She never mounted a WBC ,
never was febrile , and CXR showed no infiltrate. Felt to be 2/2
underlying COPD - improved significantly with nebulizer tx and
Robitussen. During hospital stay , she was evaluated for home 02;
however , her ambulatory 02 sat was 94% and her nocturnal O2 sats ( done by
respiratory therapy ) were 89-93%. Therefore , not discharged on home 02 ,
though may want to consider as outpt.

Zestril 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation ,
Tylenol #3 for pain and iron supplements.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile with temperature of 95.8.
Her heart rate was 93 in atrial
fibrillation. Her blood pressure was 124/77. She was satting 100%
on room air. She had an irregularly irregular rhythm. Lungs clear
to auscultation. Her abdomen was distended with shifting dullness.
She had diffuse tenderness. She has guaiac positive stools. She
had no guarding or rebound.
LABORATORY: Her sodium is 140 , her potassium is 3.7 , her
creatinine was 1.1 , her LFTs were all within normal
range with the exception of a slightly elevated alkaline
phosphatase at 238. Her total bilirubin was 1.4 , her lipase was
25 , amylase was 57 , white count was 5.7 , hematocrit was 30.3 , coags
were notable for an INR of 2.1. Her UA was negative with only two

isolated cluster of small bowel with a closed loop without signs of
mesenteric ischemia. She also had a small ventral hernia. The
patient was given 6 units of FFP and taken to the operating room
for an exploratory laparotomy.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating after her
anticoagulation was reversed. She had an
exploratory laparotomy , lysis of adhesions , with an obstructed loop of
small bowel , with multiple adhesions around the closed
loop obstruction. There was fecal spillage due to an enterotomy within
a closed loop. All of the bowel was viable , and therefore no resection was
required. A moderately sized bezoar was removed
from the small bowel in the area of the obstruction. The EBL was 400 cc. She
was given two units of FFP in the OR. She had 1 , 500 cc of fluid as
well as two units of packed cells , about 1 liter os ascites was
drained intraoperatively. Her abdomen was closed with sepra mesh.
She was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
Postoperatively , she had fairly stable vital signs with a brief
episode of hypotension immediately postoperatively. She was
sedated with Fentanyl and Versed in terms of her cardiac status.
Her atrial fibrillation was persistent and she was receiving
Lopressor 10 mg IV q.6h. Respiratory , she was intubated and on
pressor support of 15 with a blood gas that showed she was
oxygenating well. For GI , she had an NG tube in and she was
n.p.o. , had Zantac. GU , she was continued fluid resuscitation.

nutitional support via NG feedings. She underwent a tracheostomy on POD #15.
She then proceeded to make a slow but steady recovery , with normalization of
her body fluid status , hepatic function , and mental function. At the time of
her discharge , her major issues were ventillatory support , with ongoing
compromise from chronic right heart failure.
Tubes , lines , and drains. She had a left brachial vein PICC Line
placed on November . The line was measured at 45 cm. She had a Foley
in place. She had a #7 portex trach tube. She also had an NG tube

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Aortic valve area evaluation HPI
admitted for aortic valve evaluation via catherization. This patient was
scheduled to have cystoscopy and bladder intervention for a possible
bladder cancer as well as TURP at Whee Hospital on 2/1/2006. His
surgeon wanted a pre-surgical cardiac evaluation given this history of
AS. The patient has had not changes in his functional activity recently.
Of note , his past history is notable for 5/23 with a right hemispheric
ischemic stroke. He has been having a gradual recovery: there is no
sensitivity in the left leg , though the motor deficits have improved and
he is able to walk with a walker. When he really exerts himself , he had
episodes of SOB but no chest pain , palpitations , presyncope or syncope.
He does have an unclear history of orthopnea but it might not be of a
cardiac etiology. Of note his activity has not been limited by any
cardiac complaints.

presenting with CP and pressure , lightheadedness and SOB x 3days. Sx c/w
unstable angina vs. coronary vasospasm vs. incisional/pleuritic pain s/p
CABG.
--CV: Patient admitted w/ sx of SOB , SSCP and pressure , diaphoresis ,
lightheadedness that lasted 5-15 minutes per episode , did not radiate
other than to abdomen , very concerning for ACS vs. unstable angina ,
especially in the setting of known CAD and recent 4-vessel CABG ( SH : BCH
-> 1st diagonal and then to LAD , L radial artery anastomosis to distal
RCA , L saphenous vein to left circumflex first major marginal; post
surgery SSUH echo w/ EF of 43% and some basilar hypokinesis , patient
started on amiodarone for bigeminy ). Dressler's less likely at this time
out from post-op.
( I ) In the ED , the EKG on admission showed NSR , 1-2 mm ST elevations in
leads V1-V3 , T wave inversions in V4-V6 , concerning for acute cardiac
process. No comparison EKG for baseline so unable to ascertain if new
ischemia or if ACS in setting of sx. Patient rec'd ASA , nitro x3 w/
relief and 2 mg morphine in ED. CXR was performed showing bilateral
effusions w/ L>R. Enzyme set A was negative. Patient was admitted to
floor , where a repeat EKG was done , which showed changes from his prior
EKG , specifically a new T wave inversion in V3 and trigeminy with PVCs.
Patient reported mild pain at this time. Signs & symptoms were
concerning enough for ACS that the patient was started on a heparin drip
of 1000cc/hr with a loading bolus of 5000 units and his PTT followed.
Home isosorbide was held to ascertain for pain. Records were requested
from Wickstra Hospital , where the patient had his surgery 1 month ago.
Patient was put on telemetry and his home Lipitor was increased to 80
mg , and his home lopressor was increased to 37.5 mg TID. Overnight he was
pain free , and r/o'd by enzymes x 3. His telemetry showed NSR w/
occasional trigeminy and PVCs. Pain may be incisional or anginal ,
lightheadedness most likely patient's anginal equivalent. Cardiology was
consulted to consider the indications for catheterization and risk of ACS.
The patient was asx 10/3 and noted to have some sternal incisional pain
with palpation , no EKG changes observed. Reccomendations were made to send
the patient to ETT-MIBI 4/12 , check fasting am lipids , d/c home amiodarone
from RH for his ? arrythmia. The patient was also started on Lisinopril
5mg at this time and his heparin drip was d/c'd. ETT-MIBI showed no signs
of reversible ischemia , basal wall hypokinesis but which was knwon on
admission. Fasting cholesterol was unable to be sent 2/2 to am MIBI
schedule. Should be tested as outpatient.
( P ): No signs of pump dysfunction though mildly elevated jvp of 6-8cm on
admission , EF post-CABG at LMVH was 43%. Repeat echo was ordered to assess
function though cancelled in setting of unremarkable MIBI and absence of of
sx and signs failure while in house.
( R ): Alternates between NSR and trigeminy with PVCs. Amiodarone from TH
d/c's as not needed for this rhythym.
--Renal: h/o hematuria at MMH , microhematuria on U/A and urine sed on
admission. Will require outpatient follow up. Per LAH noted he would need
renal bx and follow-up though it does not seem appropriate w/ h/o foley and
hematuria. Cystoscopy seems more relevant. We consulted the patient's PCP
and agree to recommend outpatient urology follow-up over renal. Urine
cytology was ordered and collected ( though some lost to collection during
MIBI ). Can be followed as outpatient.
--Pulm: cxr w/ bilateral effusions L>R but which are consistent with a
setting of recent cardiac surgery. Patient noted + SOB w/ pain. PE
unlikely as infection. Exam resolved slightly over course of stay.
PPx: Pt on heparin drip w/ ? of ACS on 9/9 , lovenox held. Haprin d/c'd 10/3
in pm. Lovenox held as patient ambulatory and to home on 4/18

7 ) GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE.
8 ) ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69 year-old woman
with a history of heart failure ,
preserved ejection fraction , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,
obstructive sleep apnea , mild pulmonary hypertension who had an
increase in Torsemide dose from 100 mg b.i.d. to 180 mg b.i.d. She
also was subsequently started on Zaroxolyn two days prior to
admission. She has felt increasingly tired and light headed
without dyspnea. She has had a very dry mouth. She has also noted
a decline in urine output. She is admitted to the short stay unit
on May , 2000 when her BUN and creatinine were 125 and 4.2
respectively. This compared to a baseline creatinine of about 2.0.
She was admitted for intravenous hydration. She continues to
complain of dizziness when she sits up at the time of admission and
her creatinine has declined from 4.6 to 2.1 off all her medications
and with some mild hydration over the first two days of admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Diabetes mellitus. 2 ) Gastroesophageal
reflux disease. 3 ) Gout. 4 ) Congestive
heart failure secondary diastolic dysfunction. 5 ) Diverticulosis
in 1998. 6 ) Obstructive sleep apnea. 7 ) Hypertension. 8 )
Chronic renal insufficiency , baseline creatinine of about 2.0. 9 )
Anemia of chronic disease.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to Morphine.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married. She has five children and
two foster children. She quit smoking around nine
years ago. She uses a cane with walking.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission was
significant for chest examination which was
clear. Cardiac examination was muffled , but you could hear an S4 ,
S1 and S2 with a jugular venous pressure around 7 cm , positive
hepatojugular reflux , 1+ peripheral edema of both legs.
Extremities were warm and well perfused. Abdomen is obese and
soft. There was no cyanosis or clubbing in the extremities.
LABORATORY: EKG showed a left ventricular hypertrophy , first
degree atrioventricular block with a heart rate around
90.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was initially admitted to the short
stay unit and was given fluid for two days and
all of her medications were held. She was admitted to the
Cardiology Service , however on April , 2000 , she had been inhouse
with that being her fourth day. Her cardiac medications were
progressively re-initiated and her Imdur was increased to 120 mg
p.o. b.i.d. Her course is notable for progressive decline in her
BUN and creatinine. On April , 2000 we restarted her Lisinopril at
10 mg b.i.d. She came in on 20 mg b.i.d. She did fine with this.
The next , however we restarted her Torsemide and increased her dose
of Lisinopril. This resulted in a bump of her BUN and creatinine
back up to around 2.8 from 1.9. Because she diuresed a total of
about 300 cc that day , we presumed this bump was due to increase
dose of Lisinopril. We decreased the dose back to 10 mg b.i.d. and
continued her Torsemide. The patient's BUN and creatinine
stabilized then at 63 and 2.8. Because of this response to
Lisinopril , we performed a renal artery scan with results pending
at the time of this dictation. The patient also at the time of
discharge clearly at her driest considering the medication regimen
that she is on. She is clearly orthostatic this morning. She will
be discharged on 100 mg p.o. Torsemide b.i.d. with before knowledge
that she will drink quite a bit more than she does inhouse. She
will be followed up for her potassium , renal function and renal
artery scan by Dr. Mel Minshall

ATTENDING: KRIEGE , DERRICK M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right thigh burn , cellulitis and diabetic
ketoacidosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Hesby is a 36-year-old woman
with very poorly controlled type 1 diabetes and extensive end
organ damage including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ,
right eye blindness , lower extremity neuropathy , gastroparesis
and a history of extensive infections including VRE line sepsis ,
MRSA , abdominal abscesses and chronic dermal ulcers. Due to her
dermal ulcers , she developed left ankle osteomyelitis requiring
below-the-knee amputation. She was transferred from Shiredo Sert Of Valley on 1/24/06 in DKA in the setting of a right thigh burn
and possible infection.
The patient was in her usual state of health until three days
prior to admission when she spilled hot broth on her right thigh
and developed a painful red bullae. She presented to Path Community Hospital two days prior to admission , but still she had an
infection. She was given a prescription for antibiotics , which
she did not fill. The area of swelling in her right leg did not
spread from the original blister area all the way up to her groin
and grossly became more tender and warm. On the day of
admission , she returned to the Threei Cent Hospital Emergency Room
for evaluation. Of note , in going to the emergency room , she
missed her regular hemodialysis. In the Ingsparks Down Health
Emergency room , the following vital signs were noted.
Temperature afebrile , heart rate 60 , blood pressure 150/50 ,
oxygen saturation 95% on room air. WBC 4.3 , hematocrit 38 ,
sodium 126 , potassium 7.9 , glucose 1221 , anion gap 13 , acetone
negative , AST 385 , ALT 127 and alk phos 411. EKG revealed peak Q
waves. The patient was given 20 units of IV insulin and then was
started on an insulin drip 8 units per hour. She also received 2
amps of calcium gluconate as well as Kayexalate and albuterol
nebs. A repeat Chem-7 in the Amoore Medical Center ED showed a glucose of
1100 and an anion gap of 18 with potassium 5.4. The patient was
transferred to the MICU at EH for further management. At the
time of her transfer , she noted left-sided headache , a warm
feeling over her right thigh. She denied any recent fever ,
shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting or
diarrhea. She did note that her last bowel movement was three
days prior to admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. DKA: The patient was stabilized in the MICU on an insulin
drip and was then transferred to General Medicine for further
management. Causes of DKA that were ruled out included the
following - negative cardiac enzymes , unimpressive pancreatic
enzymes , unimpressive lactate , normal LFTs. The patient's DKA
was presumed to be due to her right thigh cellulitis in the
setting of a local burn. She initially was given 500 mL normal
saline boluses and then several 250 mL boluses. As she is
aneuric , her boluses were stopped once the blood sugars were
below 500. She initially was placed on insulin drip that was
then transitioned to NPH and finally to Lantus 24 units subcu
daily. Of note , the patient intermittently refused to take both
her long-acting and her insulin sliding scale. As a result , an
endocrinology consult was called. The patient was noted to be
ordering extra food from the kitchen , which could in part explain
her labile sugars. Despite careful diet and glucose control
efforts , the patient still had sugars at times to the 500s.
Endocrinology continues to leave recommendations about AC
standing insulin in addition to her NovoLog sliding scale and
Lantus insulin. The patient has a history of gastroparesis and
therefore may not tolerate AC insulin very well. The patient's
new covering team will continue to follow up with Endocrinology.
2. Right thigh cellulitis: The patient was placed on Augmentin
and IV vancomycin. Her area of cellulitis has completely
resolved at the present time with slight sloughing of the
overlying skin. The underlying skin is pink with evidence of
good granulation and no further evidence of infection. Given
that her IV access is very difficult , the patient received some
vancomycin , as she finishes hemodialysis every other day.
3. End-stage renal disease: The patient missed her dialysis on
the day of admission. Once in the hospital , her potassium was
very difficult to control in part due to poor adherence with her
renal diet and in part due to her very labile sugars. At times ,
her potassium would rapidly increase to a level higher than 6.5
requiring urgent dialysis. At the present time , the patient has
been dialyzed daily since her admission. She is closely followed
by renal with plans to continue dialysis while in the hospital.
She should not receive any further intravenous fluids unless she
has evidence of recurrent DKA , given her anuric state. Should
she become acidotic , the patient can be managed with sodium
bicarbonate and D5W in small boluses.
4. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , there was no evidence of chest
pain. The patient has showed no EKG signs of ischemia. Her
cardiac enzymes remained negative. Lipids are pending at the
present time. Lipid profile check is pending at the present
time. Pump , the patient has a history of CHF with evidence of
right heart failure likely due to valvular disease in some aspect
of the diastolic dysfunction given her preserved ejection
fraction. Her weight on admission was 70 kg. We did not know
her dry weight. Dialysis is helping to manage her fluids given
her aneuric status. Her O2 sats remained stable on room air
throughout the hospitalization. Her hypertension has been
somewhat poorly controlled and for that reason she was continued
on her home dose of Lopressor 25 q.i.d. and switched to
Captopril , which we continued to titrate at the present time.
Rhythm , normal sinus rhythm. The patient is currently on
telemetry with no signs of arrhythmia.
5. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: The patient was placed on a
cardiac , renal and diabetic diet. She was noted to repeatedly
order extra food from the kitchen supervisor. Nutrition
endocrinology and nursing staff are all aware and are working
diligently to prevent the patient from receiving more than 2000
calories per day as specified by her ADA diet. She is continuing
her Nephrocaps and sevelamer. Prophylaxis , heparin 5000 units
subcu t.i.d. - the patient has consistently refused her heparin.
6. Consent: All interventions require consent from the
patient's medical guardian , Stanley Paneque ( please see number
above ).
7. Code status: The patient is full code and this has been
confirmed with the guardian.
ADDENDUM
Of note , on the night of 10/22/06 , the patient complained of
severe cramping , right lower quadrant pain , which is new. She
noted this pain has increased rapidly in the setting of diarrhea.
Several C. diff studies , which were sent recently have been
negative and the patient has had no blood in her diarrhea.
Presumed cause is Augmentin , which has been stopped. The patient
has continued to eat freely and is passing diarrhea despite her
complaints of 10/10 severe abdominal pain. A CT scan of her
abdomen was ordered , but she refused to take oral or IV contrast.
The results of this CT scan are pending and will be followed up
by the new medical team.

ATTENDING: MORRIS VALLOT MD
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Anemia , GI bleed and CHF exacerbation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with multiple past
cardiovascular medical issues including hypertension , diabetes ,
hypercholesterolemia , nonobstructive CAD on prior catheterization
of 1993 and idiopathic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction
reported at baseline from the Burgthan Hospital to be
45% , prior echocardiogram in Montsair Community Hospital from
1994 reported at 25 to 30% , question alcoholic cardiomyopathy ,
atrial fibrillation. He is status post right MCA CVA while on
Coumadin for atrial fibrillation and peripheral vascular disease ,
history of GI bleed who presented with increased shortness of
breath and cough x several weeks. He noted initial shortness of
breath and nonproductive cough in the end of 9/24 with a
question infiltrate on chest film at that time and the patient
was treated with a 10-day course of antibiotics of unknown
content question levofloxacin with no improvement. Since late
9/24 , the patient reports progressive shortness of breath ,
dyspnea on exertion particularly with ambulation of steps and
when lying down. Additionally , the patient reports a vague band
like pain discomfort over left anterior chest particularly
associated with ambulation of steps and when lying supine. Chest
pain is associated with shortness of breath , but denies
lightheadedness , diaphoresis or recent nausea and vomiting.
Symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath are notably worse
over the last one to two weeks through the patient reports
resolution over the last 24 hours with question of a new
medication that he is unable recall. He denies palpitation or
raising heart rate. He does report orthopnea , denies PND , but
does report intermittent lower extremity swelling. He denies
hematochezia , bright red blood per rectum , hematemesis with
question of melanotic stools over the last month. The patient
also with a history of prior GI bleed while in Lan , West Virginia 39586 several
years prior for which he was transfused 4 units of packed red
blood cells. EGD colonoscopy at that time revealed both upper
and lower GI lesions including several small AVM and
diverticulosis. Additionally , upper GI endoscopy performed at
that time revealed duodenitis.
The patient was seen in a Pleaermount Medical Center today
reportedly in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. He had
previously been reported to be in this abnormal rhtyhm that
converted to normal sinus rhythm while on amiodarone. He was
noted to have rapid ventricular response in 120s. He had
appeared pale. Hematocrit obtained at that time reportedly 21.4
and the patient was admitted to the Nipaul Ingways Community Hospital
for further evaluation.

patient reports no alcohol in the last 20 years. The patient
currently lives with his girlfriend of 45 years and is local to
O Lasmerflinteans Louis
FAMILY HISTORY:
Family history is noncontributory. No history of a sudden
cardiac death.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs on admission include a temperature of 98 , heart rate
of 112 , blood pressure 168/90 , respiratory rate 20 93% on room
air. He was in no acute distress though the patient was seen to
be in shortness of breath when lying at 20 to 30 degrees. JVP on
admission 12 to 15 cm of water , difficult to assess given
habitus. The patient additionally with bibasilar rales ,
one-third to one-half up with poor air movement. No egophony or
consolidation was appreciated. Abdominal exam was unremarkable.
Lower extremities were warm and well perfused. He was able to
move all extremities , 4/5 strength in his right hand. He had
positive peripheral pulses and 1+ lower extremity edema , left
greater than right to mid calf.
LABORATORY DATA:
Laboratory values on admission are significant for creatinine of
1.8 of unknown baseline and glucose of 192. LFTs were within
normal limit. White count of 8.7 , hematocrit of 21.4 , down from
baseline of 30 to 35 and platelets of 351 , 000. MCV on hematocrit
was 84.
EKG on admission showed irregularly regular rhythm at 120 likely
atrial fibrillation versus atrial flutter with variable block , ST
segment depression laterally in V5 through V6 , question demand
ischemia versus digoxin effect , left bundle branch block which is
reportedly the patient's baseline. Chest film with vascular
prominence at the hilum bilaterally , question mass infiltrate
over left lower lobe with no overt effusions.
ASSESSMENT:
The patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with extensive past
cardiac and otherwise medical history presenting to the Mahunt Medical Center with CHF exacerbation , anemia with question
GI bleed with hematocrit in the 20s and question
community-acquired pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient with no evidence of acute
coronary syndrome. On admission , the patient was noted to be in
a rapid ventricular response at 120 and with CHF exacerbation.
The patient initially with complaint of chest pressure , which was
concerning for demand ischemia in the setting significant anemia
with increased heart rate and known ventricular dysfunction.
Cardiac enzymes were drawn and serially were elevated with a peak
troponin I of 4. Subsequent serial cardiac enzymes resolved to
baseline values. The patient was initially started on heparin IV
drip for concern for unstable plaque , but following consultation
with Dr. Slaney in Cardiology , it was recommended anticoagulation
be stopped secondary to recent GI bleed and low concern for acute
coronary syndrome versus demand ischemia. Additionally , the
patient was rate controlled with IV following p.o. Lopressor ,
digoxin and amiodarone. Additionally , the patient's ACE
inhibitor was continued and titrated up to lisinopril 40. The
patient was initially diuresed given significant volume overload
with IV Lasix with diuresis of 4 to 8 liters over the hospital
course. Echocardiogram obtained during decompensated episode
revealed EF of 25 to 30% with global hypokinesis and septal
akinesis , was significantly altered from prior echocardiogram of
9/16/03 obtained at the Wellcamp University Of Medical Center which had
revealed an EF of 40 to 45% with mild global HK. However , of
note , this echocardiogram was similar to prior echocardiogram in
Alehealtdana Bafound Hospital system from 1994 with no additional
wall motion abnormalities. The patient's cardiovascular issues
felt to stem secondary to anemia in the setting of increased
ventricular response and tachycardia , which led to demand
ischemia and subsequent troponin leak causing decompensated CHF.
The patient's symptomatology resolved with proper rate control
and resuscitation with IV fluids and blood. The patient's heart
rate was well controlled in the 60s to 70s and following IV
diuresis , the patient's CHF symptomatology resolved. At the time
of discharge , the patient was ambulating without difficulty with
no oxygen requirement. The patient was transitioned to all p.o.
regimen.
2. Heme: The patient with recent GI bleed with known both upper
and lower GI lesions including AVM and diverticulosis for which
the patient has been previously treated. The patient's
hematocrit on admission 21.4. The patient received 4 units of
packed red blood cells to stable hematocrit of 29 to 30 x 72
hours. In addition , the patient was never hemodynamically
unstable during admission. GI bleed felt to be a precipitating
etiology. The patient was seen by the GI Service , was
recommended further outpatient evaluation and upper and lower GI
endoscopy evaluation as required. The patient to follow up with
Dr. Rosendo in the Erpin Medical Center and outpatient EGD
and colonoscopy to be scheduled for the next week or two to
further evaluate. At the time of discharge , the patient's
hematocrit stable at 29 , no evidence of active GI bleed present.
Additionally , the patient initially held on Coumadin giving
concern for ongoing GI bleed and following stable transfusion ,
the patient's Coumadin was restarted at initially 5 and then
later 3 mg p.o. q.h.s. with INR goal of 2.8. To be further
evaluated as outpatient and INR to be checked on 5/11/04 in Dr.
Paider office and titration of Coumadin as required.
3. GI: As mentioned prior , the patient with GI bleed , thought
to be precipitating etiology of the patient's current
hospitalization. The patient maintained on IV Protonix b.i.d.
and transitioned to p.o. Prilosec 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. As
mentioned , prior to GI consult , the patient will receive the
outpatient evaluation with EGD and colonoscopy as required for
further management.
4. Pulmonary: The patient with history of productive cough ,
fevers , chills. On admission , previously treated with course of
antibiotics , presumably Levaquin for presumed community-acquired
pneumonia giving ongoing symptomatology , the patient treated
initially with IV antibiotics including ceftriaxone and
azithromycin transitioned to cefpodoxime and azithromycin. The
patient to complete full 10-day course of antibiotics for
presumed community-acquired pneumonia. At the time of discharge ,
the patient afebrile , ambulating without difficulty , no dyspnea
on exertion and O2 saturation 95% on room air.
5. Psychiatry: The patient with long tobacco history given
extensive cardiovascular status , the patient received addiction
consultation regarding tobacco cessation. Following
consultation , the patient showing good promise regarding tobacco
cessation. He has expressed interest in doing so. As such , the
patient's antianxiety and depression medications have been
altered. The patient to decrease Zoloft to 25 mg p.o. q.d. from
50 and to continue that for seven days , following which time , he
should discontinue his Zoloft. Additionally , the patient started
on Wellbutrin initially 150 mg p.o. q.d. x seven days , to
transition up to b.i.d. as tolerated within seven days time as
Zoloft is discontinued , recommend further outpatient evaluation
as needed. The patient with several episodes of sundowning
during his hospital course , treated with Haldol with no further
incidents.
6. Endocrine: The patient with known diabetes , maintained on
Regular Insulin sliding scale with good blood sugar control. The
patient to continue on outpatient regimen of Avandia and
Glucophage. The patient may require additional anti-glycemic
medications in future as necessary.
7. Renal: The patient with chronicrenal insufficiency on
admission with a creatinine of 1.8 presumed baseline. At the
time of discharge , the patient's creatinine had resolved to 1.3 ,
thought to be secondary to cardiorenal syndrome in the setting of
acute CHF decompensation , recommend further outpatient management
evaluation. The patient to follow up with Dr. Mcculler in the Lumspe Black Healthcare on 5/11/04 at 1:00 p.m. at which time ,
recommend further evaluation of hematocrit , INR , electrolyte as
required.

This patient is a 72-year-old female with a left plantar fifth
metatarsal ulcer since 3/14 The patient previously had an
ulcer in the same area , which healed successfully. The patient
had recurrence of her neuropathic ulcer and it has worsened and
deepened with progression to osteomyelitis involving the
metatarsal phalangeal joint. The patient's wound healing has
been confounded by longstanding lower extremity edema and as
well as congestive heart failure and venous stasis. The
ulcer has been previously treated with debridement , however , in
5/23 , it became infected and the patient developed left lower
extremity cellulitis , which progressed to the knee. The patient
was treated with antibiotics and subsequently developed profuse
diarrhea and was found to have a Clostridium difficile infection.
The patient was treated with oral Flagyl and vancomycin. She
presents on admission with continued loose stool. The patient
had previously undergone a three-phase bone scan , which was
positive for osteomyelitis and then confirmed by a gallium scan.
The patient has had decreased sensation from bilateral mid tibia
extending distally and denies pain. The patient is admitted from
a rehabilitation facility where she undergoes physical therapy.
At baseline , the patient has poor ambulation and is wheelchair
bound. The patient's cardiovascular risk factors include her
diabetes , venous stasis , coronary artery disease , hypertension ,
elevated cholesterol , and neuropathy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Lower extremity edema and venous stasis.
2. Right knee gout.
3. Ischemic cardiomyopathy , requiring AICD.
4. Status post removal of thyroid tumor.
5. Status post triple bypass coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.
6. Status post multiple myocardial infarctions.
7. Status post placement of coronary stents.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. at night , gabapentin 300 mg p.o. at
bedtime , allopurinol 150 mg p.o. daily , torsemide 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , fentanyl patch 50 mcg an
hour q.72 h. , potassium chloride 80 mEq daily , omeprazole 20 mg
daily , Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , vancomycin 250 mg orally three times
a day , Flagyl 500 mg three times a day , NPH insulin 25 units in
the morning , and oxycodone 5 mg q.4 h. p.r.n. pain.
ALLERGIES:
Sulfa causes angioedema.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
On 5/5/2006 , the patient underwent debridement of her left foot
and amputation of the left fifth metatarsal phalangeal joint. On
10/19/2006 , the patient underwent closure of her wound.
OTHER TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES:
CT angiogram:
1. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease with multiple focal areas of
mild-to-moderate stenosis seen in the origin of the SMA ,
bilateral renal arteries , common and superficial femoral arteries
and popliteal arteries.
2. Occlusion of the mid third of the posterior tibial artery
with distal reformation on the right side.
3. Three-vessel run off in the left leg.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service on
5/5/2006 after undergoing her amputation. No concerning
intraoperative events occurred; please see dictated operative
note for details. She was transferred to the floor from the PACU
in stable condition. The patient had adequate pain control and
was tolerating a regular diet by postoperative day #0. She was
placed on a fluid restriction in light of her congestive heart
failure. The patient's wound was clean with no evidence of
hematoma collection. She underwent wet-to-dry dressing changes
t.i.d. The patient underwent a CT angiogram to evaluate her
lower extremity vasculature; please see the results noted above
in the procedure section. In summary , the patient's three-vessel
run off to the left lower extremity indicated that she would not
likely need a bypass for wound healing at this time. In
addition , because the patient's wound was clean , Dr. Fregeau deemed
that it is appropriate to proceed the closure of the wound. As a
result , on 10/19/2006 , the patient returned to the operating room
and underwent closure of her wound; please see Dr. Visage 's
dictated operative note for details of this procedure. Following
both of the patient's procedures , her pain was well controlled
with oral pain medications. The patient's cardiovascular status
remained stable postoperatively. She did continue on her
home/rehabilitation facility medication regimen for her
cardiovascular issues. The patient remained stable from a
respiratory standpoint. The patient did continue to have loose
bowel movements during her hospital stay. She continued on her
admission regimen for Clostridium difficile , which consisted of
oral Flagyl and oral vancomycin. There were multiple attempts to
save a stool specimen; either the patient did not save the stool
at times or it was mixed with copious amounts of urine. As a
result , a Clostridium difficile test is pending at the time of
discharge and will need to be followed up for test of cure while
at rehabilitation. The patient's hemodynamic status was
monitored closely as well as her fluid status. The patient was
placed on a 1500 mL fluid restriction due to her CHF. The
patient did have a slight rise in her creatinine from 1.4 to 1.8 ,
at the time of discharge , the patient's creatinine was trending
back down to 1.4. The patient's electrolytes were monitored and
repeated as necessary during her hospital stay. The patient
received subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis while as an
inpatient. The patient's cultures from the operating room were
positive for MRSA , and as a result , she continued on IV
vancomycin. The patient is to continue her IV vancomycin regimen
through follow up with Dr. Gittins in clinic. The patient was seen
by the Diabetes Management Service for evaluation of her diabetes
as her blood sugars were elevated on her admission regimen. As a
result , the Diabetes Management Service recommended a regimen
consisting of 25 units of NPH in the morning , 8 units of NPH at
bedtime , a standing NovoLog regimen of 4 units with meals in
addition a NovoLog sliding scale with meals and at bedtime. The
remainder of the patient's hospital course was relatively
unremarkable and she is to be discharged in stable condition back
to rehabilitation with adequate pain control. The patient was given explicit
instructions to follow up in clinic with Dr. Kegerries in one to two weeks.

ventricle was moderately dilated. Overall LV function was low normal ,
the estimated EF of 50-55. The ventricle was
mildly hypokinetic with regional variation and right ventricle
size is mildly enlarged , global right ventricular systolic
function is moderately reduced. The left atrium is moderately
dilated and right atrium is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
is trileaflet calcified and mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation
as noted. Mitral valve is thickened and mildly retracted with
malcoaptation , moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation in some
views. The valve does not appear to coapt. Tricuspid valve is
structurally normal , but severe tricuspid regurgitation is noted
with PA pressures of 99 mmHg plus right heart pressures.
Pulmonic valve is indicated as normal with mild pulmonic
regurgitation. Aortic root size is normal measuring 3.6 cm , PA
arteries normal size , inferior vena cava is noted to be dilated ,
but not pulsatile. EKG on 5/25/05 , atrial fibrillation at the
rate of 70. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 10/10/05 and
underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed 25% proximal
LAD , 30% mid RCA , right dominant circulation. The ventriculogram
showed an ejection fraction of 64%. Hemodynamics PA mean of 22 ,
pulmonary capillary wedge of 7 , cardiac output of 4.0 , cardiac
index of 2.1 and an SVR of 1239 and PVR of 319 with moderate
aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral insufficiency. The
patient was taken to the operating room on 11/18/05 , and
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 23
Carpentier-Edwards magna valve and a mitral valve repair with a
23 CarboMedics AnnuloFlex ring and a tricuspid valve repair. The
patient also had bilateral maze procedure with also resection of
the left atrial appendage , as well as his right atrial appendage.
The patient had two A-wires and ventricular wire placed and was
initially paced after the maze procedure. The patient came off
the heart lung machine on epinephrine , levo , and
milrinone and was taken up to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit and
extubated on late postop day #1. The patient's hospital course
by systems ,
Neurological: The patient remained intact with no focal
deficits , however , the patient experienced dysphasia due to his
tonsil cancer status post XRT , failing speech and swallow and
finally requiring a PEG placement for nutritional support.
Cardiovascular: The patient was status post a maze procedure and
initially was paced and found to be in a junctional rhythm at 60
then recovery of normal sinus rhythm , however , postoperatively
had gone into a rate controlled atrial fibrillation requiring
low-dose beta-blocker as well as anticoagulation. However , he
did see few episodes of sinus rhythm and currently on discharges
in sinus rhythm and rate controlled on low-dose beta-blocker.
The patient did have an echo postoperatively to evaluate his
valve replacement and repair and found to have normal LV size and
function with an EF of 55%. The patient had mild RV enlargement ,
mild left atrial enlargement as well as right atrial enlargement.
The aortic valve was noted to be well seated with trace AI ,
mitral valve status post repair showed mild mitral regurgitation ,
tricuspid valve status post repair showed mild tricuspid repair
with PA pressures of 40 mmHg. There was no pericardial effusion
found and patient will be discharged on low-dose beta-blocker as
well as anticoagulation.
Respiratory: Patient was extubated on late postoperative day #1
and patient was on Lasix for diuresis postoperatively. The
patient , however , on postoperative day #10 , was noted to have a
temperature and culture showed that he had enterobacter in his
sputum and is being treated with ceftriaxone for a 14-day course.
His discharge chest x-ray shows no evidence consolidation and
mild atelectasis at the left base , no pulmonary edema noted.
GI: The patient had a history of GERD and was on Zantac
preoperatively and was on proton pump postoperatively and
switched over to Pepcid for GI prophylaxis. The patient also was
closely followed by the speech and swallow team and due to his
dysphagia status post squamous cell carcinoma resection of his
left tongue and XRT , patient continues to have dysphasia , unable
to protect his airway and by postoperative day #14 underwent a
PEG placement and now at goal of 70 mL per hour to see if he is
tolerating without any problems. The patient however was on
diuresis for a period of time and required few doses of fluid
bolus for his volume status.
Renal: The patient had a stable BUN and creatinine throughout
his postoperative course , was on Lasix for diuresis postop
without no elevation in his creatinine.
Endocrine: The patient was on portland protocol intraoperatively
and switched over to sliding scale insulin postoperatively due to his
tube feeds. He is on regular insulin standing now at 6 units
with sliding scale for coverage.
Heme: The patient was noted to have a drop in his platelets
postoperatively. Two hit screens were sent which were found to
be negative and patient had recovery of his platelets with
discharge platelets of 196. The patient will be discharged on
Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. Today's INR is 2.1 and he will
be getting his preop dose of 2.5 mg tonight and to follow closely
with his INR. He is also on baby aspirin for his coronary artery
disease and patient was not on Plavix for his stent
preoperatively and will not be on discharge.
ID: The patient received vancomycin for surgical prophylaxis.
On postoperative day #10 , the patient was noted to have a
temperature of 101 and was cultured. Sputum grew out
enterobacter and patient was started on ceftriaxone and will
complete a 14-day course of ceftriaxone. The patient during that
time received neb treatments , chest physical therapy and is still
continuing to bring up some secretion. The patient was noted
also to have a heel blister on his left heel which was debrided
and now is very clean and dry ulcer that was evaluated by the
skin nurse and felt that Xeroform would be the best treatment at
this time and the legs should be elevated on pillows to relieve
any pressure off of the heel for continual healing and
prevention or breakdown. The patient is in stable condition and
has been accepted to a rehab bed on postoperative day #20 and
will be discharged to the rehab facility in stable condition on
these following medications.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
EXACERBATION.
PROBLEM LIST: 1. POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA.
2. LUMBAR DISK DISEASE.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. COR PULMONALE.
5. TOBACCO SMOKER.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old woman
with a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the Emergency Ward
with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. She was
intubated for somnolence and worsening respiratory acidosis , and
transferred to the MICU. She had never had any intubations
previously. She is an active smoker with a long history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease who is followed by Dr. Jerald Fenner
Most recently , she was admitted on 8/5/92 for a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation which was treated with
aggressive bronchodilators. Her baseline ABG on discharge was
7.39 , pC02 51.1 , and a p02 of 66 with 91.3% 02 saturation. She had
a previous sleep apnea study on 5/25 which was negative. Her
most recent thyroid function tests on 8/6 revealed an FEV1 of 38%
and an FVC of 51% , with an FEV1/FVC of less than 80%. This was
felt to be consistent with a mixed obstructive/restrictive pattern.
She has been treated with Theophylline and Proventil as well as
home nebulizers , Lasix , and 02 overnight. She continues to smoke
as well as noted above. She has had frequent episodes of cough and
productive sputum as well as lower extremity edema. She now
presents with one to two weeks of increase in her postnasal drip ,
denying any change in her cough or sputum production although she
did note a slightly increased temperature. She began to become
more short of breath and was taken to the Emergency Ward by her
sister. There , she was found to be cyanotic with an 02 saturation
of 59%. Her first blood gas on 50% was 7.27 , pCO2 79 , p02 78%
saturation after one nebulizer treatment. Her peak flows after
three nebulizers were only 90. She began to become somnolent with
a repeat blood gas showing a pCO2 of 94 , and was therefore
intubated and transferred to the MICU. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Was
remarkable for ( 1 ) asthma/COPD , ( 2 ) polymyalgia rheumatica , ( 3 )
borderline hypertension , ( 4 ) lumbar disk disease , ( 5 ) psoriasis ,
( 6 ) right sided heart failure , ( 7 ) spinal stenosis , ( 8 ) sinusitis ,
( 9 ) obesity. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post cholecystectomy
in 1979 , status post back surgery. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Theo-Dur 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , KCL , Lodine 300
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Proventil nebulizers p.r.n. , supplemental 02 q.h.s.
ALLERGIES: SHE IS ALLERGIC TO SULFA WHICH CAUSES HER TO HAVE A
RASH. HABITS: She continues to smoke , and she has a history of 40
pack years. There is no alcohol use. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives
alone. She has two sons. She is assisted by her sister.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , she was an intubated , obese
female in no acute distress. Her blood
pressure was 140/70 , pulse 70-100 , and temperature of 101.6. HEENT
was unremarkable. Neck: Supple with no jugular venous distention.
Lungs revealed diffuse wheezes with an I:E ratio of 1:4. Heart:
Tachycardiac with a normal S1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. Breasts: No masses. Abdomen: Obese , mild tenderness to
deep palpation , normal bowel sounds. Extremities: 2+ edema to her
calves bilaterally , no clubbing. Pulses were 2+ dorsalis pedis
pulses. On neurological exam , she was awake but lethargic and
difficult to arouse , but was able to move all extremities. Her
reflexes were 2+ and symmetric bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride
98 , bicarbonate 36 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.6 ,
glucose 113. Her liver function tests were within normal limits.
Her white count was 9.96 , 76 polys , 15 lymphs. Her hematocrit was
47.6% with 265 , 000 platelets. The PT was 11.4 , and the PTT was
30.5. Theophylline level was 5.3. ABG's were as mentioned above.
Post intubation , ABG 7.45 , pCO2 41 , p02 57 , with 91% saturation.
The most recent echocardiogram in 1/11 revealed mild concentric
left ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular function.
The chest x-ray revealed an increased heart size with no
infiltrates. The urinalysis revealed too numerous to count white
blood cells and 4+ bacteria. Cultures eventually grew out E. coli.
EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with an axis of +8 , right bundle
branch block , inverted T's in V1 and V2 , but no significant change
compared with 11/1
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and continued on the
ventilator until 3/6/93. She was given aggressive
bronchodilator treatment via nebulizers , Albuterol and Atropent.
She was started on IV Solu-Medrol dose which was rapidly tapered on
a p.o. schedule. She also received two days of IV Ceftriaxone to
cover a possible tracheobronchitis. She was also continued on her
Ancef as well. Her urinary tract infection was treated via the
Ceftriaxone. She did well over the next two days and essentially
was ready for extubation on this regimen on 3/6/93. She was
watched overnight and did continue to do well , and was transferred
to the floor on 6/14/93. By this time , her 02 saturations were 92%
on two liters. She was afebrile , and her peak flows were improving
with continued Albuterol nebulizers and Atrovent inhaler. Her
polymyalgia rheumatica remained stable during her admission. There
was a question whether or not her urinary tract infection was
adequately treated as she had several repeat cultures growing 5 , 000
colonies of Staph aureus and one also growing diphtheroids. These
were clean catches. She had it repeated one more time as a clean
catch , and this was found to grow probable Pseudomonas species ,
with an exact speciation pending. This last culture on 5/17/93 was
associated with an urinalysis that was without white cells. Because
of this and because of the low cell count , I did not feel that it
was necessary to treat the positive culture until a straight cath
specimen was obtained. The patient was informed that if her
dysuria were to persist that she was to call Dr. Gigger immediately ,
but that otherwise , her urine was most likely noninfected. She
also received a sleep study on 1/16/93 which revealed that her
oxygen saturations dropped to 46% during REM sleep. This was at a
point when she appeared not to be breathing , and therefore had an
element of essential sleep apnea. She also during periods of
non-REM sleep alternated between breathing against an obstruction
and not breathing at all. This revealed that she also has a
component of obstructive sleep apnea as well. She was started on
Progesterone as an outpatient and will continue to be followed for
evaluation for possible nasal C-PAP. The patient was discharged on
8/19/93 with a continued good airflow and much fewer wheezes than
previously. There were no complications.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Progesterone 20 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Albuterol 0.5 cc in 2.5 normal saline q4
hours p.r.n. , Atrovent inhaler two puffs p.o. q4 hours , Prednisone

Discharge Date: 8/10/1996
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
IDENTIFICATION: The patient is a 71 year old gentleman with a
history of severe coronary artery disease who
presented with unstable angina with probable mesenteric ischemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Cardiac risk factors include a history
of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia ,
remote history of smoking , questionable positive family history ,
and no diabetes mellitus. The patient has had a history of
coronary artery disease , is status post multiple myocardial
infarctions. In the 1970s the patient had a myocardial infarction
number 1 and in 1992 he had his second myocardial infarction , non Q
wave MI , refused catheterization. ETT was done and he was treated
with Atenolol and Isordil. In 2/23/93 the patient had an anterior
myocardial infarction and subsequently had a V-tach , V-fib arrest ,
converted with 200 joules at Mid-ma Hospital and received TPA ,
heparin , Lidocaine , and his peak CPK value was 7975. Echo revealed
an ejection fraction of 20% with anterior apical akinesis , left
atrial enlargement. The course was complicated by post MI chest
pain. On 11/27/93 the patient was transferred to Rahfletchgreenesouth Rehabilitation Hospital Of Cardiac catheterization at that point revealed 90% LAD
lesion and 100% PDA lesion , 90% D1 lesion , and the patient had PTCA
of LAD to a remaining 40% lesion and D1 PTCA with 40% residual.
Post PTCA course was complicated by flash pulmonary edema and
anterior ST elevation which led to emergent cath which revealed a
70% LAD , 100% D1 lesion , and this re-occlusion was treated with
repeat PTCA of LAD and intra-aortic balloon pump. The patient was
given Captopril and Lasix for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Since then ,
the patient was medically managed and in his usual state of health
without any chest pain for the two years until about three days
prior to admission when patient had vague abdominal pain ,
epigastric ache , and cramp occurring intermittently , lasting for
4-6 hour episodes. Occasionally the patient was awaken from sleep.
He denied orthopnea , PND , edema. The patient's pain was similar
to but not identical to peptic ulcer disease pain. The patient
denied chest pain. On 5/25/96 , the patient was seen by Dr. Mcgray
of PVH . The patient continued to have abdominal pain. Patient
had CHF on examination. An EKG revealed new lateral T wave
changes. The patient was sent to Tanjuan Tialan Vition Hospital and there the
patient became diaphoretic , was short of breath , improved with
nitroglycerin and therefore was transferred to Bert Stern Medical Center
In the Emergency Room , the patient had shortness of breath , blood
pressure elevated to 210/110 , heart rate of 118 , continued to have
abdominal pain and development of chest pain typical of angina. He
received Lopressor , IV TNG , aspirin , no heparin secondary to
increased INR to 2.8 , and his shortness of breath subsequently
improved. Chest pain resolved. His EKG had T wave inversions in
V5 through V6.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Significant for coronary artery disease
as above. Status post multiple myocardial
infarctions. PTCA of LAD. 2. Peptic ulcer disease. 3.
Hypertension. 4. Hypercholesterolemia. 5. Status post
amputation of right third distal phalanx. 6. History of
nephrolithiasis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 3 mg q.h.s. , Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
q.day , Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor
20 mg p.o. q.day , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Nitro patch , and
sublingual nitroglycerin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with brother. Retired heavy
equipment operator. He smoked 15 pack years and
quit twenty years ago. Alcohol occasionally.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive coronary artery disease in two sisters
with myocardial infarctions.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature of 98 , heart rate of 72 , blood
pressure of 104/68 , respiratory rate of 16.
Oxygen saturation of 97%. HEENT examination revealed no JVD.
Cardiac examination showed regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur at left lower sternal border. Chest was
soft bibasilar crackles. Abdomen was soft , non-tender ,
nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. A ventral hernia was present
which was easily reducible. Extremities showed no cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema. Neuro examination was nonfocal. Rectal was
guaiac negative per the Emergency Ward.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium of 144 , potassium of 3.5. He had a
hematocrit of 43.6 and white blood count
of 9.8. LFTs were within normal range. PT of 20.2 , PTT of 38.2 ,
INR of 2.8. ABG on 100% face mask revealed 7.33 , 45 , 193 , 99.6% in
the Emergency Room. Abdominal ultrasound in the Emergency Room
revealed right renal stones , but no hydronephrosis , no gallbladder
stones , no evidence of triple A. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly ,
low volume lungs without clear evidence of CHF. EKG upon arrival
in the Emergency Ward revealed sinus tachycardia , T wave flattening
in AVL , T wave inversion V4 through V6 which were new , poor R wave
progression which was old. Pain free EKG revealed resolution of T
wave inversion in V4 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for the rule out MI
protocol. He actually ruled out for a myocardial
infarction with a CPK of 168 , CPK2 of 138 , and CPK3 of 147.
However on 11/10/96 his T wave inversion in V1 and V2 were noted to
be deeper on C set compared to A set. Subsequently that day the
patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema. As his IV heparin
and TNG were being turned down he became acutely short of breath
with bilateral crackles half way up the lung fields. He was found
to be in flash pulmonary edema which was treated with heparin , IV
TNG , and also Lasix. The patient did very well after that and his
troponin level at that point was 0. The patient's CPKs were
recycled and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction again.
His ABG at that point and during his acute episode of shortness of
breath was 7.37 , 43 , pO2 of 111 on 6 liters , and after diuresis he
was able to be on room air without any difficulty. It was
therefore decided for the patient to have cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on 10/4/96 which revealed
proximally occluded LAD , 60-70% lesion of OM1 , and 99% lesion of
proximal PDA , and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction with
extensive anterior apical akinesis and also inferior apical
akinesis. Based on this it was decided that the patient had three
vessel disease. In anticipation of surgical conservation the
patient had a ETT MIBI on 7/11/96 and he was able to go on modified
Bruce protocol 6 minutes. He stopped secondary to fatigue. He did
not achieve target heart rate. His maximum heart rate was 104 and
85% of the predicted value. Subsequently the MIBI results revealed
anterior wall and septum and apex to be nonfunctional , however the
patient had known transmural myocardial infarction in inferior wall
which revealed viable myocardium there and also lateral wall
nonfunctioning wall. These are the preliminary results. It was
decided for the patient to have maximal medical management prior to
consideration for surgery. The patient's Isordil dose was
increased while in hospital and his Coumadin was restarted.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,
Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg
p.o. t.i.d , Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.day , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. q.8h. ,
nitroglycerin 1/150 p.r.n. chest pain. Coumadin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s ,
and Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is being discharged in good
condition.
FOLLOW-UP: With Dr. Ayoub The patient is to be seen within one
week with Dr. Warmack of Gardmond Hospital for
Cardiology , and Dr. Bartolomeo of Thoracic Surgery per Dr. Ondrusek
recommendations. The patient has been chest pain free since
11/10/96 , since he had the episode of flash pulmonary edema. His
heparin was discontinued on 1/11/96. The patient remained chest
pain free with good oxygen saturation and was not short of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69-year-old female
with known coronary artery disease ,
CRF , and history of flash pulmonary edema , recently admitted to
Darnbo Hospital on 6/9/97 after sudden onset of shortness of breath
unrelieved by one sublingual nitroglycerin. This shortness of
breath awakened her from sleep. Her blood pressure in the
Emergency Room was 230/110 without EKG changes. She responded well
to IV Lasix and IV nitroglycerin , saturating at 99% on 100%
nonrebreather mask. Chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary
edema. Her blood pressure was stabilized on IV nitroglycerin with
resolution of her shortness of breath. She was ruled out for
myocardial infarction. The patient was also recently admitted one
month ago to Stonemep Medical Center for flash pulmonary edema without
evidence of myocardial infarction. Echo on admission showed 30%
ejection fraction with anteroapical and posterobasal hypokinesis.
Cardiac catheterization in January 1997 showed a 90% proximal RCA
lesion and diffuse distal LAD disease. During vigorous rehydration
following that cardiac catheterization , she developed recurrent
pulmonary edema requiring intubation from which she was weaned
following diuresis. Because her pulmonary edema was believed to be
ischemia related , she was transferred to the Ha Hospital for RCA angioplasty. On this admission , she denies any
chest pain , shortness of breath , or dizziness. She has three
pillow orthopnea , ankle edema. She denies any paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea with the exception of her current presentation. The
patient's coronary risk factors include diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , post menopausal status without
hormone replacement therapy , and history of tobacco use. Her
exercise tolerance is such that she develops shortness of breath
with walking one block or one flight of stairs. She reports having
to sit down at every other bench in the mall.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypercholesterolemia. Total cholesterol
266 down to 193. 2. Hypertension. 3.
Breast cancer status post left mastectomy seven years ago and
status post five years of Tamoxifen therapy. She has had no other
chemo or radiation treatment. 4. Depression. 5. Hypercalcemia ( no
alkalized syndrome ) 9/13 6. History of recurrent pneumonia. 7.
History of diverticulitis. 8. Glaucoma. 9. Non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus diagnosed one year ago , diet controlled. 10.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a history of pyelonephritis at age
three. 11. Mitral regurgitation. 12. Status post total abdominal
hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at age 40 , hormone
replacement therapy for five years which was then discontinued
secondary to her breast cancer. 13. Status post bilateral knee
replacement.
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. started three
weeks ago , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , Isordil 30 mg p.o. q.i.d. ,
hydralazine 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.day , Timoptic
0.25% one GTT OU b.i.d. , Serax 30 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia ,
and IV heparin at 1 , 300 units per hour.
ALLERGIES: Tagamet causes a rash and adhesive tape.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for a history of tobacco. She quit 17
years ago. She uses no alcohol and no IV drug
use. She lives with her husband in Lau and has six children.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her father died of stomach cancer. Mother , two
aunts , and sister have history of myocardial
infarction at ages greater than 60.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient has been following her weight since
her last discharge ( pulmonary edema ). She
reports a weight loss from 177 to 175 lb over the last couple of
days. She reports a 12 lb weight loss in the last month. She has
no complaints of dysuria or cough.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant female , resting
comfortably in bed. Her temperature was
98.5 , blood pressure 156/68 , pulse 78 , respirations 20 , and 95% on
two liters. There was no JVD. Carotids were 1+ without bruits , no
thyromegaly , and no lymphadenopathy. Lungs revealed right basilar
crackles. She was using accessory muscles for respirations. Heart
revealed regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2. There was a
II-III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the LSB. There was a III/VI
holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. There was
no S3 or S4. Her abdomen was slightly distended with no
hepatosplenomegaly. She was guaiac negative. She had 2+ femoral
pulses bilaterally without bruits and 2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
There was no ankle edema. Neurological examination was grossly
intact.
LABORATORY DATA: BUN was 59 , creatinine 3.9 , hematocrit 28.9 , and
MCV 82.3. Magnesium was 2.4. Chest x-ray from
outside hospital was consistent with pulmonary edema. EKG revealed
normal sinus rhythm at 81 , normal axis and intervals ( QT slightly
increased at 0.46 ) , LVH , LAE. There was T flattening in AVL.
There were no acute ST or T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient was much improved after
successful diuresis with improvement
of her pulmonary examination and no evidence of right sided
failure. She was saturating well on room air. Care was taken to
diurese slowly in order to present a prerenal insult. She remained
symptom free for the duration of her hospital course.
2. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: The patient denies ever having had any
chest pain , but had known anatomy with single vessel disease ( RCA ).
Her history is suggestive of possible silent ischemia consistent
with her diabetic status. Her anginal equivalent appears to be
shortness of breath. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization
on 6/2/97 with PTCA plus stent placement to her RCA with a good
result. She is on Ticlid for two weeks. Her blood pressure was
well controlled in her target range of 140-160 systolic blood
pressure on hydralazine , Lasix , and Lopressor. The day following
cardiac catheterization , her hematocrit and creatinine remained
stable at 30.9 and 3.7 , respectively. On 7/4/97 , her creatinine
increased to 4.2. This increase was thought to be due to a
combination of prerenal insult in addition to possible
dinephropathy. She was hydrated gently and her creatinine was
watched for the next two days , stabilizing in the 4.4 to 4.5 range.
3. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Etiology was unknown , possibly
secondary to diabetes mellitus or hypertensive nephropathy. She
has history of creatinine rises to high 3s and 4s during recent
hospitalizations. Hospital course is as described above. In
addition , Axid was changed to renal dosing ( q.day ) and the patient
was treated for a urinary tract infection. In reviewing the
hospital records , there is no evidence of previous work up for
renal artery stenosis. This patient with history and physical to
control blood pressures and flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
hypertension may benefit from further evaluation of possible renal
artery stenosis. This work up was deferred during this
hospitalization due to management of acute issues.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS: This was stable , diet controlled.
5. ANEMIA: The patient was worked up for her baseline low
hematocrit , found to have an iron deficiency anemia treated with
Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. Given her underlying renal failure ,
there may also be a renally driven component to her anemia and she
may benefit from Epogen as an outpatient.
The patient was discharged to home in stable condition to follow up
with Dr. Andre Smithe , her cardiologist , in two weeks , and her
primary care physician in one week based on previously scheduled
appointment.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.day , hydralazine 50 mg
p.o. q.i.d. , Isordil 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingual q. 5 minutes
times three p.r.n. chest pain , Timoptic 0.25% one drop OU b.i.d. ,
Axid 150 mg p.o. q.day , and Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. for two
weeks. Also , Niferex tablet 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to have her
CBC checked at two weeks and four weeks
given her Ticlid therapy.

secondary CHF p/w mild CHF flare. Home o2 requ 4-6L now increased to
7-8L. Here for some diruesis , goal hco3 should not exceed 35.
97% 6L , afebrile , bp150/80 L base decrease sounds with fine
rales 1+ pit edema.
**********************hospital course***************************
1. PULM: admitted with mild worsening of chronic hypoxia related to
restrictive lung disease , obesity hypoventilation and obstructive sleep
apnea. Her baseline home oxygen requirement in 5-6L by nasal cannula
along with nasal BiPAP at night 16/8. She had decompensated to 7-8Lnc
and was complaining of dyspnea , both of which resolved with iv lasix
and 2-3liters negative diuresis. She is chronically deconditioned and
obese and refused to go to a rehabilitation facility , even pulmonary
rehab.
2. CV: followed by Dr. Seling of cardiology; diuresed with iv lasix and
diamox with bicard between 30-35 during admission. No active ichemic i
ssue or arrhythmias noted during admission. Discharged on home
diuretic regimen of 80mg lasix po qd with instructed to take an extra
pill once if she feels like her ankles are swelling or she is
particularly short of breath and no phone her physician.
3. ID: CXR negative for infiltrate , no fever no cough and no evidence
of pneumonia. Ms. Boerner had her influenza vaccination this year
already.
4. Social: SW consulted , patient lives alone , has no support network
and is chronically noncompliant with medical and dietary
recommendations. Cardiac and pulmonary social work have both been
involved in her care in the past. PT consulted and recommended
pulmonary rehab , but patient refused. Her primary support is from an
internet friend who lives in Reve Ins and despite bargaining with staff
about which medicines to take and when to discharge her , she was well
enough to go on her scooter to visit ""friends"" in the hospital and get
high salt food from Connecticut She was discharged in stable condition with
oxygen back to her baseline levels of 96% on 5l nc and will follow up
with her pcp.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Continue to eat a low salt , low total fluid diet. Follow up with your
primary care physician , you cardiology and your hematologist as
necessary. There are no increased oxygen requirements at this time. If
you feel like your ankles are swelling or you are having trouble
breathing , please take one extra lasix pill and call your physician for
further instructions.

Discharge Date: 10/17/1997
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 76 year old woman with
asthma. Presenting problem was
shortness of breath. Problem list included anxiety , status post
cholecystectomy in 1988 , headaches , asthma , hypertension , vertigo ,
question of pneumonia in February 1996. Patient's cardiac risk
factors included a history of hypertension , she had no known
history of elevated cholesterol , she did not smoke , and had no
history of diabetes or family history of cardiac disease. She had
no prior myocardial infarction and no history of angina. The
patient did have a history of asthma with no prior hospitalizations
or steroid tapers. She did take p.o. Proventil at night and there
were no pulmonary function tests available on record. Two days
prior to admission , the patient noted sudden onset of inability to
sleep secondary to shortness of breath when lying down. The
patient tried her inhaler without relief of symptoms. She also
noted an intermittent nonproductive cough. The patient denied
fevers or chills. She reported that her symptoms did not improve
during the day and the night prior to admission , the patient noted
shortness of breath on exertion. She denied chest pain or chest
pressure. She had no diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting , or light
headedness. The patient presented to Bellmarle Medical Center
Emergency Department for persistent inability to sleep. On
evaluation in the Emergency Room , her blood pressure was 136/75
with a pulse of 124 , respiratory rate of 32 , and saturations of 94%
on room air. She was given nebulizers times three then 20 mg of
intravenous Lasix. She put out 600 cc of urine to that Lasix. The
Emergency Department then attempted to give her Verapamil 5 mg
times three to decrease her heart rate which was not effective.
The patient had no prior history of cardiac event. Her last
exercise test was in 1993. She went three minutes and five seconds
on the treadmill and stopped secondary to shortness of breath. Her
maximum heart rate was 130 with a maximum blood pressure of 190/80.
She had a baseline left bundle-branch block and therefore , her EKG
were not interpretable.
ALLERGIES: Patient had no known drug allergies.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Meclizine 25 mg t.i.d. , Proventil tablet 4 mg
p.o. q.h.s. , oxazepam 10 mg p.o. q.8h. ,
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d. , and Flexeril 10 mg p.o. q.8h.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Habits included that patient did not drink alcohol
and she did not smoke cigarettes. Patient lived
at home with her family who were very involved with her care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was an elderly Hispanic woman in no
acute distress. Vital signs included a
temperature of 98.2 , blood pressure 108/59 , pulse 101 , and
respiratory rates of 30 with saturations of 92% on three liters.
HEENT: Examination revealed a jugular venous pressure at 6 cm.
CHEST: Showed bilateral rales two thirds of the way up without
wheezes and no focal findings or egophony. CARDIAC: Examination
showed a regular rate and rhythm , tachycardic with a normal S1 and
S2 , no murmurs , and no S3 or S4. ABDOMEN: Showed a well healed
surgical scar , breath sounds present , no hepatosplenomegaly , and no
hepatojugular reflux. EXTREMITIES: Without edema , clubbing , or
cyanosis and she had 2+ symmetrical distal pulses. NEUROLOGICAL:
Examination was within normal limits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: SMA 7 was within normal limits with a BUN
of 15 and a creatinine of 1.0 , CBC showed
a white count of 9.45 , hematocrit of 36.5 , and platelets of 338.
CK was 110 and troponin was 0.0. Chest x-ray showed increased
heart size with bilateral increased interstitial markings
consistent with pulmonary edema and positive pulmonary vascular
redistribution. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 106 beats per
minute with normal intervals , an axis of negative 16 , a left
bundle-branch block , and no significant changes since 5/6/97.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for new onset congestive
heart failure. She was ruled out for myocardial
infarction. On the second day of hospitalization , she underwent an
exercise tolerance test MIBI on which she went four minutes and
eleven seconds on a modified Bruce protocol. She stopped secondary
to fatigue. She denied chest pain , there were no EKG changes , and
she had several bursts of nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia
with exercise. Nuclear images revealed mild fixed reduced uptake
in the inferior wall consistent with a small injury but no evidence
of ongoing ischemia. An echocardiogram was also performed that
revealed a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesis and an
ejection fraction of 15% to 20%. She had mild mitral calcification
with mild regurgitation , trace tricuspid regurgitation , and a
normal right ventricular size and function. It was determined that
the patient would benefit from afterload reduction and inatropy
given her poor ejection fraction. She was started on Captopril ,
Digoxin , and Isordil in addition to the Lasix she had received upon
presentation for her congestive heart failure. The patient
tolerated these medications well and maintained a systolic blood
pressure of approximately 100 without symptoms of orthostasis.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Proventil tablets 4 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Flexeril 10 mg p.o. q.8h. , Digoxin 0.0625 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 80 mg
p.o. q.d. , Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , meclizine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets taking one sublingually q.5 minutes
times three p.r.n. chest pain , Serax 10 mg p.o. q.8h. , K-Dur 20 mEq
p.o. q.d. , and Lisinopril 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with her primary care
physician , Dr. Rheaves , at Sharp Statepark Rehab in
Ston Dr. Jankoff will adjust her medications as
necessary and will arrange for an out-patient Holter monitor to
follow-up with nonsustained run of supraventricular tachycardia
during her exercise stress test.

OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Chest x-ray performed on 1/1/2006
by Freeman Ziesman showing mild pulmonary edema. Echocardiogram
performed on 1/1/2006 by Gavin Heltsley showing no significant
change from previous done 8/10/2003. Ejection fraction of 25% ,
left atrium 5 cm mildly enlarged , global hypokinesia , no obvious
thrombi , PA SBP 57 mmHg. EEG performed on 5/25/2006 by Pat Byford was consistent with mild encephalopathy of toxic ,
metabolic , traumatic , or other origins. No definitive , focal , or
epileptiform features. Previous EEG done on 9/17/2006 revealed
similar findings. Head CT on 5/25/2006 by Lanny Chiarito showed
prominent ventricles and sulci that appear appropriate for the
patient's age. No acute intracranial process.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted with an elevated
BNP and chest x-ray consistent with CHF flare , likely secondary
to UTI. On arrival to the floor , the patient was hemodynamically
stable and asymptomatic. EKG and one set of cardiac enzymes were
negative for cardiac ischemia and his home cardiac medications
were restarted. On examination , the patient had elevated JVP and
edema , suggesting that he was volume overloaded. The patient
responded to diuresis with torsemide 5 mg IV and metolazone 2.5
mg by mouth. He was switched to his home dose of torsemide 30 mg
p.o. and was euvolemic on discharge. Echocardiogram was
performed on 5/25/2006 to rule out structure etiologies for CHF
flare. Results showed no significant change from previous echo
done on 6/27/2006. The patient was on telemetry during the
hospital course and was noted to have atrial fibrillation with
premature ventricular contractions. He remained asymptomatic and
hemodynamically stable throughout the hospital course.
2. ID: UTI contributing to his CHF flare and MS changes.
Urinalysis was positive and the outside hospital reported
Gram-negative rods. The patient was continued on a 10-day course
of p.o. Levaquin. TP-IgG was negative.
3. Pulmonary: Chest x-ray on admission was consistent with mild
interstitial pulmonary edema. The patient remained asymptomatic
with no oxygen requirement. The patient responded well to
diuretic therapy for CHF flare.
4. Neurology: The patient's altered mental status was thought
to be secondary to urinary tract infection without metabolic
causes. B12 , folate , TSH , and T4 were within normal limits.
TP-IgG was negative. Iron was slow with small hypochromia on
smear , suggesting mild iron deficiency. EEG was also performed
on 5/25/2006 as this patient displayed fluctuations in cognitive
function that could be related to seizure activity. EEG was
nondiagnostic for epileptiform features. The patient was started
on Keppra 500 mg twice a day. His mental status appeared to be at baseline at
time of discharge
5. Renal: Creatinine 1.4 , baseline creatinine was monitored
during diuresis. Creatinine trended down to 1.3 on discharge.
Gross hematuria was present upon arrival to floor secondary to
patient pulling on catheter in his altered mental state. Bladder
scan ruled out obstruction and the bladder was irrigated to
remove clots. As the patient's mental status improved , he no
longer pulled on the catheter and the hematuria resolved. He
continued to have some bleeding around the catheter secondary to
BPH and the trauma from manipulation of the catheter.
6. Wounds: The patient had a nonhealing ulcer on the left
Achilles , recently seen at Usccaialt Hospital by Dr.
Kampmann , Plastic Surgery. He saw the patient and recommended
Panafil spray for the wound and frequent dressing changes. The
patient will follow up with Dr. Ousley as an outpatient.
7. GI: Distended abdomen with question of ascites. LFTs
returned within normal limits , no indication for ultrasound.
8. Hematology: Hematuria as described above which resolved with
improved mental status. The patient's hematocrit remained stable
throughout the hospital course. The patient has a history of
elevated INR , resistant to p.o. and subcutaneous vitamin K.
Records from Eym Medical Center suggest that the patient has factor
VII deficiency. The patient had no episodes of uncontrollable
bleeding or symptoms suggesting anticoagulative state.
9. Endocrine: Continued the patient's home dose of Synthroid.
Diabetes type 2 covered Lantus 10 units and insulin aspart
sliding scale.
10: Fen: Potassium/magnesium scales. cardiac ,
low salt diet.
11. Prophylaxis: Proton pump inhibitor , Lovenox.

Discharge Date: 5/21/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
OTHER PROBLEMS: 1. Poorly controlled hypertension.
2. Diabetes.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Fjeseth is a 62-year-old woman with
cardiac risk factors of hypertension ,
diabetes , a positive family history , and coronary disease
documented by a prior myocardial infarction who presented with
increased leg swelling , a 21 lb weight gain over the last three
months and who was seen in Clinic on February , 1996 , by Dr.
Glod , and was admitted for management. She had a myocardial
infarction in 1981 and , in September 1995 , she had a three vessel CABG
which included a LIMA graft to the LAD and two saphenous vein
grafts to the OM and to the PDA. In April 1995 , her postoperative
course had been complicated by loculated left pleural effusion
which required bronchoscopy and a left thoracentesis , as well as a
thorascopic lysis of pleural adhesions , some decortication and
drainage of effusions. At this time , she had also been dyspneic on
exertion along with shortness of breath at rest. On April , 1995 ,
she had an echo which showed an EF of 59% , a mildly dilated left
ventricle , abnormal septal motion secondary to left bundle branch
block , and minimal mitral regurgitation , and mild mitral
calcification above the normal right ventricular size and function.
A Bovie study was also performed and was negative. She also
presented with some biventricular failure and diuresis was
attempted , as well as alkaloid reduction. Over the past two
months , she had increased lower extremity edema , and she gained
approximately 21 lb since February , 1995. She has been quite
active and not limited. However , the edema has been her most
limiting factor. Three nights prior to admission , she had dyspnea
on exertion and some proximal maximal dyspnea , but she had no chest
pain and compression boots were attempted to try to alleviate some
of the edema. She had no orthopnea. She claims to have no dietary
indiscretions , no fevers , no sweats , no chills , no coughs , no chest
pain , no abdominal pain , and no bright red blood per rectum , but
she was more fatigued. On February , 1996 , she was seen in Clinic
by Dr. Denet and was seen to have increased leg edema and
increased dyspnea on exertion with climbing stairs. An echo was
performed and showed decreased left ventricular function within an
EF of about 40% , decreased down from an EF of 59% documented in
April 1995. Her CKs were flat an troponin I level later documented
0.4 , which was negative. Echo report also showed some inferior
posterior hypokinesis , as well as significant tricuspid
insufficiency at 3.2 meters per second , which suggested PA
pressures of about 41 mmHg. The patient was subsequently admitted
for management of her congestive heart failure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , status post
myocardial infarction in 1981 , hypertension
with systolics in the 200s , which has been difficult to control ,
diabetes for which she has been on insulin. She has a history of
an amaurosis fugax in September 1995 and was started on Coumadin in January
1995. She has a history of the loculated pleural effusions and a
history of TIA while being on Coumadin. She also has a history of
kidney stones.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: CABG times three in 1995 , right CEA in
1993 , and right mastoid surgery.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin and Ceclor which cause a rash.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5

FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for mother who had a myocardial
infarction at age 40 and 60. Father died of a
myocardial infarction at age 40.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a rather obese woman ,
totally edematous , who was slightly short of
breath while talking. Her vitals were 97.3 , 64 , blood pressure
211/100 , respiration rate 20 , and oxygen saturation of 96% on room
air. Her neck examination was significant for a jugular venous
pulse that went up to the angle of her jaw at 30 degrees. Her
carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally showing no bruits , but there was
a right CEA scar. Her chest examination was significant for few
crackles at bilateral bases. Cardiac examination showed a normal
S1 , S2 , but with a faint S3. Abdominal examination had a positive
fluid wave , positive bowel signs , and she was tender in right upper
quadrant. Extremities showed 3+ pitting edema to knees
bilaterally. DP pulse was 1+ bilaterally and femoral pulses were
unable to be palpated. Her weight , at the time of admission , was
233 lb.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory values were unremarkable at the time
of admission. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm of
64 , left bundle branch block , and there was no change essentially
since September 1995. Chest x-ray , on admission , showed increased
interstitial markings bilaterally with perhaps a slight pleural
effusion. There was also some left lower lobe scarring and there
was an elevated left hemidiaphragm , which was consistent with
increased initial pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix for the
first three hospital days , during which she lost
approximately 17 lb. She was then switched to p.o. Lasix on
hospital day four , and continued to diurese. She was placed on
strict fluid and diet restrictions throughout her stay. Her blood
pressure was controlled with a diuretic , as well as with a beta-1
blocker and ACE inhibitor and a small amount of nitrate. Her
calcium blocker was discontinued while we were trying to diurese
her. Her blood sugars ran low with her normal 35 units of NPH
dose , so the dose was held for a couple days and she was controlled
an CZI sliding scale and was resumed on 20 units of NPH. By
hospital day five , the patient was stable on the staple regimen.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , NPH 20 units subcutaneous
q.a.m. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.6h. ,
nitroglycerin NTG 1/150 sublingual q.5 minutes times three p.r.n.
chest pain , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , KCl slow release 32 mEq p.o. b.i.d. ,
ofloxacin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. times three days.
COMPLICATIONS: The patient had irritation of her bladder from her
Foley catheter and produced some bloody urine and
then upon discontinuing the Foley catheter had some burning of her
urine for which a urinalysis was performed. She was placed on
ofloxacin for three days.
DISPOSITION: The patient was stable upon discharge.
FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow up with Dr. Mancha on January ,
1996 at 12:30 p.m. during a scheduled appointment. She
is also to follow up with Kelley Tallie , her nurse at Ver Hospital to
follow up on her blood sugar control. The patient will also have a
VNA sent to see her three times a week for vital signs check ,
weight medical , pharmaceutical compliance , and her weights will be
called in to Dr. Heglar She should also improve upon her
physical therapy and increase her abilities for ambulation.

p.o. q.day , Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco or alcohol use reported.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98 , blood pressure 128/70 ,
pulse 75. Obese middle aged female in no
acute distress. HEENT was atraumatic , normocephalic. Neck was
supple with no bruits. Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam showed distant heart sounds ,
irregularly irregular. Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended ,
morbid obesity. Normal active bowel sounds. Extremities showed a
healing right shin superficial wound , 1+ edema bilaterally.
Neurologic exam showed mental status , orientation , attention and
language intact. Speech was low , but not clearly hoarse. Cranial
nerves right pupil irregular but reacts 2.5 to 2. Left pupil
irregular status post iridectomy. Visual fields intact. Right eye
slightly adducted at rest without diplopia. Mild decreased
abduction and adduction on the right without diplopia , even on
extreme gaze. No nystagmus. Unable to converge fully with the
right eye. No facial droop. Cranial nerves otherwise intact. Gag
present. Able to swallow without difficulty. Motor showed normal
tone and power to confrontation , symmetric bulk , ? slight slowing.
No clear pronator drift. Tendon reflexes trace brachialis , 2+
biceps , no triceps , trace knee reflexes , no ankle jerks. Equivocal
toes bilaterally. Sensation is notable for decreased vibration
sense , left greater than right at the toes , intact position sense
symmetric. Symmetric exam to temperature and light touch. ?
cerebellar exam with mild dysmetria on finger to nose on the left ,
Romberg stable with slight swaying to the left. Gait slow with
small steps , but fairly steady.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Labs showed sodium 143 , potassium 4.6 ,
chloride 100 , bicarb 29 , BUN 19 ,
creatinine 1.1 , glucose 67 , white blood cell count 8 , hematocrit
36 , platelets 222 , PT 17 , INR 2.3 , PTT 32. EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with no acute changes noted. Chest x-ray showed mild
cardiomegaly , no congestive heart failure or infiltrate. Head CT
showed movement artifact with no obvious CVA , ? hypodensity in the
right upper pons but likely artifact.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with symptoms of
vertical diplopia and unsteadiness/imbalance ,
falling to the left , with improvement overnight. Patient still had
an abduction defect with her right eye on the morning after
admission and mild leftward gait unsteadiness , but her vertical
diplopia had resolved. The patient was continued to be monitored.
Her blood pressure was followed. Patient was kept on Coumadin.
Patient was scheduled for an open air MRI , given her significant
size. Patient was scheduled for an open MRI at the MRI in
Well Deh Ny On 3 of August , patient underwent MRI with particular
interest in visualization of the posterior fossa. No acute infarct
or hemorrhage was noted on MRI MRA. The patient was continued on
her Coumadin. Coumadin had been increased from admission dose of
17 mg to 18 mg p.o. q.p.m. Initially , her INR went down slightly
on 3 of August to 1.7 , likely secondary to a missed dose earlier in the
week. On 17 of July , patient reported feeling back to her baseline of
one week ago. Patient denied any new symptoms. Patient denied
further imbalance or vertical diplopia. Patient was thought to
have had a likely small vessel cerebral infarct and , although no
stroke was demonstrated on MRI , involvement of patient's left side
suggested a cerebral lesion in the brain stem in order to explain
the diplopia. Patient probably had a very small vessel stroke/TIA.
Patient has known major risk factors for both small vessel and
large vessel and cardioembolic disease. Patient was discharged to
continue further risk factor modification in the outpatient clinic.
Patient is to continue her cardiac medical regimen. Patient will
continue with Coumadin for a goal INR of 2-3 for her chronic atrial
fibrillation. Patient was discharged on 5 of March She was
instructed to call SMER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL on Monday morning to schedule an
appointment with her primary care physician within the next 10
days. Patient is discharged in stable condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amitriptyline 50 mg p.o. q.day , Colace
100 mg p.o. q.day , Lasix 120 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.day , diltiazem CD 180 mg p.o. q.day ,

Discharge Date: 2/3/1996
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND
MIXED MITRAL VALVE DISEASE
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Reda is an 87 year-old
woman with a history of coronary
artery disease , mitral regurgitation and multiple sclerosis. She
has been complaining of chest pain and pressure on exertion as well
as dyspnea on exertion associated with limitation of activity and
increasing sublingual nitroglycerin use for the six to seven months
prior to admission. Of note , the patient developed atrial
fibrillation , atrial flutter back in October , 1995. An
echocardiogram at that time demonstrated an ejection fraction of
40% , inferior hypokinesis , moderate mitral regurgitation , and a
left atrial size of 6.1 centimeters. The patient required
hospitalization in October , 1996 , for congestive heart failure. She
returned to the hospital in February , 1996 , with complaints of chest
pain at rest and shortness of breath. She was ruled out for
myocardial infarction at Tol Hospital and transferred to
Ana Vinerl Hospital , where she refused cardiac
catheterization. Echocardiogram at that time demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 45% , inferior , posterior and anterior septal
hypokinesis , mild to moderate mitral stenosis and moderate mitral
regurgitation. Again , there was left atrial enlargement measured
at 6.1 centimeters. The patient returned home and was doing well
until February , 1996 , when she developed headache , chest pain and
shortness of breath. She again presented to Beth's Community Memorial Hospital where
she was found to be in acute pulmonary edema. She was stabilized
and transferred to Crithouse County Medical Center for further
management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
status post anterior myocardial infarction.
Mitral regurgitation. Mitral stenosis. Atrial fibrillation.
Hypertension. Hypothyroidism. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Peptic ulcer disease. Normocytic anemia. Polymyalgia rheumatica.
History of left humeral fracture. She is status post appendectomy ,
cholecystectomy , and laser therapy for retinal disease of the right
eye.
ALLERGIES: Erythromycin , which causes vomiting and hypertension ,
as well as to sulfa drugs which cause vomiting. She
has a possible allergy to penicillin as well.

SOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and retired. She has no smoking
or alcohol history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is in atrial fibrillation at a rate of
83. Her blood pressure is 100/60 and is 95%
on room air. HEENT: Significant for upper and lower dentures
without any oropharyngeal lesions. NECK: Supple with 2+ carotid
pulses and no bruits. LUNGS: Bibasilar crackles. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Irregularly irregular rate and rhythm. Normal S1/S2. III/VI
holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla. ABDOMEN:
Soft , nontender , obese. EXTREMITIES: Without cyanosis , clubbing
or edema. There are varicosities in bilateral lower extremities
with minimal varicosities over the thigh areas. There is bilateral
knee swelling. Pedal pulses are 1+ bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL:
Nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: BUN is 35 , creatinine 1.5. White blood cell count
8.3. Hematocrit 32. PT 11.9 , PTT 28.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Jeffganlanda Py Docweli Skiffle Community Hospital Cardiology Service , where she
was maximized medically. The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on January , 1996 , where she was noted to have
right coronary artery stenosis in the mid portion which was 50% and
distally had 80%. Finally , 90% with subtotal occlusion after the
posterior descending artery. The left anterior descending artery
had 40% stenosis after diagonal 1. Diagonal 1 itself had 90%
stenosis in the mid portion. The left circumflex had a 70%
stenosis at the mid portion and another 70% stenotic area at the
distal portion. Left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated
at 45%. Inferior hypokinesis was noted as was 3-4+ mitral
regurgitation. Right atrial pressures were 6 , right ventricle was
52/10 , pulmonary artery 52/22 , with mean of 33 , pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure was 27 and left ventricle was 160/16. The patient
was evaluated by the Cardiac Surgical Service for coronary artery
bypass grafting and replacement of her mitral valve. On March , 1996 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four with saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal one , saphenous vein graft to left anterior
descending artery , diagonal one and to left anterior descending
artery. She also had mitral valve replacement with 31 millimeter
Hancock. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred postoperatively to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit on
nitroglycerin , Dopamine drip. She was weaned to extubate without
difficulty. She was restarted on Captopril and digoxin as well as
Coumadin. The patient had minimal response to diuretics ,
associated with a rise in her creatinine to 1.9. The Captopril was
discontinued and the creatinine returned again to 1.3. Although
the chest x-ray demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions , the
patient did not require aggressive diuresis initially as she had
excellent oxygenation on room air. Of note the patient was not
restarted on Lopressor as her blood pressures remained in the
90-100 range. The patient was , however , started on her prednisone
at 5 milligrams p.o. q.d. as well as on her Synthroid. Chest tubes
and invasive monitoring were discontinued early in the patient's
hospital course and she was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number four. The patient was followed by
physical therapy and occupational therapy for progression of her
mobility. She was determined to benefit from intensive
rehabilitation at a facility.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was ambulating with
assistance. She was tolerating a regular
diet. She was seen to be in atrial fibrillation but ventricular
response was well controlled in the 60s to 70s. Of note , her
electrocardiogram demonstrated persistent right bundle branch block
as well as a left anterior fascicular block. Although the patient
had been receiving more than her normal doses of Coumadin , her INR
had not reached the therapeutic range. She was , however ,
therapeutic on heparin.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to a facility for
intensive conditioning and rehabilitation. There she
will continue to receive her heparin until she is therapeutic on
her Coumadin. Coumadin dosing will be handled by primary care
doctor , Dr. Corey Updegraff , or a physician at the rehabilitation
center. Dr. Turks 's number is 250-940-9571. The goal INR is 2
to 2.5. The patient will also require follow-up chest x-rays as
prior to discharge , her chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural
effusions which were small and were not compromising her
respiration at all.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol #3 one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h.
p.r.n. pain; digoxin 0.125 milligrams p.o.
q.d.; Colace 100 milligrams p.o. t.i.d. while taking Tylenol #3;
Lasix 80 milligrams p.o. q.d. to be continued initially but may be
discontinued at the discretion of the primary care or cardiology
physicians , pending the resolution of the pleural effusions and her
respiratory status; Synthroid 150 micrograms p.o. q.d. The patient
will require thyroid function tests in four weeks. Multivitamin
one tablet p.o. q.d.; Coumadin , dose to be determined by the
patient's INR , again the goal is 2 to 2.5. The patient received 4
milligrams on September , and 3 milligrams on September , and her
INR on September is 1.3. Axid 150 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.; K-Dur
10 mEq p.o. q.d. , potassium will also need to be monitored while
she is on the Lasix; intravenous heparin 800 units per hour with a
PTT goal of 50-60. The patient's PTT today on this dosing is 54.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient should follow-up with Dr. Kale in four to
six weeks , with Dr. Nicklas in two weeks , and with Dr.
Etheredge in one to two weeks.

ATTENDING: SID GIL KIJOWSKI MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , the patient is a
76-year-old woman with coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft in 1992 who was recently admitted
with non ST elevation MI/congestive heart failure at which time
catheterization revealed an increased wedge with decreased
patency in both venous grafts and a patent LIMA graft with
collaterals. The patient has an extensive past medical history
of hypercholesterolemia , chronic renal insufficiency , insulin
dependent diabetes , coronary artery disease status post multiple
MI , CABG , hypertension , degenerative joint disease , CVA , gout ,
schizoaffective disorder , tardive dyskinesia and hypothyroidism.
At her baseline she has been staying at the Wrangcon Ronhomar Memorial Hospital and on
admission was complaining of chest pressure since waking , similar
to the pressure she felt during a prior admission. She had a
certain amount of shortness of breath , some nausea , two episodes
of vomiting and her symptoms were not responsive to nitroglycerin
tablets at the Harpa Vensports Center The patient came to the Ter Health Emergency Department where she reported that her
chest pressure had resolved. She was treated with IV TNG. In
the Emergency Department she was also treated with Lopressor ,
aspirin , IV trinitroglycerin and was heparinized. The patient
then pulled out the lines. Her admission vitals were significant
for a blood pressure of 180/90. The patient had a heart rate of
86 , was afebrile and was breathing at 100% at 2 liters. She had
an elevated JVP , had clear sounding lungs , trace edema and at the
left upper sternal border and left lower sternal border a
systolic ejection murmur II-III/VI was heard with S1 and S2.
Admission labs were significant for an elevated creatinine of
2.0. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient had elevated
platelets from a baseline of 30 to 80 to 673 on admission , a
white count of 9.3 , hematocrit of 35. EKG was notable for a Q3
which had been seen on a prior EKG. T-wave inversions also seen
on a prior EKG. The patient had an echo on 7/4 which showed
concentric LVH with an EF of 30-35% , posterolateral and inferior
akinesis was also seen. A calcified aortic valve with trace AI
and mild MR was seen. On 10/19 , the patient had catheterization
which showed that her circulation was right dominant with an LAD
90% and 100% lesions , left circumflex with 100% lesion , RCA with
100% lesions. She had an SVG to PDA graft with 100% lesion , SVG
to circumflex graft with 85% lesion stented to 10% at that time.
She had a LIMA to LAD graft which was patent , and she had lots of
collaterals. The right heart cath was significant for a wedge of
39 and a PA of 75/34 and right atrial pressure of 14 and a
cardiac index of 1.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By system ,
1. Ischemia: The patient was initially treated with aspirin ,
beta blockers , statin , Plavix , Heparinized and was ruled out with
enzymes. On the first day of hospitalizations , the patient's
heparin was stopped , the patient's IV trinitroglycerin was
stopped as well. The patient was started on nadolol and that
dose was increased to 80 q.day which the patient tolerated well
and seemed to control the patient's blood pressure and heart rate
reasonably well. The patient's attending felt that the patient
was a poor candidate for catheterization and other interventions
and would not benefit significantly from it. The symptoms the
patient was having was similar she was having during a prior
hospitalization which had ended just two days before this
admission. It was felt that her nausea , vomiting and chest
pressure were probably noncardiac in nature. The only change in
the patient's cardiac medications at the time of discharge is an
increase in nadolol to 80 mg q.day.
Rhythm: The patient's rhythm was monitored on telemetry for most
of her stay during this hospitalization. Significant events were
not observed.
Pump: The patient was continued at her regular dose of
outpatient medications which seemed to be effective. The patient
had multiple complaints of chest pain/pressure during her
hospitalization which resulted in periodic examinations and EKGs.
All of these workups were negative.
2. GI: On 10/26 it was noted that the patient had an increased
white count of 16 , 000. Also on exam on that day it was noted
that the patient had marked right upper quadrant abdominal
tenderness and fullness. She was not tender anywhere else in her
abdomen. Abdominal exam was also significant for a central mass
representing an umbilical hernia. At that time , General Surgery
consult was called. Lipase and amylase were sent off. They were
negative. Liver function tests were also in the normal range at
that time. Surgery felt that the patient was a poor surgical
candidate given her comorbidities at that time but did recommend
a cholecystectomy in the future. They recommended initial
antibiotic course of amp , Levo and Flagyl which she was started
on. They also recommended making the patient NPO treated her
with Pepcid and giving her adequate IV hydration. The major
intervention they suggested was a cholecystectomy tube by
Interventional Radiology which was placed on the night of
3/16/04. On 9/24 , the patient's white count was down to 10 with
a Tmax of 100 , and at the time of discharge the patient had a
white count in the normal range around 7 and was also afebrile.
Surgery followed the patient during her stay in the hospital as
did Interventional Radiology. Bile was sent out for culture
which showed yeast as well as a gram stain which showed gram
positive cocci. The patient's antibiotics were switched to
Vancomycin , Levo and Flagyl. Initially the Vancomycin and Flagyl
were given IV and the Levo was given p.o. One day prior to
discharge , the patient's Flagyl was switched to p.o. and on the
day of discharge the Vancomycin was stopped after the patient had
received seven days of Vancomycin. The patient will be
discharged on Flagyl p.o. and Levo p.o. The patient was also
started no Fluconazole 100 to treat the yeast that was noted in
her bile cultures. The IR drain will need to be in the patient's
gallbladder for a minimum of six weeks or until the patient has
her elective cholecystectomy which will be scheduled at a later
date.
3. ID: The patient is colonized with MRSA and appropriate
precautions were taken and the patient was also noted to have an
infection in her gallbladder and was treated for it as such.
4. Pain: The patient was treated for abdominal pain during her
stay in the hospital with Demerol and also with Morphine.
5. Psychiatry: The patient was seen by Psychiatry on admission
to help manage her agitation and delirium. They did a
preliminary assessment of the patient. The patient did show
certain signs of agitation and multiple code grays had to be
called on the patient for difficult behavior , though the patient
was never in danger of truly hurting herself or others.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Cardiac chest pain.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Cholecystitis now resolved.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: ASA 325 , Colace 100 b.i.d. , Lasix 80
b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale , Levoxyl 175 , nadolol 80 , Lipitor
80 q.h.s. , Lantis 18 units , Diovan 80 , levofloxacin 500 every 24
hours to complete a 14 day course , Fluconazole 100 to complete a
14 day course , Flagyl 500 t.i.d. to complete a 14 day course ,
Plavix 75 , famotidine 20 b.i.d. , iron 325 q.day.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: DYSPNEA ON EXERTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Cabaniss is a 70-year-old woman with
a history of yellow nail syndrome ,
hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes ,
who has had multiple admissions since October 2001. The first was
an admission to an outside hospital from 5/25/01 - 11/20/01.
At that time , she had increased shortness of breath , and was
diagnosed with bilateral pleural effusions and a pericardial
effusion. She had a pericardial window and 600 cc were drained
from her pericardium , as well as pleural effusions drained. She
was discharged at that time with a diagnosis of congestive heart
failure , secondary to cor pulmonale. The second admission was
from 8/28/01 - 8/10/01 at the Aen Medical Center . At that time , she had
increased lower extremity edema. She was diuresed during that
admission , and again her pleural effusions were tapped. An
echocardiogram at that time revealed mild LVH , an ejection fraction
of 55-60% , no wall motion abnormalities and a moderate-large
pericardial effusion with fibrinous strands.
A catheterization of her left and right heart revealed a right
atrial pressure of 5 , an RV pressure of 45/11 , PA pressures of
38/18 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , LV pressure
was 127/14. There was no constrictive pericardial disease or
restrictive cardiomyopathy. She also had no malignant cells in her
pleural effusion , which was exudated. ANCA , ANA , SPEP were
negative. She also had a renal ultrasound that was without mass or
hydronephrosis , 24 hour urine collection with decreased protein.
The third admission was at Beysa Dward Hospital from 11/15/01 - 1/16/01 , for
increasing shortness of breath and increasing lower extremity
edema. At that time she was diuresed , found to be iron deficient.
She had bilateral thoracentesis , which revealed exudative
effusions. PFTs revealed a FEV1 of .9 , 40% of predicted , an FVC of
1.26 , 43% of predicted , an FEV1/FVC ratio of 93% , a TLC of 2.07 ,
40% of predicted , and a DLCO of 8.42 , also 40% of predicted. She
was ruled out for TB with serial ASBs during this admission.
She was also diagnosed with yellow nail syndrome at that time ,
consisting of the clinical syndrome of recurrent pleural effusions ,
lymphedema and yellow fingernails. She was started on high dose
Vitamin E , and evaluated by CT surgery for a possible pleurodesis.
However , she was sent home at that time with an increased dose of
diuretics.
Since her discharge in July , she has been aggressively diuresed ,
but the diuretics were stopped secondary to hyperkalemia. In September
2001 , she was found to have a 10 pound weight gain and was
restarted on Lasix. Over the week prior to admission , she has had
increasing dyspnea on exertion. She has baseline shortness of
breath and orthopnea , but her orthopnea has also worsened. Her
weight at discharge in July was 208 , and on admission she
currently weighs 238 , and was 231 pounds a month prior to
admission. She denies wheezing , but does have a chronic cough with
white sputum. She has had some substernal chest pain that is sharp
with dyspnea on exertion , which lasts for awhile without radiation.
She also has increasing lower extremity edema. In the emergency
department , she was found to be afebrile , heart rate 103 ,
respiratory rate 24 , blood pressure 95/41 and satting 91% on 2
liters. She was given Albuterol and Atrovent nebs without
improvement and Lasix 160 mg IV with a 600 cc diuresis.

SUMMARY: This is a 70-year-old woman with history of hypertension ,
diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , home 02
requirement and yellow nail syndrome. She was admitted with
increasing dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea and a weight gain over
the past week prior to admission. She has most likely had a
failure of home diuretics , and needed to have her effusions tapped
along with some definitive therapy for her yellow nail syndrome in
terms of recurrent pleural effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Pulmonary. We initially diuresed Ms. Jowell
with IV Lasix , along with Diuril. She had brisk
diuresis overnight , but was still short of breath the next day. On
hospital day #2 , we did a thoracentesis on her right side and were
able to remove 1.5 liters of clear , yellowish fluid. The fluid was
sent for cytology , as well as chemistries and returned as an
exudative effusion with predominant lymphocytes. The cytology was
negative for any malignant cells. The pulmonary team was
consulted , who decided that she would benefit from a pleurodesis to
prevent effusions from recurring. We consulted thoracic surgery ,
who requested a CT scan after a thoracentesis to assess her lungs
for evidence of malignancy.
CT scan was done on 9/19/01 , but due to atelectasis and having to
do the study without IV contrast , there were areas in her right and
left lungs that appeared nodular or opacified and could have been
malignancies. CT surgery also requested cardiac clearance before
any definitive surgical therapy was done due to new onset SVT. We obtained a
stress MIBI. On 9/4/01 , she was taken to the operating room for surgery
of the right chest. At that time , Dr. Women , the cardiothoracic
surgeon took biopsies of her pleura , which were reportedly
thickened and yellow. She also took a wedge biopsy of the right
lower lobe. Those biopsies have returned , and revealed mild
nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis with chronic bronchiolitis.
The diaphragm was also biopsied , and was determined to be lymphoid
tissue in a fibrous tissue fragment. She had a chest tube placed
at the time of operation and tolerated that well. However , after that
procedure , she was deemed unstable by the PACU team and was
admitted to MICU overnight. She extubated without problems and
remained on a few liters of oxygen overnight , with oxygen
saturations in the 90%. She was readmitted to the medicine team
on the following day , 8/28/01. Overall , she tolerated that
procedure well. Her chest tube that was placed on the right side
did not drain much fluid over the next few days. However , the
pleural effusion on the left side , did increase in size and we did
a thoracentesis on 8/28/01. We removed 1 liter of turbid ,
yellowish brown fluid. The chemistries revealed a lymphocyte and
macrophage predominance and the cytology is still pending at this
time. As her chest tube was not draining much fluid , the thoracic
surgery team decided to pleurodese her with doxycycline , which has
shown to be effective in yellow nail syndrome in patient's 70% of
the time. The pleurodesis was on 3/29/01. She tolerated this
procedure well , and had little chest tube drainage over the next 48
hours. The chest tube was pulled on 6/2/01.
Mrs. Musson 's shortness of breath was much improved after the
initial thoracentesis on the right , and she is currently on her
home oxygen requirement of 2 liters , satting in the mid-90%. The
plan is for her to see Dr. Colasante in 2 weeks and also have a
follow-up chest x-ray. At that time , Dr. Ostermann will determine if
there is fluid reaccumulating on the right after the pleurodesis.
She can then have a repeat pleurodesis on the right , or an initial
pleurodesis on the left.
2. Cardiovascular. Mrs. Blan was tachycardic on admission , and
continued to be tachycardic throughout the admission. She was
initially diuresed with IV Lasix and Diuril , and was probably over
diuresed , a total of 2-3 liters over a number of hours overnight.
On hospital day #2 , she was found to be tachycardic with rates in
the 140s-150s and atrial fibrillation. She converted back to
normal sinus rhythm with 3 doses of IV calcium channel blockers and
a Diltiazem drip. She was then maintained on Diltiazem SR 60 mg PO
b.i.d. throughout the admission and remained in normal sinus
rhythm. However , her tachycardia was noted to be multifocal HL
tachycardia during her MICU admission. At the time of admission ,
we did a pulsus which was only 8 mmhg. She had a bedside
echocardiogram to rule out a pericardial effusion , which revealed a
trace pericardial effusion. She also had a dobutamine MIBI for
cardiac clearance for the cardiothoracic surgical procedure. Her
heart rate increased from 107-129 , and the blood pressure decreased
from 115/70 - 110/70 at peak stress. The clinical response to
dobutamine was non-ischemic , the blood pressure response was
normal , and the EKG response to dobutamine was non-ischemic. There
were no definite regional perfusion defects seen on the stress or
rest images. However , only planer images could be obtained , due to
difficulty with positioning of the patient's left arm. Her results
were determined to be normal , and suggestive of no evidence of
hemodynamically secondary CAD , although the study was technically
limited.
In terms of her diuresis , Ms. Duensing was kept on IV Lasix for only
the first few days of her admission , and then was switched to PO
diuretics. Initially at a dose of 200 mg PO b.i.d. , and then
decreased to 120 mg PO b.i.d. Her lower extremity edema decreased
significantly , along with her pleural effusions.
3. Renal. Ms. Handy 's baseline creatinine is 1.7 , her creatinine
throughout her admission varied between 1.6-1.9. We caused a mild
contraction alkalosis with diuretics , but were able to replete her
electrolytes as needed. She will follow with Dr. Svinth for her
renal insufficiency as an outpatient.
4. Endocrine. Ms. Reppell has type II diabetes and was on glyburide
5 mg q. d. as an outpatient. She continued that therapy as an
inpatient , and her finger sticks were in good control during this
admission.
5. Rheumatology. Ms. Chad has a history of gout , and we were
concerned about precipitating a gout attack with the aggressive
diuresis. We continued her colchicine and decreased her
allopurinol to 200 mg PO q. d. We also continued her Vitamin E
therapy for the yellow nail syndrome.
6. Hematology. She has chronic anemia , and we continued her iron
and Procrit treatment during the admission.
DISPOSITION: Ms. Souza will be discharged to home with VNA
services to administer her twice weekly Procrit doses , and physical
therapy to aid her in regain her strength and range of motion in
her joints infected with gout. She has been instructed to make
follow-up appointments with Dr. Amicone in a few weeks , and to have
a chest x-ray on the day that she sees Dr. Burchell She should also
follow-up with Dr. Donkin in the renal clinic.

ATTENDING: LAVERN CUSTA MD , PHD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease status post
inferior myocardial infarction.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Inferior myocardial infarction.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: Rheumatoid arthritis , myocardial infarction ,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , coronary artery disease
status post carotid endarterectomy , status post cerebrovascular
accident , gastroesophageal reflux disease , diabetes mellitus ,
cerebral artery aneurysm , and depression.
The patient is a 77-year-old female with coronary artery disease
who presented to an outside hospital with chest pain that she
thought was GERD but became concerned when it started radiating
down her left arm. At the outside hospital , she was noted to be
febrile with temperature 39.8 and noted on EKG to have ST
elevations in the inferior leads. The patient was med-flighted
to Hasey Health Care for an emergent cath. The patient had 70%
LAD lesion , 50% proximal RCA , and 90% mid RCA lesion that was
stented to 0% , and a 60% PDA lesion , and LVEDP of 33 on initial
cath. Started on Integrilin post cath and transferred to CCU.
The patient did well in the CCU and was transferred out on the
next day. Previous to admission , the patient resided in a
assisted living facility and was fairly active but has had
increasing dyspnea on exertion , decreasing exercise tolerance
over the past six months.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature was 98.8 , heart
rate was in the 70s , BP was 120s/60s , respirations was 22 ,
saturation was 90% on 2 liters nasal cannula. Generally , she is
an obese female in mild distress. Some cough. Her HEENT exam
showed a clear oropharynx. No erythema or injection. Skin had
no rashes or other lesions. Neck was supple with full range of
motion. JVP was approximately 2 with 2+ carotid pulses without
bruits. No thyromegaly or nodules. Chest was noted to have
diffuse wheezing with bilateral bibasilar crackles. Questionable
right-sided consolidation , PMI nondisplaced with a regular rate
and rhythm with S4 , S1 with physiologically split S2. No
significant murmurs or rubs. Abdomen was nondistended and
nontender. Positive bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. Her
extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 2+ femoral ,
DP , and PT pulses. Neurologically , she was alert and oriented
with normal mental status and nonfocal exam. Her chest x-ray
showed evidence of pulmonary edema with focal consolidation of
right upper lobe with chest consistent with pneumonia. Her EKG
on admission , was normal sinus rhythm in the 60s with normal axis
and inferior Q waves with T-wave inversions inferiorly and
laterally.
IMPRESSION: This is a 77-year-old female status post IMI with
concurrent COPD exacerbation secondary to probable right upper
lobe pneumonia.
HOSPIATL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient did very well status post
revascularization. She did have some persistent pain while in
the intensive care unit and this went away on transfer to the
floor. She was medically optimized and continued on aspirin and
Plavix , added a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor to the patient's
1B pump. The patient had compensated heart function on
discharge , euvolemic , but she did require intermittent Lasix.
She was discharged on Lasix to treat heart failure. Rhythm-wise ,
the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the course
of hospitalization.
2. Pulmonary: The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation
with a rapid prednisone taper , and her home nebulizers , and a
10-day course of levofloxacin. Incidentally , the patient also
admitted to having a TB exposure. We placed a TB and that was
nonreactive and had induced sputums that were negative x 3.
3. Renal: The patient had well preserved renal function
normalized at discharge.
4. FEN: The patient was tolerating oral diet well and was
indicated on her instructions that she should have low-calorie ,
low-fat , low-cholesterol diet particularly given her diabetes and
she should watch her sugar and was maintained on her own.
5. Psychiatry: The patient has a history of depression and
noted to be depressed throughout the course of hospitalization
with some suicidal ideations toward the end of her
hospitalization. For that reason , we requested that psychiatry
come and evaluate her. They did so deeming her safe to return to
her facility and adjusting her antidepressants. The patient was
discharged in stable condition.
Procedures included percutaneous coronary intervention with
stenting to her right coronary artery x 2. Please see full
report for details.
Her discharge medications include aspirin 325 mg , atenolol 25 mg
p.o. q.d. , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Atrovent inhaler two to four puffs q.i.d. p.r.n. , lisinopril 2.5
mg p.o. q.d. , Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. insomnia or
anxiety , prednisone she was completing a taper with 40 mg x 2
days , 20 mg x 2 days , 10 mg x 2 days , and then off , trazodone 50
mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. sleep , Zocor 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Flovent 110
mcg b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Serevent one puff inhaled
b.i.d. , Nexium 20 mg p.o. q.d. , and Elmiron 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
The patient had followup set up with her primary care doctor ,
cardiology as well as her psychiatrist.

SERVICE: General Medical Service , Ma Ahendbrown
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSIS: HEMORRHAGIC CYSTITIS.
IDENTIFICATION: Mr. Ranweiler is a 69 year old gentleman with a
history of adult onset diabetes mellitus ,
peripheral vascular disease , chronic hemorrhagic cystitis who is
currently transfusion dependent , who was admitted with congestive
heart failure and elevated CK , MB in the setting of profound anemia
and presents for a blood transfusion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has a long , complex
urologic history which includes
prostate cancer which was treated with radiation approximately
twenty years ago. More recently , superficial bladder cancer which
was treated with partial resection. He developed hematuria
approximately April 1995. A workup revealed hemorrhagic cystitis
which was felt to be secondary to prior radiation treatments. He
has required approximately 1 unit of red cells per week for the
past three months to keep up with ongoing urologic blood loss.
The patient has no known cardiac history. His risk factors include
diabetes , hypertension , tobacco use , and male sex. No history of
hypercholesterolemia or family history. He describes 4-5 episodes
of chest tightness occurring over the past five years , the last
episode occurring approximately three months ago. He does note
progressive pedal edema over the past six weeks and over the past
two to three days has had increasing fatigue and dyspnea on
exertion. On the day prior to admission , routine VNA blood draw
revealed a hematocrit of 17. His primary care physician was
notified and the patient was instructed to report to Fiville Gadelp Medical Center on the day of admission for transfusion. Repeat
hematocrit on the day of admission was 18. He received two units
of packed red cells and chemotherapy infusion and shortly after
transfusion developed shortness of breath without chest pain.
Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure. His
initial CK was 770 with 70 MB fraction. The patient was
transferred to the Emergency Room for further evaluation where he
was treated with topical Nitro paste , 40 mg of IV Lasix , resulting
in 1500 cc of urine output. Aspirin and heparin were held
secondary to hemorrhagic cystitis. Beta blocker was also held
secondary to question of bronchospasm.
The patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for
further treatment.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. AODM. 2. Peripheral vascular disease.
3. Neuropathy. 4. Prostate cancer. 5.
Bladder cancer in 1995 and 1990. 6. Status post appendectomy. 7.
History of TIAs three to four years ago. Workup revealed 50%
bilateral carotid stenosis. 8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. 9. Hypertension.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes edema. Steroids cause cytosis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Cardizem CD
180 mg p.o. q.day , folate 1 mg p.o. q.day ,
iron sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.day , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of leukemia. Father had a CVA and
kidney problems. No known coronary artery
disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Two pack per day smoking , 1-2 drinks per day. The
patient is a retired teacher at a Tyfranxingcolnlu Sxingscond A He currently lives alone and is single.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a pleasant older gentleman in no
apparent distress. Temperature 98.6 , blood
pressure 110/62 , heart rate 98. Oxygen saturation of 97% on 2
liters. HEENT: Examination is benign , no JVD , JVP was at 7 cm ,
neck was supple. CHEST: Bibasilar crackles. CARDIAC: 2+
carotids , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. ABDOMEN: Two frontal scars , liver was palpable 2 cm
below the right costal margin. The abdomen was soft , non-tender ,
nondistended , normal bowel sounds , no masses. BACK: No CVA or
spinal tenderness. RECTAL: Guaiac negative in the Emergency Room.
EXTREMITIES: 1+ left greater than right pedal edema. Superficial
ulcers on bilateral soles. NEURO: Alert and oriented times three.
Nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 132 , potassium 4.7 , chloride
96 , bicarb 25 , BUN 7 , creatinine
0.9 , glucose 186 , CK of 776 , MB 70.5. LFTs were within normal
limits. Hematocrit was 28.3 , white count 10.4 , platelet count 283 ,
PT 13.5 , PTT 26.2 , normal differential.
Urinalysis grossly bloody , 10-20 white cells.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure with small bilateral
effusions , right greater than left , plus Kerley B-lines.
EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 90 , intervals 212/72/368 , and axis 7
degrees. No ischemic changes.
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: This is a 69 year old gentleman with multiple
cardiac risk factors , chronic anemia secondary
to severe hemorrhagic cystitis , no transfusion dependent , who was
admitted with congestive heart failure after blood transfusion and
positive CK , MB. No definitive EKG changes and no clear history of
angina but recent history of increased pedal edema. The patient
likely had recent myocardial infarction and congestive heart
failure in the setting of transfusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit
for further care. As mentioned above , heparin
and aspirin were held secondary to the risk of worsening
hemorrhagic cystitis. The patient received further blood
transfusions to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30. He remained
in the Cardiac Care Unit overnight. Serial CKs revealed an A set
of 776 ( MB 70.5 ) , B set 747 ( MB 54.7 ) , C set 564 ( MB 33.2 ). CTNI
was 25.1. EKG's were without evolution. The patient was therefore
ruled in for a non Q-wave myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram
was performed on 4/17/96 which showed normal LV function , mild LVH ,
no regional wall motion abnormalities but of a somewhat suboptimal
quality. The patient received a total of four units of red blood
cells with a subsequent rise in hematocrit from 17 to 30.1 by the
first hospital day and received initially 40 mg of IV Lasix in the
Emergency Room , followed by two doses of 20 mg with excellent urine
output.
The patient was transferred from the CCU to General Medical
Service , Scogard on his second hospital day , 9/23/96. His post MI
course was uncomplicated , notable only for two runs of
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia overnight on the first
hospital day. The patient had no recurrent angina and no recurrent
evidence of congestive heart failure.
He underwent a routine post MI submax ETT on 9/3/96. The patient
went 4 minutes and 4 seconds with a peak work load of 31 , peak
heart rate of 80 , and peak blood pressure of 160/80. He stopped
secondary to fatigue. He occasional PVC's but no chest pain and no
ST changes. The test was thought to show no evidence of ischemia
but had a low work load. It was thought appropriate to discharge
the patient to home for further medical management and further
urologic workup as an outpatient. The most important medical
intervention would be to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 with
vigilant monitoring. During this admission , the patient received a
total of six units of packed red cells. and had a hematocrit of
30.9 on discharge.
From a urologic standpoint , the patient was followed by Urology
during his hospitalization , who felt that his condition was
secondary to radiation cystitis. Given that he was now having
hematuria to the extent of requiring frequent transfusions , surgery
i.e. a urinary diversion with ileal conduit , will most likely be
necessary in the near future. He will continue to follow-up with
Urology as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Ferrous sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.day , folic
acid 1 mg p.o. q.day , Glyburide 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , sublingual nitroglycerin
p.r.n. chest pain.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in good
condition and will follow-up with Dr. Arthur Matney and also with Dr. Silos as well as Urology.

to exchange generator. Pressure is better , paced externally at
90 BPM.
Respiratory: Saturating well on 2 liters of oxygen delivered by
nasal cannula so was moderate chest tube output.
Diet: Advanced as tolerated.
Renal: Postop increase in creatinine requiring dopamine ,
creatinine now down to 1.5. P.o. Lasix started.
Endocrine: No issues.
Hematology: Anticoagulation with aspirin.
ID: Antibiotics are off. Afebrile.
Elevated white count secondary to myelofibrosis. Transferred to
Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #6. Postop day #7 , 9/19/05 ,
last remaining chest tube removed. Patient still complains of
shortness of breath , saturating well on room air. Chest x-ray

fingers and toes. If color on extremities does not improve on
argatroban , will get vascular to see. So far color in right hand
looks better. Left fingers and toes bilaterally , no worse , no
better. Respiratory status worsens , consider CT angiogram with
contrast to rule out PE with Mucomyst given creatinine of 2.1.

Discharge Date: 7/30/1992
DIAGNOSES: STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANT ON 26 of August
AORTIC DISSECTION.
NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF TOBACCO ABUSE IN THE PAST.
HEPATITIS-C ANTIBODY POSITIVE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 51 year old
gentleman with a history of coronary
artery disease with myocardial infarction in 1977 , status post
coronary artery bypass grafting in 1977 , and myocardial infarction
in 1985 , with redo coronary artery bypass grafting at Oua Medical Center , complicated by cardiogenic shock , treated with an
intra-aortic balloon pump in 1985. Since 24 of November , the patient
reported recurrent congestive heart failure with chest pain and a
variable bundle branch block requiring pacer placement with a DDD
pacer in 1990. He had an electrophysiologic study at the time ,
which was negative for ventricular tachycardia. In 1 of January , the
patient reported to Hobrook Medical Center with severe congestive heart
failure and was transferred to Mi Hospital after
treatment for transplant evaluation. At Tiesi Hospital Medical Center on 3 of March , the patient's work-up included an exercise
tolerance test with oxygen uptake of 11.1 milliliters per kilogram
per minute , and a cardiac catheterization showing an essentially
open left internal mammary artery with saphenous vein grafts and
occluded native vessels. The right atrial pressure was 10 ,
pulmonary artery pressure 54/28/30 , pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure 36 , cardiac output 3.6 , cardiac index 2 , PVR 44 , SVR 1440.
The echocardiogram revealed severely decreased ejection of around
15% with 2+ mitral regurgitation. Other issues included a positive
tobacco history in the past with a moderately decreased FEV-1 of
2.2 , and also hepatitis-C antibody positivity. The patient went
home after evaluation for 2 weeks and did well without fever or
chills. He did have some constipation. For 2 days , he had some
increased cough when lying down similar to his previous congestive
heart failure. The patient was readmitted on the night prior to
transplantation on 9 of September , for increasing congestive heart
failure and Dobutamine treatment. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was as
stated above. ALLERGIES were no known drug allergies. SOCIAL
HISTORY revealed a 25-pack-year history of tobacco , none since
1977. He has 4 children , married. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION on
transfer included digoxin .25 milligrams by mouth each day , Pepcid
20 milligrams by mouth twice a day , captopril 25 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , Lasix 80 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
Ecotrin 1 by mouth each day , Coumadin , Dobutamine drip.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a somewhat cachectic male ,
comfortable with oxygen. Head , eyes , ears ,
nose and throat examination was benign. Neck was supple without
adenopathy. Lungs were clear at the tops with bibasilar crackles.
Cardiovascular examination was notable for S1 , S2 and S3 , no S4 ,
murmur or rub. Abdominal examination was benign. Extremities
showed no edema. Rectal examination revealed guaiac negative
stool , no mass.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , laboratory
values were essentially normal , except for
hyperglycemia , mildly increased liver function tests and creatinine
1.1. On admission , blood urea nitrogen was 18 , creatinine .9 ,
glucose 176 , sodium 137 , potassium 4.1 , prothrombin time 13.1 ,
partial thromboplastin time 29 , calcium 8.5 , albumin 3.7 , magnesium
2 , ALT 17 , alkaline phosphatase 155 , total bilirubin 1.1.
Urinalysis was negative. Hematocrit was 38.8 , platelets 199 , 000 ,
white blood cell count 8.3. The electrocardiogram revealed AV
pacing at 90. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with a pacer with
the wires in the right ventricle. An echocardiogram obtained prior
to transplantation revealed right atrial pressure 10 , pulmonary
artery 54/28/38 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 36 , cardiac
output 3.6 , cardiac index 2 , PVR 44 , SVR 1440 , ejection fraction
15% , 2+ mitral regurgitation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
15 of November , and received an orthotopic heart
transplant. This was complicated by a descending aortic dissection
from the iliac to the left subclavian vein secondary to femoral
catheterization , because the patient had had 2 previous bypasses
and would not have tolerated aortic bypass. The patient did well
postoperatively and was placed on Cyclosporine-A and prednisone.
The patient was weaned off the ventilator and Dobutamine and
diuresed without difficulty. Of note , one of the two preoperative
blood cultures grew out Clostridium perfringens. Three subsequent
blood cultures were negative , however. An Infectious Disease
Service consultation was obtained , and it was felt that intravenous
penicillin for 10 to 14 days , 30 million units every 4 hours , would
be warranted given the patient's underlying immunosuppression. The
patient underwent right ventricular biopsies according to the
protocol , and there was no evidence of rejection on any biopsies.
The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the
aortic dissection on 11 of February , and then follow-up on 10 of March These
revealed a type-B dissection from the left iliac to the subclavian.
The ascending aorta was not involved. There was flow in both the
true and false lumen on both tests. The renal , SMA and ciliac
arteries were all intact. An echocardiogram on 11 of February , revealed
good left ventricular function , a small amount of mitral
regurgitation , some increased pulmonary pressures and the
dissection of the aorta. The patient underwent abdominal
computerized tomography scan to rule out any occult source of
abscess which would be responsible for the Clostridium bacteremia ,
as recommended by the gastroenterology consultant. No such source
was found. The patient's blood pressure was initially controlled
with Nifedipine 3 times a day 30 milligrams , until the patient
reached the expected postoperative denervated tachycardia. After
this point , a beta blocker in the form of atenolol 25 milligrams by
mouth each day was added to decrease force on the wall of the
dissection. The patient was transferred to the Cardiology Service
from the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service on 11 of February , and did well.
Adjustments were made in his Cyclosporine dose. He was initially
tried on some NPH insulin for hyperglycemia , but eventually with
the prednisone taper had good blood sugars on Glyburide 2.5
milligrams by mouth each day. The goal was set for the patient's
blood pressure to be kept at all times below 140 , and this was for
the most part achieved. The patient was anemic during admission ,
but postoperatively gradually his red blood cell count increased.
He was started on iron sulfate to assist in his hematologic
recovery. B12 and folate levels were normal despite polys on
stain. The patient's chest tube wounds were cultured during the
postoperative course and grew normal skin flora. They were packed
with wicks as necessary. The left groin lymph area drained clear
fluid and persisted , but had decreased substantially prior to
discharge. The patient was evaluated by the Psychiatry Service for
some features of hypomania on 17 of May They recommended Valium 5
milligrams by mouth 3 times a day to counter the steroid-induced
hypomania. Physical Therapy Service was active in the patient's
ambulation and felt comfortable that the patient would be able to
go home and manage on his own.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. COMPLICATIONS
included aortic dissection type B from left iliac to
left subclavian. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE were Cyclosporine-A 250
milligrams by mouth twice a day , Imuran 50 milligrams by mouth each
day , prednisone 25 milligrams by mouth each day , atenolol 75
milligrams by mouth each day , Glyburide 2.5 milligrams by mouth
each day , Nifedipine 30 milligrams by mouth 4 times a day ,
Septra-Double-Strength 1 by mouth every other day , Nystatin 15 cc
by mouth 4 times a day , iron sulfate 325 milligrams by mouth 3
times a day , Valium 2.5 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable. The patient was to follow a
low-saturated fat , low-cholesterol , no-added-salt diet. He will
advance his activity as tolerated. The patient was to have a
visiting nurse daily until he feels comfortable with his own care.
The visiting nurse will assist in wound dressing changes , taking
his finger sticks twice a day , taking his blood pressure and
notifying physicians for blood pressure greater than 140. They
were to check differential blood pressures between right and left
arms. The patient will also receive physical therapy assistance to
continue his progress in ambulation. The patient was to FOLLOW-UP
with the Cardiac Transplant Clinic on 28 of November , for routine
FOLLOW-UP.

was in USOH until 6 days PTA when developed bilateral foot pain
typical of gout flare. 5 days PTA developed SOB and heart racing
which was constant. Attributed sx to prednisone and stopped
prednisone 3 days PTA. Yet SOB and sensation of rapid heart rhythm
continued. She had never had the sensation before and has no h/o
tachyarrhythmia. On DOA , she came to ED for evalulation of her bilateral
gouty foot pain and was found to be tachycardic to 150 bpm. EKG notable
for narrow complex tachycardia ( SVT/likely AVNRT. )
. IN ED: given adenosine 6 mg IV x 1 with conversion to NSR for less
than a minutes , and then reversion back to SVT. She responded to
additional adenosine 12 mg IV x 1 and reverted to SR for the remainder of
her hospital stay.

pain 2/2 gout. Found to be in SVT with rate to 150 bpm. Initially ,
high suspicion of PE , given h/o PE , evolution of pleuritic chest pain ,
and SVT. LENI's were negative. She was empirically started on heparin
IV. Yet on HD2 , she had a V/Q scan with NO perfusion defect and heparin
was discontinued. The precipitating event leading to SVT was not
determined. No PE or evidence of ischemic event. However , she had
multiple metabolic derangements , especially hyocalcemia ( Ca 6.0 , iCa
0.79 , Mg. 1.6 ) as well as evidence worsening structural heart disease and
evolving cardiomyopathy. Her SVT resolved after adenosine 12 mg IV x 1
and she remained in SR during the rest of hospital stay. ECHO showed EF
40% , diastolic dysfunction and LVH likely 2/2 longstanding HTN. This
was a change from ECHO in 2002 when she had nl EF 60% , no e/o diastolic
dysfunction and no ventricular enlargement. The cause of her new
cardiomyopathy is possibly HTN and concern raised for high-output state
due increase flow thru AV fistula. We discussed the case briefly with
the vascular surg service. There is no definitive test to determine if
flow throught the aVF is too great. This may need to be discussed between
her primary renal doctors and vascular.
.
HYPOCALCEMIA: VitD level pending , PTH dramatically elevated at 914. Noted
to have elevated QTc of QTC 504 msec in setting hypocalcemia. Calcitriol
was increased and calcium citrate was initiated. Calcium was also
repleted with calcium gluconate boluses and magnesium supplementation.
Ionized calcium was followed. She is being discharged home on Calcium
citrate bid , calcitriol 2mcg qd , and prior dose of ergocalciferol.

CODE: FULL
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted after experiencing a rapid heart rhythm that normalized
after treatment with medicine. There is no clear explanation for why you
went into this abnormal rhythm , there are a few possibilities. These
include disturbances in your electrolytes , such as very low calcium , as
low as changes in your heart from high blood pressure and fluid
retention. You did not have a clot to your lungs or in your legs. You
were started on calcium supplements ( calcium citrate ) , calcitriol dose
was increased. Metoprolol dose was increased to treat your high blood
pressure.
.
KEY MEDICINE CHANGES:
1. Increase metoprolol dose
2. Increase calcitriol dose
3. Start calcium citrate: takes this medicine BETWEEN meals , as it will
be less effective if taken with meals.
4. It is important that you take all prescribed medicines to keep your
heart healthy and to make sure your electrolytes and calcium stay in
acceptable limits. If you have problems filling your medicines , please
notifiy your primary or renal doctors.
.
Contact a physician or return to the emergency room if you develop
recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , sensation of rapid heart
rhythm that does not go away after a few minutes or comes on with
breathing problems or chest pain.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Check metabolic panel , including calcium.
2. F/u on vitamin D level ( pending at d/c )
3. Check BP on elevated dose metoprolol ER

Discharge Date: 4/26/2000
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CHEST PAIN OF UNCLEAR ETIOLOGY.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Veltin is a 72 year old woman
with a past medical history
significant for coronary artery disease , diabetes , and hypertension
who presented with worsening chest pain and shortness of breath.
She had a long history of coronary artery disease with an exercise
stress test in 1997 that was positive for ischemic ST-T wave
changes. She had a catheterization at that time which revealed
diffuse three vessel disease , none of which was significant. In
1998 , she developed a left bundle branch on her EKG but it was not
clear when exactly this happened. She stated that for the past
year , she got these stabbing pains in the center of her chest that
then progressed to a squeezing pain with palpitations. Sometimes ,
there was relation to exertion but no relation to meals or position
and this chest pain had been increasing in frequency over the past
two to three weeks so now it occurred approximately two to three
times a week and was associated with shortness of breath. Two days
prior to admission , she developed constant chest pain that went to
her left arm and made four of her left fingers numb. She was quite
short of breath though she denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ,
orthopnea , lower extremity edema , increased nocturia , and diet or
medication noncompliance.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant also for diabetes for which she
took insulin and checked her sugars at home
which ran 170 range to 200 range , hypertension , and she had
idiopathic drop attacks. She got these episodes where her legs
fell out from under her without warning but she did not lose
consciousness. She had had an MRI/MRA that showed some diffuse
small vessel disease but the MRA was normal.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25
q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , simvastatin 10
q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , and NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin caused a rash and intravenous contrast dye
caused hives.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She was a retired nurses' aide who retired in
1992 , she was a widow , and she had two living
children who were grown. She lived alone and took care of her
eight year old great-grandson but had a daughter and son-in-law who
lived next door.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , significant for an elderly
obese African-American woman lying in bed in
some mild respiratory distress. Her oropharynx was moist , her
jugular venous pressure was 12 cm , her lungs had scattered crackles
at the bases , her heart was regular with an S4 , her belly was soft
and nontender , her extremities had trace edema , and her rectal
examination showed guaiac negative brown stool.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her EKG showed a left bundle branch block
and chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary
edema and Kerley B lines. Her laboratories on admission were all
within normal limits. Her initial CK was 97 with troponin of 0.01.
ASSESSMENT: In summary , this is a 72 year old woman with multiple
cardiac risk factors who presented with chest pain of
unclear etiology. She was admitted for evaluation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - She was admitted for
catheterization which showed three vessel
disease , again nonsignificant and not changed from the
catheterization in 1997. She ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. She had an echo which showed some element of diastolic
dysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 36 plus RA
but no wall motion abnormalities. It was felt that she had some
element of diastolic dysfunction that caused her to go into a bit
of pulmonary edema , maybe subendocardial ischemia. Therefore ,
while she was maintained on her aspirin and simvastatin , her blood
pressure regimen was advanced. Her heart rate was in the fifties
to sixties and Atenolol 50 b.i.d. was added. She was on a maximum
of Lisinopril at 40 milligrams so nifedipine extended release was
added and titrated up to 120 milligrams q.d. where she maintained
systolic blood pressures in the 160 range nevertheless. This could
be further titrated as an outpatient.
2. For her congestive heart failure , she diuresed approximately
four liters through admission with Lasix at 40 intravenously and
would be discharged on a seven day course of Lasix at 20 p.o. q.d.
for further diuresis.
3. Pulmonary - She did have hypoxia on admission to 85% on room
air while lying in bed. This was felt to be out of proportion to
her mild congestive heart failure and further causes were sought.
Her D-dymer was greater than 1000 and she then went for a V/Q scan
which was low probability. Her lower extremity noninvasives were
negative. She also had a chest CT which showed no interstitial
lung disease. She had pulmonary function tests which were
consistent with restrictive picture and were not much changed from
her pulmonary function tests in 1998. A pulmonary consultation was
obtained who believed that the congestive heart failure along with
obesity underlying restrictive lung disease could be the cause of
her hypoxia and , in fact , after further diuresis , her shortness of
breath much improved and she had O2 saturations that were 93% on
room air.
4. Endocrine - She was maintained on metformin during admission
and also on half of her dose of her normal dose of NPH given her
decreased p.o. intake , however , given the fact that she stated that
her sugars at home on her regimen of 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m. were
170 to 200 , she was discharged on this regimen with instructions to
check her sugar and call her doctor if they were low.
DISPOSITION: She is discharged in stable condition on January ,
2000. She will follow up with Dr. Nakajima , her primary
care doctor , and in addition , with Dr. Klang , her cardiologist.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25

Discharge Date: 4/8/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANT.
OTHER DIAGNOSIS: ORAL HERPES.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old man with
a longstanding history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure who was originally
admitted on 30 of March with worsening fatigue and dyspnea on exertion
for augmentation of cardiac function. He was well until l96l when
he initially presented with left bundle-branch block , left
ventricular hypertrophy , and transient chest pain. He then had
high grade ventricular ectopic activity in l972 treated with
Quinaglute. Subsequently from l972 to l988 , examination was
notable for worsening left ventricular function. In l988 , he had
recurrent frequent congestive heart failure and underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed an enlarged hypokinetic ventricle with
an ejection fraction of around 32%. His coronary arteries showed
acute marginal of 70% stenosis and 40% of the mid circumflex. In
1/5 , his ejection fraction by right ventriculogram was 20%. In
2/8 , he had atypical pneumonia followed by recurrent congestive
heart failure. Subsequent course was notable for dyspnea on
exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea. He was
treated with Lasix , Zaroxolyn , Captopril , and Quinaglute. In
March , he was admitted to the Worthrest Hospital for
worsening symptoms , weight gain , and creatinine of 2.9. He was
managed with decreased Lasix , increased Captopril , and ultimately
decided to treate with Lasix and Zaroxolyn. He was then placed on
the Cardiac Transplant List and underwent transplant evaluation.
Exercise tolerance test showed 8 minutes and 43 seconds bicycle
with O2 uptake of l2. Right heart catheterization showed wedge
pressure of 25. PPD was negative and abdominal ultrasound was
negative. Echo showed global left ventricular dysfunction , apical
thrombus , mild tricuspid regurgitation , and mild mitral
regurgitation. Cholesterol was l53 , l-2 immunoglobulins within
normal limits , and toxo was plus IgG and minus IgM. He had
negative hepatitis , histo , blasto , or coccidiomycosis. CMV showed
borderline IgG and negative IgM and EBV showed positive IgG and
negative IgM. Since his discharge in August , he has noted
worsening of symptoms with decreased exercise tolerance and
increased orthopnea.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and ended up being
started on Dobutamine and had gradually declining
course during his admission culminating in having a cardiac
transplant when a heart became available. This occurred on
10/9/9l. His post-operative course was uncomplicated and his
subsequent course was complicated only by acute worsening of his
renal function associated with high Cyclosporin levels with the
Cyclosporin held and the level allowed to come down. His renal
function returned to baseline. He also developed an oral herpes
lesion. He subsequently did very well post-operatively. Multiple
right ventricular biopsies were negative for rejection. On biopsy
on 11/21 , his wedge pressure was l8 , right atrial pressure l3 ,
right ventricular 48/l4 , and PA pressure of 48/24. He tolerated
slow taper of his steroids without event and it was noted that he
had some tremor also post-operatively which was attributed to
Cyclosporin toxicity. Other than that , his post-operative course
was uncomplicated.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home on 1/13/9l. He is
to have follow-up with Dr. Blay as well as Dr. Hori
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Persantine 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Clotrimazole

ALLERGIES: Penicillin and sulfa.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies tobacco , alcohol , or IV drug
use. She has two children and lives alone since hospitalization.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 99.2 , pulse 89 ,
blood pressure 130/86 , respiratory rate 20 , and oxygen saturation
100% on room air. General , the patient is in no acute distress ,
but is unable to talk with the trach tube currently in place.
HEENT , mucous membranes are moist and there are no OP lesions.
Neck , JVP is not appreciated due to the patient's body habitus.
Cardiovascular , heart rate is regular , regular rhythm , no
murmurs , gallops , or rubs. Chest , decreased breath sounds in all
fields with a prolonged expiratory phase. Abdomen , bowel sounds
are present , abdomen is obese , nontender , and there is a G tube
in place. Extremities , no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema.
Extremities are obese. Skin , no rashes or bruises. Neurologic ,
no cranial nerve , sensory , or motor deficits noted. Gait is
deferred.
LABORATORY FINDINGS ON ADMISSION: The patient's CBC reveals a
hematocrit of 29.2 , which is consistent with her baseline of 28
to 30. Her CBC , chem-7 , and LFTs are all unremarkable.
PROCEDURES:
1. Trach tube change - the patient's tracheostomy tube was
changed to a Custom #6 Bivona on 10/21/05 by Dr. Klatt ( Surgery ).
2. Bronchoscopy - A bronchoscopy was performed on 5/28/05 and
revealed erythematous soft tissue in the posterior pharynx ,
compromising the airway above the trach tube. Granulation tissue
was noted above the site of the trach tube that also appeared to
potentially compromise the airway.
3. Modified barium swallow - modified barium swallow was
performed on 10/21/05 , which revealed a moderate aspiration risk.
The patient was recommended for a mechanical soft diet.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Trach change: On admission , the patient was admitted to the
General Medical Service for problems with her trach tube. Over
the course of this admission , her trach tube did become dislodged
on numerous occasions. During these times , either surgery or
respiratory therapy were required to reinsert the trach tube.
However , the patient remained stable throughout these events with
a pulse oximetry reading greater than 92% , even when the
tube became dislodged. The patient required a Custom fit #6
Bivona cuffless trach tube. Dr. Avellano ( General Surgery ) inserted this tube
without incident. Initially , the patient did feel some irritation once the
tube was inserted , however , this resolved with deep suctioning and nebulizer
therapy. Once inserted , the new trach tube fit well and the
patient was comfortable , with oxygen saturations greater than 92%
on trach mask oxygen.
2. Redundant oropharyngeal tissue: During this admission , the
patient underwent a bronchoscopy to evaluate for possibile
decannulation. However , this procedure revealed
excessive tissue in her upper oropharynx and
what appeared to be edematous tissue in the airway. The significance of this
finding was uncertain , although it was felt that this tissue could
compromise the airway if her trach tube was removed. Therefore ,
the patient should not be decannulated without repeat evaluation of her
upper airway. Throughout this hospital
course , the patient had her trach tube in place. She was able to
use a Passey-Muir valve for speaking and she may continue to use
one with her trach tube in place.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of
recurrent pneumonia and poor pulmonary function , the patient
underwent a modified barium swallow evaluation for possible
aspiration pneumonia. She was found to have some difficulty
during this evaluation , and Speech and Swallow recommended the
patient continue a mechanical soft diet without fluid
restrictions indefinitely. During this hospital course , the
patient had been on tube feeds through her G tube , although these
may be tapered once the patient is tolerating oral food well.
COMPLICATIONS: None.
CONSULTANTS: Dr. August Adkinson , General Surgery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: On discharge , the patient's
temperature was 97.8 , pulse 81 , blood pressure 122/84 ,
respiratory rate 22 , and oxygen saturation 100% on supplemental
oxygen of 30% by trach mask. General , no acute distress ,
pleasant , obese woman. HEENT , mucous membranes are moist.
Pupils are round. Extraocular movements are intact. Neck , JVP
could not be assessed. Chest , distant breath sounds with
occasional wheezes , but no appreciable crackles or rhonchi.
Cardiovascular , S1 and S2 intact , regular , but distant heart
sounds. Abdomen is obese , soft , and nontender , positive bowel
sounds , without appreciable masses. Extremities are obese , but
without edema.

increasing edema , fatigue , and weight gain. He was found to have
worsening renal function at Leyjery Townpark Tuli Hospital Health Center At rehab ,
attempts at diuresis had been unsuccessful with increasing
diuretic doses. As he became increasingly volume overloaded , he
began to complain of left neck pain and swelling as well as left
lower extremity edema. In addition , his mental status became
increasingly more somnolent and he began to have twitching
movements of his upper extremities. At admission to Burg Hospital , Mr. Roberg denied chest pain , shortness of
breath. He did note approximately four days of left neck pain.
He also denied abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea. He
did note some constipation. He denied any fevers or chills.

ALLERGIES:
Mr. Shanafelt has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
His temperature was 96.2 degrees Fahrenheit. His heart rate was
62 beats per minute and his blood pressure was 170/72. His
oxygen saturation was 99% on 2 liters. He was awake and alert
and in no acute distress. His jugular venous pressure was
approximately 12 cm of water. His heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and a systolic murmur at the left
upper sternal border. He did not have any signs of pulses
paradoxes. His lungs had decreased breath sounds at the right
base with rales at the left base. His abdomen was soft and
distended but nontender. There were normoactive bowel sounds.
The extremities had 1+ pitting edema bilaterally at the shins.
His neurologic exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:
His sodium was 134 and his potassium was 3.4. His chloride was
100 and his bicarb was 21. His BUN was 140 and his creatinine
was 7.0. His white blood cell count was 8.4 and his hematocrit
was 26.1. His INR was 2.5. His calcium was 9.0. His EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm at the rate of 61 beats per minute. This was
a paced rhythm. His chest x-ray showed volume overload and
cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Renal: On admission , Mr. Muraski had significant volume
overload with weight gain , edema , and chest x-ray evidence of
pulmonary edema. He also had significant azotemia with a BUN of
140. His creatinine had also increased from his baseline
creatinine of 5.0 to 7.0 at admission. His physical examination
the morning after admission showed worsening somnolence and slow
asterixis with jerky myoclonic movements. On 8/26/05 , the
tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed in his right internal
jugular vein by interventional radiology. This procedure was
tolerated without complication. Mr. Stahlnecker had his first run of
hemodialysis on 9/27/05 , which he tolerated well with subsequent
improvement in his mental status and resolution of his asterixis.
He again underwent hemodialysis on 5/30/05 , 9/15/05 and
9/14/05. In addition , he underwent a two-hour run of
ultrafiltration on 5/24/05 with removal of nearly four liters of
fluid. Mr. Lavergne will continue with intermittent hemodialysis
on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday schedule after discharge from
Belllit Community Hospital . Plans are underway for Mr. Schroeppel
to have an AV fistula placed. He has a follow-up appointment on
4/3/05 with vascular surgery at F.shands Ieldmormode Hospital .
2. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: Mr. Grassman was maintained
on a renal diet. He was started on Nephrocaps multivitamin. On
9/27/05 , he was started on Phoslo 667 mg t.i.d. for a phosphorus
level of 5.8. However , on 5/24/05 , his phosphorus level was 1.8
and therefore his Phoslo was held.
3. Cardiovascular: Mr. Wallau has a long history of
hypertension and he is treated with multiple medications. His
systolic blood pressures have ranged in the 160-180s during this
admission. He was continued on his Norvasc and labetolol. He
was also continued on hydralazine at 100 mg t.i.d. In addition ,
lisinopril was added and titrated to 10 mg p.o. daily. In
addition , he was continued on his clonidine at 0.6 mg b.i.d. Mr.
Bacus blood pressure did not return to a normal level after he
was dialyzed repeatedly. His blood pressure will need to be
continued to be monitored at rehab with potentially additional
medicines added. In addition , Mr. Mok has a history of
coronary artery disease with recent non-ST elevation MI. He was
initially due to be discharged on 9/15/05 , but shortly after
hemodialysis , he had one 15-minute episode of sharp left-sided
chest pain. He was therefore ruled out for myocardial infarction
with serial enzymes and EKGs. He showed no evidence of
myocardial infarction.
4. Hematology: Mr. Buetti is maintained on Coumadin for history
of deep venous thrombosis. When he was first admitted , his
Coumadin was held in preparation for placement of a tunneled
hemodialysis catheter. He received one oral dose of vitamin K as
well as fresh frozen plasma prior to placement of the line. He
was subsequently restarted on his Coumadin and it was titrated
while being treated with antibiotics. His previous dose was 4 mg
and he will be discharged on that dose.
5. Endocrine: Mr. Woodburn has a history of diabetes mellitus and
was maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale.
6. Infectious Disease: Mr. Goodyear became febrile to 101 degrees
Fahrenheit on 1/13/05. He was again febrile on 9/14/05. His
urine culture grew out enterobacter cloacae , which was
subsequently found to be pan resistant. Prior to his
sensitivities being obtained , he was treated with levofloxacin.
When it was determined that the enterobacter was resistant to
levofloxacin , he was switched to gentamicin 60 mg IV x1 on
1/18/05. He should receive several additional days of
gentamicin approximately five or six days. He should be dosed
after hemodialysis for a gentamicin level less than 5. Mr.
Montogomery did have one positive blood culture from 7/18/05 that
grew out gram-positive cocci in clusters at the time of this
dictation. There was only one out of four bottles that grew out
these gram-positive cocci. He did receive one dose of vancomycin
in the early morning of 1/18/05. It was felt that this blood
culture most likely represented a contaminant. All of his other
blood cultures remained negative at the time of this dictation.
DISPOSITION:
Mr. Mckean will be discharged to the Westjo Hospital His
blood pressure and INR will need to be monitored. He will
continue on hemodialysis three times per week. He has an
appointment at vascular surgery on 4/3/05 to plan for AV
fistula formation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
He was afebrile. He was alert and conversational. He had
occasional rales at his bases. His heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with a 1/6 systolic murmur at his left sternal border.
His abdomen had normoactive bowel sounds , it was soft , nontender ,
and nondistended. His extremities were warm and there was no
edema. He showed no signs of uremia with no asterixis.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Almon is a 51 year old gentleman
with history of insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus and unstable angina. The patient was doing yard
work in the afternoon when he experienced an episode of nausea and
vomiting along with chest discomfort. The patient presented to his
primary care physician who noted EKG changes with ST depressions in
V3 to V6 and was sent to the emergency room which was noted to have
an old T wave inversion in lead 3 which was now upright and ST
depressions that were normalizing. CKs at that time were 974 , MB
24.3 , Troponin level was 1.77. The patient received aspirin 5 mg
of intravenous Lopressor , Heparin drip and Adenosine MIBI which was
performed back in April of 1999 revealed inferior ischemia. The
patient underwent cardiac catheterization on June , 2001 which
revealed the following: Right dominant system , no significant left
main lesions identified , left anterior descending coronary artery
with a discreet mid 65% lesion , distal 99% lesion and first
diagonal coronary artery with a proximal discrete 70% lesion , left
circumflex coronary artery with a distal after the second obtuse
marginal discrete 60% lesion , supplying the second obtuse marginal.
First marginal coronary artery had an ostial discrete 90% lesion
and a second obtuse marginal had an ostial discrete 100% lesion.
Right coronary artery had a mid discrete 95% lesion supplying the
right posterior descending coronary artery. He was also noted to
have collateral flow from left anterior descending artery to the
right posterior descending artery. The patient underwent
echocardiogram on June , 2001 which revealed the following: 1.
There was mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced
with an estimated ejection fraction of 45%. There is severe
hypokinesis of the basal and mid segments of the inferior wall and
inferior septum. In addition , there is severe hypokinesis of the
posterior wall , apex and distal anterior wall. THis is suggestive
of multiple coronary artery disease. 2. The right ventricle
appears normal in size and systolic function. 3. The mitral valve
appears mildly thickened. The anterior mitral leaflet is mildly
elongated and there might be mild systolic prolapse of the anterior
leaflet. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen. 4. The aortic valve
is trileaflet and appears mildly thickened. There is no aortic
stenosis or regurgitation. 5. The tricuspid valve appears
structurally normal. No significant tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. 6. There is no pericardial effusion.

platelets 317 , 000. Sodium 138 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 96 ,
bicarbonate 28 , BUN 102 , and creatinine 2.8. Glucose was 88.
Otherwise , she was not coagulopathic and normal liver function
tests , and a negative set of cardiac enzymes. Her EKG on
admission showed she was ventricularly paced at 54 beats per
minute and that her EKG was unchanged from her prior EKG from
September , 2005.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Cardiovascular pump: Initially , the patient's Imdur and
labetalol were held out of concern for hypertension and poor
renal perfusion. However , on the hospital day #1 without IV
hydration and holding of her p.o. blood pressure medications.
Her creatinine returned towards baseline , value is 2.3. As such ,
the patient was restarted on her home Imdur on February ,
2005. However , her spironolactone continued to be held. In
addition , her torsemide was held. Her urine output was
monitored , revealed that she put out over 2 L on her second
hospital day. As such , the patient was started on home dose of
beta-blocker Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. daily on hospital day #2 as
well as once daily dosing of her torsemide 60 mg. The patient's
creatinine continued to improve. It was felt that the patient
was achieving good forward systolic flow and then her
hypertension was resolved with blood pressures ranging from the
130s to 150s on hospital day #2. However , over the course of
hospital admission , the patient was felt to be retaining fluid
with a weight of 99 kg , up from an admission weight of 97 kg. As
the patient had previous admissions for pulmonary edema and CHF
exacerbation , it was felt that the patient should be more
aggressively diuresed to prevent pulmonary edema. As such , the
patient restarted on her home torsemide 60 mg , however , continued
to gain weight and retained fluid. As such , the patient was
changed to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix 2 days prior to discharge
and was maintained on that dose achieving over 1 L of net
diureses on the 2 days prior to her discharge. She was
discharged on 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix and achieves good effect
and maintaining adequate blood pressure.
2. Ischemia: The patient continued her home Lipitor and aspirin
doses for known coronary artery disease. However , overnight , the
evening of August , 2005 , and the morning of February ,
2005 , she developed irritant anginal pain radiating to her jaw.
Imdur had been held at admission for concern of hypertension , but
was restarted for her anginal pain and she responded well. There
were no EKG changes for this event , and her cardiac enzymes ,
which were excessive , currently negative. She was maintained on
aspirin , Lipitor , Imdur and p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin for
the remainder of her admission. She had no further chest pain
events.
3. Rhythm and rate: The patient was ventricularly paced and
maintained on telemetry. She was continued on her amiodarone 200
mg p.o. daily over her hospital course and tolerated this with
good effect. She also continued her Coumadin at 1.5 mg p.o.
daily for known atrial fibrillation and achieved a therapeutic PT
at 2.8. The patient had no complications or events from her
rhythm or rate standpoint.
4. Renal: The patient's creatinine returned to baseline by
hospital day #3. It was felt that her acute and chronic renal
failure may have been related to poor p.o. intake prior to
admission and subsequent hypovolemia. The patient had no further
issues from a renal standpoint and did not require aggressive
hydration , taking good p.o. On November , 2005 , the patient
developed an episode of 10/10 left flank pain with associated
nausea , but no vomiting , lasting 30 minutes , which she reported
was due to known gallstone in the neck of her gallbladder ,
identified by a CT of the abdomen without contrast within the
past year and by ultrasound in 2004. However , given the
dislocation of the pain , it was felt that this also may be
related to renal colic and as such , a CT of the abdomen stone
protocol was obtained on November , 2005 , which showed no
evidence of a kidney stone , however , did demonstrate once again
gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. The patient responded
well to 30 mg p.o. codeine for pain control and had resolution of
her symptoms by August , 2005 , hospital day #3.
5. Gastrointestinal: The known biliary colic had resolved by
August , 2005. The patient was continued on p.r.n. codeine
p.o. 30 mg q.6h. and Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg q.6h. p.r.n. The
patient did not require IV morphine , requesting not to use
narcotics , and had no further events of pain on her hospital
course.
6. Endocrine: The patient was initially started on her home
dose of NPH insulin 47 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. and
regular insulin sliding scale. The a.m. fingersticks were low ,
ranging from the 60s to the 70s as were her p.m. fingersticks.
This was felt to be due to decreased p.o. in the hospital
setting. As such , the diabetes service after consultation
recommended decreasing her NPH insulin dose to 35 units q.a.m.
and her p.m. insulin to 10 units q.p.m. The patient requested
minimal injections during her hospital course and at home. As
such , there was still preprandial insulin administered , as the
patient continued to express preference for twice daily
injections. The patient achieved goal fingersticks over her
hospital course and was discharged on regimen of NPH insulin. In
addition , a TSH was obtained during the hospital course which
showed a level of 19 , being elevated , as such her Synthroid was
increased to 150 mcg daily. She will follow up with her
endocrinologist to repeat her TSH and hemoglobin A1c.
7. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: The patient was restarted
on her K-Dur 40 mEq q.a.m. and 20 mEq q.p.m. for potassium loss
secondary to diureses. Her electrolytes remained stable over
course of her hospital stay. She was continued on a
low-cholesterol low-fat diet and ADA diet.
8. Infectious Disease: The patient had a UA with 8 to 10 white
blood cells , concerning for possible low-grade UTI , especially
given her initial presenting symptoms. As such , she was started
on a 3-day course of Bactrim , and completed this course. She
remained afebrile over the course of her hospitalization and her
urine culture , which showed only 50 , 000 colony-forming units of
mixed flora , her white blood cell count remained within normal
limits over her hospital admission. As such , no further therapy
was required.
9. The patient was discharged home on January , 2005 , with
VNA services.
PLAN FOLLOWING DISCHARGE:
1. To have her endocrinologist follow up her hemoglobin A1c and
to repeat her TSH level to maximize her insulin regimen as well
as her Synthroid regimen.
2. To have followup with Dr. Polashek in the Coumadin Clinic to
maximize her Coumadin therapy and ensure that she is therapeutic.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.

2.2 , BNP 18 , white blood cell count 8 , hematocrit 35.2 ,
hemoglobin 11.9 , platelets 313 , PT 13.7 , INR 1 , and PTT 31.5.
Carotid imaging: Left and right internal carotid arteries , both
with 0% occlusion. Cardiac catheterization performed at Iland Frenchcal Clami General Hospital on 10/18/06 showed stenosis in the following
coronary arteries: 70% proximal PDA , 90% proximal LAD , 70% mid
circumflex with right dominant circulation. Ventriculogram
showed an ejection fraction of 35%. EKG on 4/5/06 showed
normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 63. There was poor
R-wave progression in the precordial leads and inverted T waves
in leads III , V5 and V6. Chest x-ray on 4/5/06 was consistent
with congestive heart failure and an enlarged cardiac silhouette.
There is mild CHF , bilateral atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on the day prior to
her scheduled surgery for completion of her preoperative workup.
On 5/26/06 , she was brought to the operating room where Dr.
Gonzale performed a CABG x3 using the LIMA to bypass the LAD and
saphenous vein graft to bypass the OM1 and saphenous vein graft
to bypass the PDA. The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 107
minutes and the aortic cross-clamp time was 83 minutes. The vein
was harvested from both legs. The patient was transferred to the
Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit after her surgery where she remained
intubated for two days due to poor lung
compliance. She was also hypotensive in the postoperative period
and treated with vasoactive medications. By postoperative day
#2 , the patient was extubated and hemodynamically stable ,
however , she experienced atrial fibrillation overnight and her
Lopressor was increased. By post-operative day #3 , her atrial fibrillation
was rate controlled and she was started on Coumadin. By
postoperative day #4 , she was ready for transfer from the ICU to
the Step-Down Unit. At that point , she was neurologically intact
and her pain was well controlled. She was being treated with
beta-blockers and Coumadin for AFib. From a respiratory
perspective , the patient was being treated with aggressive
pulmonary toilet and chest PT. Her chest x-ray showed a small
right pleural effusion and she was oxygenating well with
supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient's diet was
advanced as tolerated and she exhibited adequate urine output.
The patient was treated with Lasix for postoperative fluid
retention. She also was seen by the Diabetes Management Service
throughout her postoperative stay for optimal glycemic control.
On the step-down Unit on postoperative day #5 , the patient
experienced a bradycardic incident with a heart rate of 38 and
she became hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 after her
diltiazem was increased. She was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit where she was observed for three more days.
During that time , the patient's hemodynamics stabilized although
she remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation. On
postoperative day #8 , she was ready again to transfer back to the
Step-Down Unit where she spent the remaining six days of her
hospital stay. The patient's chest x-ray suggested that she was
volume overloaded and the patient was aggressively treated with
Lasix and Zaroxolyn as her creatinine began to increase slowly
from 1.3 to 1.5 to 1.7. The diuretics were decreased. A chest
ultrasound to evaluate pleural effusion for thoracentesis
revealed that the patient had considerable atelectasis and
minimal effusion. The focus then became on chest PT , pulmonary
toilet and deep breathing and coughing. The patient continued to
ambulate with physical therapy and by postoperative day #13 , the
patient's chest x-ray showed improvement of the atelectasis in
the right lung and the patient had decreased oxygen requirements.
From a cardiac perspective in the Step-Down Unit , the patient
was in atrial fibrillation from postoperative days #9 through #11
and then converted to a sinus rhythm where she remained for the
final three days of her hospital stay. The patient had been
started on Coumadin for her postoperative atrial fibrillation and
this medication should continue at least until she follow up with
a cardiologist in an outpatient setting to reevaluated her heart
rhythm. By postoperative day #14 , the patient was in a sinus
rhythm with a stable blood pressure. She was oxygenating well on
room air and was ambulating effectively on her own. She had no
complaints and was ready for discharge to home. On that day , her
temperature was 96.4 degrees , heart rate 76 and sinus rhythm ,
blood pressure 110/60 , respiratory rate 18 , O2 saturation 94% on
room air. The patient was seven kilograms below her preoperative
weight.

ASSESSMENT AND HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM
55F with ESRD on HD ( 2/2 DM ) who had apparent syncopal episode while
at HD on 7/12 , which was similar in presentation to 4/11 episode from
recent admission.
1 ) CV: Whether or not pt actually ever a V-fib arrest seems to be in some
doubt , as she has never had an arrhythmia on tele. However , given this
is the second presentation , a proper arrhythmia evaluation was
warranted. The pt's differential included arrythmia vs obesity
hypoventilation ( pt reports OSA sx ) , hypoglycemia , and HD-related
hypotension. Ischemia ) serial cardiac enzymes negative. Pt was
continued on asa , bb , and placed on statin and NTG prn while ruling out
ischemic heart disease in anticipation of possible EP study. PET
perfusion scan for reversible ischemia was negative , showing normal
perfusion. Pump: JVP not appreciated , decreased LE edema relative to
prior admission. pt was continued home dose diuretic , and kept on a BB ,
CCB , and her ACEi to goal SBP<120. Rhythm: Pt was placed on telemetry to
monitor for arrythmia while on floor. No events were noted , but given
history , pt was taken to cath lab for EP study on 4/19/06. EPS showed
normal conduction , normal SA node , and so a loop recorder device was
implanted , which will monitor pt's HR and record if HR> or < parameters ,
or if pt triggers device to record. No signs/sx of bleeding , infectino ,
hematoma. Pt discharged on 3 day course of Keflex , to be given after HD.
RENAL: ESRD on HD. Pt HD on Wed and Sat am of admission , which she
tolerated with no difficulty. Pt was continued on EPO 10 , 000U qHD. Pt
has tunneled line in Right IJ for access.
HEME: Anemia: in setting of ESRD , baseline Hct around 30. Pt on
epogen. Anemia studies WNL.
ENDO: Diabetes type 2: Long and short-acting SC insulin. BID NPH
started at lower than home dose while oral diet is held , with lower
sliding scales , due to significant parts os stay where pt was NPO for
procedures. Wil lbe discharged on home insulin regimen.
ID: pt reports 4 day h/o productive cough prior to admission. Pt
afebrile , but on HD6 , pt has eleavtion in WBC ( 6.9-->12 ) , however
pt afebrile , asymptomatic , CXR shows no infiltrative process , and in
setting of recent procedure. Pt was placed on levofloxacin renally dosed.
DERM: Brawny skin changes: Lac Hydrin started. Candidiasis noted in folds
between pt's pannus and groin. 2% Miconazole topical poder started
PPX: PT received heparin SC , and Nexium , wil be discharged on protonix.
Code: Pt is Full Code. Health care proxy is Brain Bruess

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You have been evaluated for your unresponsive episodes. We looked at
your heart and put a recorder in your chest to monitor for any irregular
heartbeats. Please follow up with your appointments , and return to the
hospital if you notice any chest pain , lightheadedness , or if you pass out

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of 3-packs-per-day
smoking for 30 years and no alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of heart disease.
PHYSICAL EXAM: On presentation , T 97.3 , BP 143/70 , pulse 57 , 98%
on 2 liters. This is an obese female in no apparent distress ,
sitting up in bed. HEENT: Extraocular movements intact. Sclerae
anicteric. Neck: Supple , JVP at 14 cm. Chest: Crackles
bilaterally , left greater than right , half way up both lung
fields with mild decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No
murmur , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Soft , nontender , and
nondistended with positive bowel sound and no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities with 3+ edema as well as areas of erythematous and
shiny shallow ulcerations. Neurologically , euthymic without
focal deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , significant for sodium 147 ,
potassium 3.4 , chloride 110 , CO2 26 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.6 , and
glucose 69. CBC was significant for white count of 6.7 ,
hematocrit 39.4 , and platelets of 258. Her CK was 432. Her
troponin was less than assay. Her BNP was greater than assay and
D-dimer was 50 and 69.
Chest x-ray showed decreased lung volumes with moderate cardiac
enlargement. EKG showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 59 ,
axis of -36 and no acute changes.
ASSESSMENT: This is a 63-year-old woman with history of
congestive heart failure who presented with likely congestive
heart failure exacerbation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: There was concern regarding acute
and subacute silent ischemia given new ST-T wave changes in
lateral leads on the EKG. The patient was continued on her
aspirin as well as statin. She was ruled out for an MI with
negative troponins x 3. She was continued on a low-dose
short-acting beta-blocker ( Lopressor ). She was also continued on
an ACE inhibitor with this switched to captopril as a
short-acting ACE inhibitor , which was titrated up as tolerated
for a goal blood pressure of systolic of 120. An adenosine MIBI
was performed which was negative for perfusion defects. However ,
echo showed global hypokinesis with depressed ejection fraction.
Cardiology consult was called and they recommended further workup
with cardiac catheterization. However , the patient refused the
catheterization.
Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
However , she remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout her
admission. She was monitored by cardiac telemetry with several
episodes of 6 to 10 beats of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia. Her electrolytes were carefully monitored and
repleted as necessary. She remained asymptomatic with the runs
of NSVT and was continued on her beta-blocker. Given her history
of atrial fibrillation as well as depressed ejection fraction ,
she was restarted on Coumadin.
Pump: The patient presented with a frank fluid overload with
elevated JVP , lower extremity edema , and a BNP greater than
assay. She was aggressively diuresed with a goal of greater than
-2 liters a day. She responded to 80 mg of IV Lasix t.i.d. Her
creatinine was carefully followed and did increase on 11/26/03 ,
at which point diuresis was put on hold. The patient diuresed
about 3 to 4 liters each day during her hospital stay until
7/7/03. At this point , she was thought to be very close to
euvolemic.
Given the patient's echo findings with depressed ejection
fraction and global hypokinesis , a workup for dilated
cardiomyopathy was begun. The patient did not wish for further
investigation with cardiac catheterization or a cardiac MRI. Her
other labs were unremarkable including a TSH , which was normal ,
an ANA which was negative , iron studies which did not show iron
overload , and thiamine which is pending at the time of this
dictation. The patient will require close followup with careful
fluid balance monitoring as well as followup with congestive
heart failure service.
Pulmonary: She initially presented with shortness of breath.
However , this resolved with diuresis. She has a history of PE as
well as DVT and an elevated dimer was found on admission. There
was initial concern for pulmonary embolism , but the resolution of
symptoms with diuresis and a history that was not suggestive of
pulmonary emboli , did not require further followup with spiral
chest CT.
Heme: The patient's hematocrit was followed. The patient has
chronic folate and iron-deficiency anemia and she was continued
on folate and iron replacement.
Endocrine: The patient was continued on NPH 20 units for her
known diabetes. Her blood sugars were in excellent control on
this regimen. Avandia was held given it contraindication in
heart failure.
Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.6 on admission , which is up
from about 0.8 in October of 2003. Her urine eosinophils and
sediment were unremarkable , but frank proteinuria was noted which
is consistent with her known nephrotic syndrome. Her creatinine
remained stable in the 1.5 to 1.6 range until 11/26/03 , when her
creatinine bumped to 2 and kept rising until 1/28/03 , when it
reached 2.7. Repeat urine electrolytes , urine eosinophils and
sediment were sent at this point and they are pending at the time
of this dictation. The most likely explanation for increasing
creatinine was aggressive diuresis and intravascular volume
depletion. Diuresis was put on hold on 11/2/03 and 10/10/03.
Given her increased creatinine , her ACE inhibitor dose was halfed
on 10/10/03. The plan is to continue to monitor her creatinine
function , follow up on her urine chemistries and if her
creatinine resolves , to resume gentle diuresis as necessary.
Infectious Disease: The patient was found to have a UTI with E.
Coli that was sensitive to Bactrim and she was treated with
Bactrim with resolution.
Rheumatological: The patient with known chronic pain as well as
arthritis. Her Celebrex was held given her increased creatinine
and its propensity to cause fluid retention. Her joint exam
revealed swollen PIP joints of both hands as well as marked
swelling over both wrists. A rheumatoid factor was sent and that
came back negative. For her pain , she was given oxycodone p.r.n.
Once her acute renal failure resolves , she may be transitioned
to Celebrex or other antiinflammatory medications which may be
more effected for her arthritis. ANA came back negative.
Psyche: She was continued on Celexa for depression.
Code status: Full code.
FOLLOWUP: The patient needs to follow up with the congestive
heart failure service as well as her primary care physician.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: PRESYNCOPE.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56 year old black female
with coronary artery disease ,
status post three myocardial infarctions and a coronary artery
bypass graft between the years of 1973 and 1984 , who now came into
the hospital with back pain and one episode of dizziness with a
racing heart. Her cardiac history begins in 1973 when she had her
first myocardial infarction. She has had two more in 1983 and in
1984. She had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1984 in which her
LIMA was placed to her LAD , and the saphenous vein graft placed to
her obtuse marginal and the diagonal branch. The coronary artery
bypass graft in 1984 was very successful , and she has been stable
since that time without angina or congestive heart failure
symptoms. She reports that she had a negative exercise tolerance
test one year ago , Holter two to three years ago was reportedly
normal also. The only time the patient recalls having a racing
heart prior to the day of admission was when her brother died two
years ago.
On the day of admission , the patient awoke with a dull ,
nonradiating pain between her shoulder blades that remained until
the patient was given 02 in the Emergency Ward which was
approximately 12 hours after awakening. The patient was never with
this pain before the day of admission. In additional , as the
patient was walking down the street near her home on the morning of
the day of admission , she felt herself stagger , and the world
seemed to rotate around her. She sat down for about 10 minutes
until the spell passed. During this episode , her back pain did not
change in quality or intensity. She had no chest pain , shortness
of breath , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , loss of consciousness ,
trauma , headache , neck stiffness , blurry vision , paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea , or orthopnea. She does report an accompanying
racing heart that seemed regular. After this episode , the patient
drove herself to the Georgeb.sonhan Hospital Emergency Ward
for evaluation.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient had menopause at 42 years of age.
She has never had a mammogram or regular breast exams. The rest of
her review of systems was noncontributory. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft
in 1984 as reported in the history of the present illness. She has
had hypertension for ten years. An echocardiogram in 3/27 showed
left ventricular enlargement , inferior apicokinesis , lateral
hypokinesis , and 1+ mitral regurgitation. ALLERGIES: To
Penicillin which leads to anaphylaxis. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Were only Isordil and Cardizem. The patient has a 15 pack-year
history of smoking. She quit two months ago. She does not drink
alcohol or abuse IV drugs. She lives alone and is unemployed as an
unemployed LPN , and has one child.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a well developed well nourished
black female very anxious and teary eyed.
Blood pressure on admission was 180/90 in the right arm and 180/95
in the left arm , pulses were equal at 72. She was afebrile at
98.7 , and respirations of 20. She was not orthostatic. The skin
was warm and dry. There were no rashes or bleeding. HEENT exam
was benign. The neck was supple , positive jugular venous
distention at about 10 cm , but no coronary artery bruits. The
lungs were clear. The back was without costovertebral angle
tenderness or spinal tenderness. Cardiovascular exam: Regular
rate and rhythm with an S3 and a palpable S4 , with a holosystolic
murmur at the apex and a systolic ejection murmur at the left lower
sternal border. No radiation of either murmur. Her PMI was
diffuse with a sternal heave. Abdominal exam was benign.
Extremities were benign. Pulses: Femoral on the left with a
bruit , and 2+ femoral on the right without a bruit , and 1+. The
rest of the pulses were 1-2+ bilaterally. No renal artery bruits
were heard. Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented ,
and her exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission showed a normal SMA-7. Her
hematocrit was 41.5 with a low MCV at 78.7 , low
MCH at 31.3 , and a RDW of 16.1. The patient ruled out for a
myocardial infarction with normal CK's. Her chest x-ray showed a
globular heart , question of some cardiomegaly , clearly post
coronary artery bypass graft with lots of clips. She had right
atrial enlargement with loss of the retrosternal air space , but no
evidence of aortic widening of the mediastinum. No pulmonary
edema , no pulmonary vascular redistribution was detected. EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with a PR interval of .14 , QRS
.11 , and a QT of .45. She had left atrial enlargement , old lateral
T-wave inversions as well as inferior T-wave inversions. The
patient had no acute changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Involved placing the patient on a cardiac
monitor , rule her out for an myocardial
infarction , obtaining exercise stress test , echocardiogram , drawing
blood for thyroid function tests , VMA's , metanephrines in the
urine. In addition , a beta blocker was added to her hypertensive
regimen , and she was started on an aspirin a day. Her cardiac
monitor demonstrated no dysrhythmias except for a few PVC's. The
results of the 24 hour Holter on discharge were still pending. She
ruled out for a myocardial infarction. An exercise stress test
showed that the patient went 5 minutes and 45 seconds on a standard
Bruce protocol , no ischemic symptoms , stopped due to leg pains.
EKG was with 1 mm upsloping ST depressions in V4 and V5. It was
reportedly consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Because
of this , the patient should probably have an exercise MIBI on the
outside as an outpatient. An echocardiogram demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 45-50% , severe hypokinesis of the
anterolateral and posterior wall , akinesis of the inferior wall ,
2-3+ mitral regurgitation , and an intra-atrial septal aneurysm , no
tumor or thrombus was detected.
Laboratory studies on admission did demonstrate an elevated protein
of 8.5 and a globulin fraction of 4.2. Therefore , an S-PEP , IgG
and IgM's were sent and were pending on discharge.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. ,
Cardizem 60 mg q.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , and an
Aspirin a day. The patient was discharged to home in very stable
condition and will followup in REUM WILSHIP MEMORIAL HOSPITAL on 8/28/93 at 1:30. A copy of
this discharge should be sent to Dr. Mccrane , telephone number
026-6050 , who is her primary medical doctor. During her stay here ,
we were not able to get hold of him and notify him of the patient's
status.

Discharge Date: 11/8/2005
ATTENDING: MEADERS , DONNY MD
CONSULTS: Consults for this patient included Urology and
Cardiology.
PROCEDURES: Procedures for this patient included a urological
procedure with placement of a ureteral stent and subsequent
removal of the ureteral stent.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications on admission included Lasix 20 mg
b.i.d. , OxyContin 90 b.i.d. and 40 q. 2 p.m. , lisinopril 40
daily , Norvasc 5 b.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 b.i.d. , Levoxyl 88 mcg ,
Ativan 0.5 at bedtime , Niferex 150 b.i.d. , Colace b.i.d. ,
lactulose 50 daily , Faslodex 250 IM q. month , Coumadin 5 daily ,
Zometa q. month , Fosamax 70 q. week , and exemestane 25 mg po
daily.
ALLERGIES: Her allergies included penicillin , which resulted in
pruritus and a rash.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 75-year-old woman with a
history of rheumatic heart disease , status post St. Jude's mitral
valve repair as well as AV and TV repair who has CHF at baseline
with an EF of 40% to 45% as well as metastatic breast cancer and
a recent history of hydronephrosis who initially presented with
chest discomfort with exertion that resolved with rest. The
chest pain started five days prior to admission , which is
described as a 7 or 8 out of 10 associated with nausea and
shortness of breath , but the patient denied any radiation of the
pain , any vomiting , or any diaphoresis. She also said that she
had PND and orthopnea at baseline and she had recently increased
her number of pillows that she sleeps on , from two to three. Her
weight had been stable with no change in diet. She ruled out for
an MI; however , given her hydronephrosis , thought to be secondary
to her metastatic cancer and her rise in creatinine , it was
decided to place a ureteral stent , which was done by the Urology
Service. However , after the stent was placed , she developed
severe pain , fever , and increased white blood cell count.
Although the fever and white blood cell count resolved , she
continued to feel pain , and it was decided to remove the ureteral
stent since it was not decreasing her creatinine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her admission physical exam was notable
for a blood pressure of 168/94. Other vitals included a
temperature 97.2 , pulse 69 , respiratory rate 16 , and saturating
98% on room air. Her JVP was 9. She had left lower lung
crackles , otherwise clear. She has a very loud ejection murmur ,
loud S1 and S2. She was in atrial fibrillation with a
irregularly irregular heart rate with no rub and she had a 1 to
2+ edema bilaterally and she was trace guaiac positive.
PROBLEM LIST BY SYSTEM:
Heart: Ischemia: She had a negative MIBI and her A and B sets
of troponins were negative , however her C set was 0.14 , which was
thought to be an error. Her aspirin and statin were continued.
Pump: Her EF was 35% to 40%. She was kept on hydralazine ,
Lasix , and beta-blocker , and her digoxin was stopped due to
bradycardia during this admission. In terms of her valves , she
has a St. Jude valve as well as other valve abnormalities and her
INR goal was 2 to 3. She was taken off her Coumadin for her
stent procedure and then bridged with heparin for a PTT goal of
60 to85. Her Coumadin was restarted and we waited until she was
therapeutic at an INR above 2 before she was discharged. Rate:
She is normally in atrial fibrillation. She developed
bradycardia for several days , which was though to be a
combination of some Lopressor given to her in ED when she was
having her rule out as well as slightly elevated levels of
digoxin. Her dioxin was stopped. Her beta-blocker was stopped
and then restarted at a lower dose. By discharge , she was
tolerating low-dose Lopressor. During the hospital stay , on
2/29/05 she had 10 beats of VT during which she was
asymptomatic. Her blood pressure was stable.
Renal: She had acute renal failure on admission and as I had
dictated previously she had a ureteral stent placed on 2/29/05
and that was then removed on 2/24/05 because of her severe pain.
Endocrine: She was kept on her Levoxyl.
Heme: She was guaiac positive , and her stools were guaiaced and
her hematocrit was monitored. Although it dropped initially , it
did not drop further during the hospital stay. She was kept on
her home pain control medications and she required additional
pain medications when she had her stent placed.
Psych: She continued her home medications.
GI: She stayed on her lactulose and Colace and bowel regimen was
titrated to bout BM's.
DISPOSITION: She was stable on the day of discharge. She was
discharged to home , I believe , with VNA.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her medications on the day of discharge
were Coumadin 6 q.p.m. , hydralazine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 20
in the morning and 40 at night , Lopressor 12.5 t.i.d. , Aranesp
100 subcutaneous q. week , OxyContin 90 q. 12h. and 40 q. 2.p.m. ,
Nexium 40 daily , Zocor 20 mg at bedtime , aspirin 81 , Colace 100 ,
Niferex 150 , Levoxyl 88 , Senna daily , and exemestane 25 mg po
daily.
FOLLOWUP: She was instructed to follow up with her PCP.

VQ: Low probability
LABS: Creatinine of 2.2 that dropped to 1.5 with hydration ( BL
1.2-1.3 ). HCT 41.6 with drop after aggresive hydration. Lipase of 132
but has chronic pancreatitis and is now normalizing. UA and ACE
negative.
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 66 YO male with complicated PMH admitted with
hyperglycemia likely due to non-compliance and hypotension likely due
to hypovolemia. In ED the patient received 5 liters of IVF and 36U of
insulin. His blood pressure stabilized with volume and he was
transfered to the medical floor.
ENDOCRINE - DMII but with history of pancreatitis so behaves more like
type 1 - needs insulin all the time. Per patient he had been taking 20
units of Lantus QAM but patient admitted to poor compliance with both
diet and insulin. His A1C was checked and returned at 19. The patient
was started on Lantus and Lispro and maintained on an ADA diet. He was
titrated to 20 units of Lantus QHS and was requring Lispro for FS
ranging from 120-600. By 8/22 his FS remained better controlled but
were still high ranging from 200 to 400 on Lantus 16. On 3/22 the
patient expressed that he would like to leave. He is discharged o
n Lantus 20 and Lispro SS with VNA to follow finger sticks. He
was maintained on an ADA diet , however , there was some concern he
may have been eating sweets on his own. Nutrition was consulted
and provided teaching regaring diet and diabetes. The patient is
discharged to home on Lantus and lispro with VNA following
HEME - on coumadin for hx of pacer clot. Echo shows pacer clot but
not clear whether patient will be compliant enough to go home on
coumadin as he has not been in the past. After discussion with
patient agreement is that we will d/c on coumadin 5 QD ( INR on
day of d/c 1.2 ) with enough supply for one week. He will have
blood drawn by VNA with results sent to Dr. Zarkin If he his not
compliant with his lab work the coumadin will be stopped.
CV -
ISCHEMIA: Nonobstuctive CAD on cath in September with no evidence
of acute episode. Maintained on ASA , ACEi , and Statin. No BB as
current cocaine user and considered to dangerous
PUMP: EF: 20-25% Hypovolemic at admission with good response to
hydration. No episodes of volume overload. On ACEi for AL reduction.
RHYTHM: CHB with PPM in place
GI: elevated lipase with chronic pancreatitis with no symptoms and
resolution after hydration.
DISPO: The patient is discharged to home in fair condition. He has been
given teaching regarding nutrition , diabetes , and coumadin. His
medications has been discussed with him. He agrees to be compliant with
all medications , to work with VNA , and to attend all of his
appointments and blood draws. He is discharged home on coumadin and
Lantus to be followed by VNA. He is to follow up with Dr. Harnage within
the next week and will be contacted with an appointment

Discharge Date: 4/4/2005
ATTENDING: BOGGIANO , COLUMBUS WILTON MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Ventricular fibrillation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Forbess is a 75-year-old man
with ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% status post ICD
and biventricular pacer , moderate aortic stenosis who was
admitted on July , 2005 after his ICD fired at home for
ventricular fibrillation. He notes a productive cough , a
subjective fever and nausea and vomiting at home. He was
subsequently seen in Electrophysiology Clinic. He had a low
grade fever of 100.0 at that time. He was electively admitted
but on the way to the floor , his ICD fired again. He was given
lidocaine and after a third firing of his ICD , he was begun on
amiodarone. The patient then became short of breath and was in
pulmonary edema , requiring intubation. Chest x-ray showed a
right upper lobe white out. The patient was taken to Cath for
possible ischemia contributing to his ventricular fibrillation.
He had a proximal 80% LAD lesion and a mid 70% LAD lesion which
were both stented with Seifer stents. He also had a 60% D1
lesion which was angioplastied to a residual 40% lesion. He also
had a 70% left circumflex lesion. After catheterization , the
patient was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. He was
continued on his amiodarone load. He had no further arrhythmias
during his ICU stay. He was extubated the following day and was
diuresed for congestive heart failure. He also began treatment
for both community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia.
He was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on May ,
2005.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , EF of 15% , status
post ICD and biventricular pacer , moderate aortic stenosis ,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , diabetes , chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , and
hypothyroidism.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Synthroid.
2. Lasix.
3. Coumadin.
4. Lopressor.
5. Lorazepam.
6. Colace.
7. Prilosec.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon transfer out of the Intensive Care
Unit , the patient was afebrile with a pulse of 81 , blood pressure
108/74 , oxygen saturation of 84% on room air , and 97% on four
liters. JVP of 14 cm. Lungs with bibasilar rales. Cardiac exam
revealed a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen was soft with a
pulsatile liver and mild right lower quadrant tenderness with no
rebound or guarding. His extremities had trace pitting edema.
Examination of his skin revealed vesicles at the sternum above
the nipple line with a papular rash extending in a dermatomal
pattern around to the right side of the back to the midline as
well as extension down the inner portion of his upper arm.
LABS: Labs were significant for a creatinine of 2.1 , and a
negative troponin on the day of admission.
IMPRESSION: 75-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy
admitted with ventricular fibrillation of unclear etiology ,
though possibilities include underlying infection or cardiac
ischemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was taken to the Cath Lab and
had stents placed in the LAD with other residual disease
remaining. The patient was continued on a regimen of aspirin ,
Plavix and a statin. The patient often refused to take the
statin , though this was recommended. He was also started on a
low dose of ace inhibitor which the patient frequently refused as
well. We would recommend starting a beta-blocker when the
patient is more stable. The patient continued to be diuresed
with Lasix until he was uvolemic and then resumed his home dose
of Lasix 80 mg daily. An echo during admission showed an EF of
15% with moderate aortic stenosis. For his episodes of
ventricular fibrillation , the patient was begun on an amiodarone
load with a goal of a total of 10 grams at which point he should
be tapered to 40 mg per day. He has one day remaining of his
amiodarone load and should begin the 400 mg per day dose on September , 2005. He was monitored on telemetry without significant
event. The patient should follow up with Dr. Kolopajlo in
Electrophysiology Clinic.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient was treated for both
community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia with
cefotaxime , azithromycin and Flagyl. The patient completed a
5-day course of azithromycin. He is still in the process of
completing a total 10 day course of cephalosporin and Flagyl. He
has one more day of therapy remaining. The patient was also
noted to have shingles. The patient reports experiencing pain
that started on his back before the rash appeared. The rash was
present prior to admission. He was started on acyclovir on May , 2005 and this was stopped on November , 2005 given that there
was likely little utility of treatment begun greater than 48
hours into the course and because the patient preferred not to
take the medication.
3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of 1.5. Creatinine was initially elevated to
2.1 , but improved back to baseline prior to discharge.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes , but was on
no medications as an outpatient. He received a diabetic diet and
was treated with a regular insulin sliding scale during
admission. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 , indicating poor glycemic
control. He was started on a low dose of glipizide and the
regular insulin sliding scale was discontinued. The patient also
has a history of hypothyroidism. TSH was checked and was 1.6 ,
which is within normal limits. The patient was also noted to
have a low calcium level and was found to be vitamin D deficient.
We have started supplementation of vitamin D.
5. Heme: The patient is anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation
and low ejection fraction. The patient's Coumadin was initially
held but then restarted on October , 2005. He is now
therapeutic. Goal INR is 2-3. He will need to be monitored and
Coumadin adjusted as needed. The patient also has iron
deficiency anemia. He will need GI evaluation in the future. He
was begun on iron supplementation , however , the patient
frequently refuses to take this medication.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient is therapeutic on Coumadin.
7. Code status: The patient is full code.
FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Blood draw in 2-3 days to monitor INR and creatinine. Please
adjust Coumadin dose for a goal INR of 2-3.
2. Taper amiodarone to 40 mg daily on September , 2005 from the
loading dose of 400 mg t.i.d.
3. Please encourage the patient to take simvastatin , captopril
and iron supplements. The patient frequently refuses to take
these recommended medications.
4. Last day of antibiotics is March , 2005.
5. The patient will need GI evaluation for his iron deficiency
anemia.

Impression: demand related ischemia 2/2 hypoglycemia
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient had no recurrence of chest pain once she arrived on the
floor , or for that matter , SOB/N/V. She initally had difficulty
maintaining her blood sugars and was given another amp of d50 and
orange juice on the floor. After the first 12 hours , her blood sugars
have been consistently over 120. Although she was very enzyme posive
for NSTEMI ( MB 31.2-->32.4-->15.4 today ) , chest pain did not recur. IN
fact , her EKG has been normal since arriving on the floor. Therefore ,
her episode of ischemia was thought to be demand related ischemia in
the context of hypoglycemia. Causes of the hypoglycemia included hypoth
yroidism , adrenal insufficiency , and iatrogenesis. Given the finite
duration of the hypoglycemia , the latter possibility was deemed most
likely ( TSH , AM cortisol wnl ). The patient's cardiac enzymes have
peaked ( MB: 31.2-->31.4--> 15.4 ). The patient's home situation has been
previouisly known to be suboptimal--she had a son who may have been
dealing drugs in her home 2 years ago. This time , there was concern
over potential tension betwee her and her estranged husband or
medication errors. Social work was called and spoke with the daughter.
She appears to be appropriately concerned about her mother's health
and open to the idea of placement in an assisted living facility at
some later date. It is clear that an elaborate and effective system has
been worked out to monitor and treat the patient's blood sugars. The
patients visiting nurse service ( Lan Xiemore Medical Center ) was contacted to reemphasize
the importance of evaluating the patient's medication regimen. The
nurse involved in the patient's care also will initiate a request
for a home health aide to visit the patient more frequently. Elder
services was informed to initiate a consult. The social worker at
Centter Ing Community Hospital was also informed of this admission. The
patient's home situation is deemed safe for discharge. She will
follow up with Dr. Fowlie on November VNA will visit her
tommorrow. The patient's hematocrit dropped slightly the day of dischar
ge. However , the patient was guaiac negative. Parenthetically , the
patient had a slightly dirty UA on admission. She was initially treated
but given her lack of symptoms , this was discontinued.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your insulin dosage has been decreased because your blood sugar was too
low. Your visiting nurse should check your blood sugars and call your
physician if they are consistently above 150. Your dose of lipitor has
been increased because your LDL on this admission was 92.

metastatic BCA s/p 3 cycles taxol , one year herceptin , h/o DM , HTN
who p/w acute onset SOB following chemo this AM. Pt was recently
admitted for new-onset CM 1/19/05. One month prior , after
beginning taxol therapy , pt began to have increased SOB and fatigue
w/ no CP , orthopnea , LE swelling ( some cough lying down ). A chest CT
performed on 10/10 showed interval progression of CHF. At time ,
she was started on LAsix but did not fill the presciption till 4/29
An echo at Greepe Community Hospital showed an EF of 15% w/ LV thrombus , and PT
admitted to KMC . She was treated w/anticoagulation ( bridged to
coumadin ) , Had negative Adenosine-MIBI for ischemia ( though non
diagnostic ) and negative labs for CM. She was d/c following diuresis
in good condtion , stating she could walk 1/2 mile w/out SOB , PND ,
orthopnea , cough , F/C. In this state , pt had chemotherapty this AM.

*****
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 86F with hx CHF , Afib , CKD , and diabetes who
was admitted with partial SBO , bilateral aspiration pneumonia , and CHF
exacerbation.
-
GI: Admitted with partial SBO. She was treated wtih conservative
management. No NGT was required. The SBO resolved and she was passing
stool and tolerating a normal diet.
-
CV: She has a history of diastolic dysfunction. Echo 8/27 with EF 45-50% ,
no RWMA , mod LAE and RAE , bioprosthetic MV w/ tr MR , tr AR , severe TR ,
mild-mod PR. She reported SOB prior to admission which ws thought to be
due to a CHF exacerbation. She was not agressively diuresed in the
setting of the partial SBO. She is on variable doses of lasix
( 80-200mg po bid ) at home. She was initially given lasix 80mg bid which
required additional doses of lasix iv prn to diurese , so the dose was
increased to 160mg po bid. Repeat CXR on 3/17 looks a little better than
admission. Overall her SOB and hypoxia improved. She no longer required
supplemental oxygen. She has a history of hypertension and was continued
on norvasc and imdur. She also has a history of Afib , now on coumadin.
Her rate was adequately controlled. The coumadin was initially held due
to possible procedures related to the SBO. The INR remained in 2-3 range ,
likely due to the antibiotics. The Coumadin was restarted on 10/20 as the
INR was trending down , and was started at lower dose ( 2mg instead of 3mg )
given the antibiotics. Her INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted as
an outpatient.
-
Pulmonary: She has a history of aspiration PNA. The Abd CT showed
bilateral lower lobe PNA , likely aspiration. She was treated with levo
and flagyl. Her WBC was elevated on admission and decreased during
hospitalization. She was afebrile. With treatment of the pneumonia and
CHF she was no longer hypoxic or SOB. She will continue levofloxacin and
flagyl for an 8-day course.
-
Renal: She has a history of CKD with Cr baseline of 2.6-2.8. Her Cr was
2.6 on admission and 2.3 on discharge. She continued home sevelamer.
-
Diabetes: Her insulin was initially held on admission due to NPO for the
SBO. When her SBO resolved and she was eating again , her home regimen of
lantus 100 units daily , Novolog 5 units qac , and Novolog sliding scale
was restarted. Her fingersticks continued to be high , perhaps due to
pneumonia. The insulin was titrated up for better glucose control to
Lantus 12 units daily , Novolog 7 units qac , and Novolog sliding scale.
The daughter is a nurse and will monitor and adjust her insulin at home.
HbA1c 8.2.
-
ID: Treatment for aspiration pneumonia as above with levofloxacin and
flagyl. Ucx with mixed flora.
-
Heme: Hct at baseline. As above , her INR remained high off coumadin ,
likely due to the antibiotics. Coumadin restarted on 10/20 at a lower
dose. INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted as an outpatient
-
Nutrition: She had a radiologic swallowing evaluation which showed deep
laryngeal penetration with thin and nectar-thick liquid with no
aspiration and a tiny Zenker diverticulum. Diet recommendations were
ground diet ( for lack of teech ) and thin liquids.
-
Disposition: PT recommended rehab. Patient and daughter prefer patient to
go home w/ services. The daughter is a nurse. New PCP is Dr. Hermes
( geriatrics ) at 12/10 at 2pm at
Mawe Tesparks In Hospital .

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Pneumonia: She will be discharged on levofloxacin and flagyl to treat
her pneumonia to complete an 8-day course , which will end on 6/20
2. CHF: She will continue to take the lasix.
3. Hypertension: She should continue to take her previous medications.
4. Diabetes: Her insulin has been increased during hospitalization.
Continue to monitor the glucose levels and adjusting her insulin.
5. Coumadin: Her coumadin was restarted on 10/20 at 2pm ( lower dose than
prior due to the effect of antibiotics increasing the INR ). However , her
INR has been low at 1.5 and 1.4 , so the coumadin has been increased to
3mg at discharge. Continue to monitor her INR and adjust her coumadin as
needed.
6. Continue home PT as recommended.
7. Seek medical attention if she develops fever , chills , shortness of
breath , chest pain , worsening cough , or any other concerning symptoms.
8. The patient has an appointment with a new PCP , Dr. Lamar of the Dept
of Geriatrics , on 7/10/07 at Orvo Glumflu Carn Hospital .
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Pneumonia: Patient will complete an 8-day course of levo and flagyl.
Monitor for resolution of pneumonia.
2. CHF: Patient will continue lasix. Continue to monitor volume status.
3. Afib: Patient will continue coumadin , will be monitored and adjusted
by Coumadin Clinic.
4. Diabetes: Patient will continue insulin regimen at home.
5. PCP: Patient will have a new PCP , Dr. Rowling , who she will see on 10/8

presented with orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion for three days.
She recently presented with CHF/bronchospasm syndrome in 1996 that
was ultimately ascribed to mitral regurgitation and thought
secondary to rheumatic heart disease. Her symptoms resolved after
St. Jude's mitral valve replacement in 2/10 She has been in her
usual state of health until approximately one week before
admission , when she contracted a flu-like illness with fever , cough
productive of yellow sputum , headache , and diffuse myalgias ,
postnasal discharge. She was prescribed amoxicillin by her primary
care provider with minimal relief. Approximately three days before
admission she noted increasing shortness of breath when lying flat
accompanied by cough and wheezing. She has also had dyspnea on
exertion such as while doing laundry. She denies chest pain ,
except some soreness at her CABG scar whenever she coughs. She
denies light-headedness or palpitations. She does describe
increasing lower extremity edema compared to her baseline. She has
no calf tenderness. She denies significant dietary indiscretion or
medical noncompliance.

A/P:
82 yo RHM with h/o HTN , DM-2 , CAD and AVR ( on coumadin until 9/22 )
was last seen normal when went to nap this afternoon at 12:45pm. At
2:30pm woke up dysarthric , mild RUE weakness. His wife noticed slowing
and confusion. Head CT at BMC ( repeated here ) showed small left BG bleed ,
extending to left lateral ( occipital horn ). Given location , most likely
hypertensive bleed. Cannot rule out underlying small stroke. Given h/o
AVR will r/o endocarditis as well. Plan
1. admit to NICU. When transfer to the floor TAGH
2. BP control with home regimen. keep SBP<140
3. Hold ASA. Continue holding coumadin , clarify indication in
the future
4. Hold metformin for now ( in case needs CT/A ) , add insulin
sliding scale
Brief Hospital Course:
The hemorrhage was stable on follow-up imaging. INR was 1.1.
Neurologic exam was stable , with persistent dysarthria , right pronator
drift , and mild right leg weakness. Patient evaluated by PT/OT and
deemed appropriate candidate for acute rehab.
Cardiovascular: Continued to be in atrial fibrillation. Pacemaker was
firing , but on 5/25 pm had an episode of hr 30's x few seconds , and for
rest of night hr 40's - 50's. EKG unchanged from admission - atrial
fibrillation , left anterior fascicular block , some pvc's. Consulted
PH Cardiology , who analyzed the telemetry and found that bradycardic
readings were artifactual. There was no EKG obtained during bradycardia
and no documented physical exam findings to suggest bradycardia.
Cardiology felt there was no other evidence of pacer malfunction.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: RABAL , LONNIE M.D.
INTERIM DICTATION THROUGH September , 2006
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 69-year-old woman
with diabetes , hypertension , congestive heart failure ,
rheumatologic overlap syndrome with rheumatoid
arthritis/dermatomyositis , who was admitted for chest wall pain.
Of note , two weeks prior to admission , the patient reports a fall
during which she hit her chest on the floor. Upon admission , the
reasons for the patient's chest pain were unclear. Her cardiac
enzymes were negative and her EKG was unchanged. Chest x-ray was
negative for infiltrate. However , soon after the patient was
admitted to the floor she had high fevers and grew out
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from her blood.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Dermatomyositis diagnosed in 2006.
2. Insulin-dependent diabetes complicated by neuropathy.
3. Hypertension.
4. History of Graves' disease status post radiotherapy.
5. Rheumatoid arthritis/rheumatologic overlap syndrome.
6. Status post SBO.
7. B12 deficiency.
8. Idiopathic cardiomyopathy ( ejection fraction 45% ).
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , aspirin , codeine , Zocor.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone in Ent Saint She
has a home VNA two times per week. She is a former smoker , but
denies IV drug use and ethanol use.
STUDIES:
1. Transthoracic echocardiogram performed on March , 2006
revealed a left ventricle normal in size. Estimated ejection
fraction was 55% ( previous echocardiograms had showed an ejection
fraction of 45% ). There were no regional wall motion
abnormalities. There was no significant pericardial effusion.
No vegetations were seen.
2. Transesophageal echocardiogram performed on May , 2006
revealed a normal left ventricular wall thickness with no
regional wall motion abnormalities , trace mitral regurgitation
was seen. There was no evidence of valvular vegetations or
abscesses.
3. A CT scan of the chest without contrast on August , 2006 showed
a slight soft tissue prominence at the costosternal joint , but no
abscess and no bone destruction was seen. There was no drainable
fluid collection or bone destruction seen on the scan. MRI on
May , 2006 revealed a linear low signal within the sternum
suspicious for a fracture with adjacent rim-enhancing collection
extending both anterior and posterior to the sternum , suspicious
for an abscess. Hematoma is also possible.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient had a negative rule out
myocardial infarction protocol. She was maintained on her
antihypertensive medications during her hospitalization and she
was hemodynamically well controlled. Because the patient had
MRSA bacteremia upon admission and because the patient had
elevated ESR and CRP , endocarditis was entertained as a possible
diagnosis. TTE and TEE , however , showed no vegetations on the
patient's valves. The patient's CRP on May , 2006 was 135 , the
patient's ESR on November , 2006 was 90.
2. Infectious disease: The patient had fevers upon admission to
greater than 101. Initial blood cultures revealed four of four
bottles to be MRSA bacteremia. Despite treatment with
vancomycin , the patient also had positive blood cultures on August , 2006. At the time of this dictation , the patient had negative
blood cultures from September , 2006 through March , 2006. She had a
bandemia to 6 on admission. It was not obvious initially what
the source was of the patient's MRSA bacteremia. Given her
elevated ESR and CRP , endocarditis was entertained as a
diagnosis. However , both TTE and TEE showed no evidence of
vegetations on the valves. The patient had a soft tissue
prominence on examination over her sternal manubrial joint on the
right side of her sternum. The original CT scan showed a soft
tissue prominence but no fluid collection. However , MRI on May , 2006 showed evidence of an abscess or hematoma in the right
subpectoral region. The patient had a CT-guided aspiration
performed on February , 2006 and 15 mL of pus was removed. The
drain was left in place. Studies from this fluid were pending at
the time of this dictation. However , the Thoracic Surgery
Service was consulted for possible debridement of the wound.
Infectious disease service was also consulted concerning the
timing for the placement of the PICC line , as well as the
duration of the patient's vancomycin.
3. Musculoskeletal: Chest x-ray showed evidence of an old left
shoulder fracture.
4. Rheumatology: The patient was maintained on prednisone for
dermatomyositis.
5. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on her home dose of
NPH. On this dose , the patient's blood sugars were well
controlled. The patient's TSH was measured A6 at 5.129 with a T4
of 7.2 and a THBR of 1.27. The patient's dose of Synthroid was
not altered.
6. Hematology: The patient was anemic on admission with
hematocrits ranging from 24-29. B12 level on November , 2006 was
199. She was given supplementation , both orally and IM , and on
November , 2006 her B12 level was 842. She was also found to have
both iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. Iron
studies from September , 2006 revealed an iron less than assay , a TIBC
of 202 , and ferritin 182. The patient was started on oral iron
supplementation during her hospitalization.
7. Skin: The patient was noted to have excoriations and open
lesions on her legs , which were likely due to itching. The
patient was given Bactroban. All of these excoriations were
clean , dry and intact. There was no evidence of infection.
9. Neurologic: The patient was maintained on amitriptyline and
Neurontin during her hospital stay.
10. Renal: On November , 2006 , the patient had a creatinine to
1.7. It is the feeling of the team that this is due to
gentamicin toxicity. At one point during the patient's
hospitalization , gentamicin had been added for synergistic effect
with vancomycin. Gentamicin had been added as the patient was
continuing to spike fevers despite vancomycin treatment. When
the patient's creatinine began to rise , gentamicin was
discontinued. Creatinine will likely resolve with time without
gentamicin administration in the future.
A component of the arf was due to repeated gadolidium exposure from repeat
mri of sternum and a hemodynamic with worsening when acei reinitiated.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: March , 2006: In general , the patient is
fatigued and somnolent. At multiple times during the patient's
hospitalization , she became difficult to arouse. Upon touching
her sternum , however , the patient opened her eyes and was alert
and oriented. This seems to be her baseline behavior. There was
no lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular exam revealed regular rate
and rhythm , normal S1 , S2. No murmurs , rubs or gallops. The
patient had bilateral anterior chest wall pain to mild palpation
at the T3 level. Overlying the skin there was no erythema or
warmth. However , there was a fluctuant mass underneath the skin
surface. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally , but she had shallow respirations due to pain on deep
breaths. Her abdominal exam was soft and nontender. Examination
of her extremities revealed multiple excoriations that were
clean , dry , and intact. Although the patient was somnolent at
times and difficult to arouse , she was alert and oriented x3 and
her neurologic exam was nonfocal. It appears that the patient's
excessive tiredness and excessive sleeping is her baseline
behavior. When the patient needed to be awake and oriented to
perform certain tasks , such as getting an MRI , she was able to do
so. Moreover , when she was witnessed interacting with her son ,
she was more alert.
CODE STATUS: Full code.
CONSULTS:
1. Infectious disease ( Mickey Vesley , Infectious Disease fellow ).
2. Thoracic surgery.
Dr. Burt Eldridge Conedy will dictate the remainder of the patient's
hospital course , including his disposition and discharge
medications.

Discharge Date: 6/10/2005
ATTENDING: IWANEJKO , COLLIN M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: Anaphylaxis.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypothyroidism.
4. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
5. Polymyalgia rheumatica.
6. Diabetic retinopathy.
7. Urinary tract infection.
8. Adrenal insufficiency.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 86-year-old female
with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica for which she takes
steroids and has developed adrenal insufficiency. She presented
to the emergency room with shortness of breath , wheezing , and a
maculopapular rash after receiving the pneumovax shot. She
received this shot upon discharge from admission to the Baybell Lolic Hospital for syncope and dehydration. The treatment there
was IV fluids in short course and increase in her steroids. In
the emergency room , she was treated with steroids , Benadryl , and
Pepcid.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Immunology: The patient was found to have anaphylactic
reaction to the Pneumovax shot that she received. Her
symptoms resolved by hospital day #1 after receiving IV Benadryl
around the clock , Pepcid , and an increased dose in her Hydrocort
to 100 mg IV q.6h. The steroids were started on a taper and on
the night of the first admission , the patient was noted to have increased
shortness of breath and
oxygen requirements. She was treated with oxygen and increased
steroids again for presumed reexacerbation of anaphylaxis.
2. Pulmonary: The episode of wheezing that she had on the first
day of admission could also be partly explained by fluid
overload. By hospital day #2 , she had developed crackles and
jugular venous distention. She has a history of diastolic heart
dysfunction , and diuresis was initiated. Despite receiving 3
doses of IV Lasix , she had an episode of flash pulmonary edema on the
second night of hospitalization. A chest x-ray was obtained at
that time which was consistent with pulmonary edema. She was
stabilized with additional Lasix and 100% nonrebreather mask , and
nitroglycerin. Her blood pressure was 200 systolic at that time.
The plan for continued diuresis was interrupted on hospital day
#3 when she became hypotensive and febrile with a UA consistent with infection.
She was started on Levo for presumed urosepsis.
On hospital day #4 , diuresis was resumed as her blood pressure
stabilized around 110 , and she still had a 5-6L oxygen requirement. The
patient reports her dry weight is 140 to 143 lbs. Her
primary care doctor suspects it more like 149 lbs. She is
currently receiving diuresis to wean oxygen requirement and is
down to 1 L per nasal cannula. Her goal fluid status is to
negative 1 L per day , and she continues to receive Lasix IV to
meet that goal.
She was also restarted on p.o. Lasix 30 mg p.o. daily. There
was some concern about aspiration by the nursing staff. She
immediately had trouble with swallowing liquids and Speech and
Swallow was consulted. The patient failed the bedside swallow
exam and so a video swallow was obtained , which actually showed
no evidence of aspiration , and so she was continued on a regular
diet. By the time of discharge she did not require any oxygen. She would
intermittently desat to the high 80s , which would quickly resolve with deep
breathing or chest PT.
3. Endocrinology. The patient has a history of PMR and adrenal
insufficiency , on 30 mg of Hydrocort daily at home. On the
May , 2005 , in the setting of urosepsis she was placed back on stress
dose steroids which was then tapered back to her home dose throughout the
rest of her hospitalization. She has a history of
diabetes type 2 requiring insulin inhouse or oral agents. Oral
agents were held and insulin was given for glucose control , NPH
30 units in the morning and 10 units in the evening seemed to
control the a.m. and p.m. sugars pretty well. Regular insulin
was added 6 units in the morning with breakfast with the morning
NPH for 1 p.m. blood sugar control , as this was the highest blood
sugar daily. Obviously , this needs to be monitored and adjusted
as needed as well the medicine staff is going to be following her
as to whether she should resume the oral agents. She does on
occasion drop her blood sugar to 50 or 60 , which is usually
asymptomatic.
4. Renal: Her baseline creatinine was 1.0. Both her BUN and
creatinine were elevated with diuresis. Her creatinine needs to
be monitored closely and medications need to renally dosed.
5. Infectious Disease: Her urine was positive for greater than
100 , 000 group B hemolytic Streptococci and she was initially
started with Levaquin. It was switched to penicillin on January , 2005 , after the gram-positive organism was discovered and she
was switched back to Levaquin after the sensitivities came back ,
and it was sensitive to Levaquin. The Levaquin is ideal because
her coughing could also represent bronchitis. She has complained
of a cough since weeks before admission , which is now resolving.
6. Disposition: The patient does not feel that she can care for
herself at home and screening was placed to Er Medical Center , and that was accepted for the acute care center
for Saturday , March , 2005.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is just to follow up with
primary care physician. She should also follow up with Dr.
Wann from Pulmonary at the Reddis Hospital University Of An
appointment will be made for her. She should return to the
emergency room if she experiences chest pain , further shortness
of breath , severe sweating , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , or
other concerns.
LABORATORY DATA: On discharge , glucose 116 , BUN 30 , creatinine
1.3 , sodium 139 , potassium 3.4; please make a note that her
potassium requires repletion and should be monitored; chloride
93 , CO2 33 , CK 34 , calcium 8.7 , magnesium 1.8 , troponin less than

8. History of alcohol abuse.
9. History of seizure disorder.
10. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Mauras is a 72-year-old man with
history of CAD status post CABG , PCI with history of stable
angina , type 2 diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , former
smoking history and also history of seizure disorder with
cataracts and recently discharged after an admission for atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He had occasional
anginal symptoms prior to discharge. He took about two
nitroglycerins per week. Over the past week , he had escalating
chest pain requiring one nitroglycerin per day. The pain was
relieved by rest and nitroglycerin. One week prior to admission ,
his digoxin was stopped and his amiodarone was decreased. His
Plavix was stopped and his Coumadin was held. On the morning of
admission , he had chest pain. He had two nitroglycerins and
rested but the pain persisted. He was taken to the ED. In the
ED , he received Lopressor , Enalapril , Lovenox treatment dose and
a Plavix load.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes CAD , hypertension , CHF , diabetes ,
hypercholesterolemia , peripheral vascular disease and past
smoking history.
ALLERGIES: To penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for past alcohol and smoking
history. He quit alcohol 25 years ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Significant for afebrile , heart rate 45
and blood pressure 95/50. He had a left surgical pupil , left eye
ptosis at baseline. His heart had no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear. His abdomen was soft , nontender and
nondistended. He had bilateral femoral bruits , 2+ distal pulses.
No pronator drift.
LABS: Significant for hematocrit baseline at 30 to 32 , white
count of 13. His troponin peaked at 6.4.
EKG showed ST depressions in V3 through V6 that were new.
Echocardiogram on 3/23/05 showed an EF of 25 to 30% with septal
akinesis lateral and posterior hypokinesis and mild tricuspid
regurgitation.
Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospital course for this 72-year-old man with
non-ST-elevation MI.
1. Cardiovascular: A catheterization on hospital day 1 showed
four-vessel disease. No intervention was taken at that point , as
it was unclear which region was the culprit. Afterwards , he was
in hypotensive respiratory distress , likely secondary to flash
pulmonary edema. He received Lasix and morphine and he was
started on a nitro drip with improvement in symptoms. He was
found to have flash pulmonary edema and in atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response. He was taken back to the
catheterization lab and given four stents to his saphenous vein
graft , OM1 with good resolution of his symptoms and he went to
the CCU afterwards. On hospital day 3 , he was transferred to the
floor and was given an amiodarone load given his ejection
fraction and increased ectopy on telemetry. His troponin had
been trended down to the 0.2s by discharge. His beta-blocker and
ACE inhibitor were titrated to heart rate and blood pressure.
Prior to anticipated discharge , he re-developed flash pulmonary
edema secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Electrophysiology consult evaluated him and based on
his prior ejection fraction symptoms , it was decided to place a
dual-chamber pacemaker with AICD. He has had no respiratory
events since that placement. He has remained in atrial
fibrillation and was re-loaded with digoxin. He was started on
his Coumadin two days prior to discharge and was not yet
therapeutic. His repeat echo did show an EF of 55%. This was
after the pacemaker was placed.
2. Renal: He has chronic renal insufficiency. He was given
Mucomyst precath with good effect. His creatinine on discharge
was 1.1 and he was making urine.
3. GU: He has had some symptoms of urinary retention with
difficult-to-place Foley. He was started on Flomax with good
effect. His prostate was not overtly large on exam. His PSA was
within normal limits.
4. Endocrine: He is a type 2 diabetic. His home dose of
metformin was held. He was continued on Lantus with sliding
scale insulin.
5. Hematology: His hematocrit was transiently down to 24. When
transferred out of the CCU , he was given three units of packed
red blood cells given his history of CAD. Since this , his
hematocrit has been stable in the 30-to-32 range. An abdominal
CT did not show any evidence of retroperitoneal bleed. His groin
had only a very small hematoma. His stool guaiac was only trace
positive.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged home in stable condition with VNA
services. He will follow up with his PCP on 10/19/05 , with Dr.
Wicinsky on 1/14/05 , and he should have his INR checked on
3/5/05 or 1/14/05 and Coumadin adjusted accordingly.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: His physical exam on
discharge was largely unchanged , afebrile and hemodynamically
stable. He had now a pacemaker placed over the left chest.
Incision looked clean , slightly tender to palpation. He had no
murmurs or rubs , no pedal edema. His chest was clear.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest and epigastric pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76 year old woman who
is having a significant amount of GI
distress with belching and gas over several months to years who
presents with three hours of upper abdominal and chest discomfort
which she described after a fall day of volunteering and doing her
exercise. Actually she was sitting down to eat and then developed
this symptom that lasted for about three hours. The patient did
not that she has run out of her Atenolol for more than three days
prior to admission and came to the Emergency Room when her pain did
not resolve after taking some Tums and some water. The patient
denies any previous history of angina. She came into the Emergency
Room and had a blood pressure of 190/97 with a normal EKG. The
patient was given 5 mg of Lopressor and started back on her
Atenolol with decrease of her heart rate and blood pressure and
resolution of her symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesteremia.
ALLERGIES: Streptomycin.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d.
2. Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
3. Aspirin 325 mg q d.
4. Niacin 250 mg b.i.d.
5. Colace.
6. Multivitamin.
7. NPH insulin 20 units q a.m.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in a senior's home. She does
not smoke or drink alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: She was afebrile. Blood
pressure 150/90 , heart rate 84. O2
saturation was 94-97% on room air. GENERAL: The patient was a
pleasant obese woman in no acute distress , belching during her
history. NECK: Supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation except for
some initial left basilar crackles , which have cleared. HEART:
Regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs , gallops or rubs.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender. RECTAL: Heme negative , per
examination in the Emergency Room. EXTREMITIES: She did have some
bilateral trace edema. NEUROLOGIC: Non-focal.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: SMA-7 was significant for a glucose 236. CPK
was 74 , troponin 0.04. CBC and coags were
normal. Chest x-ray did show a top normal cardiac silhouette with
mild evidence of CHF. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no acute
ST or T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Short Stay Unit.
She was put on cardiac telemetry and was ruled
out for myocardial infarction with serial CPKs and EKGs. She had
no further episodes of her discomfort but did have continued
belching. On further discussion with the patient , she was actually
a relatively active woman who did not have any anginal symptoms in
the past and never described any shortness of breath , PND or
orthopnea. The plan was made to get an echocardiogram and do an
adenosine stress test. Her adenosine stress test was negative for
chest pain or EKG changes and her MIBI was negative for fixed
reversible defects. She therefore was felt to be negative for
ischemia. However , on her MIBI and her echocardiogram she did have
a mildly decreased LV function of 40-45% , of unknown significance
and unknown etiology. It was felt that this could be further
worked up for other causes , including sending out for TSH , SPEP ,
UPEP , and iron studies as an outpatient , as the patient was anxious
to leave the hospital. This could be done in clinic by her primary
care physician.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on her admission
medications with the addition of Axid 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and simethicone 80 q.i.d. p.r.n. for her gas. The patient
will discuss her GI symptoms with her primary care physician and
would benefit from further workup as an outpatient. The patient
was discharged in stable condition with no adverse drug reactions.
The patient will follow up with Dr. Gustavo Setaro in approximately
one to two weeks.

Transferred to Step-Down Unit on postoperative day 4.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: Mildly confused immediately postoperative , now
resolved , neurologically intact.
Cardiovascular: Cardiac meds: Aspirin , Lopressor , and Coumadin.
Hemodynamically stable on Lopressor , now back in Afib , stable
rate of 90s , respiratory ventilated greater than 24 hours
postoperatively. Extubated on postoperative day 1 without
complication. Currently on 5 liters of O2 and some pulmonary
edema , improving with Lasix 20 mg IV t.i.d. and diuresis.
GI: Failed speech and swallow. Bedside Dobhoff placed. Started
on Osmolite tube feeds at 20 mL an hour. Awaiting nutrition
input for goals. Needs video swallow to assess swallow function.
Renal: Appropriately diuresing , maintaining 1.5 liters negative
until preop weight.
Endocrine: Stable on CVI. Hematology: Anticoagulation.
Coumadin and aspirin for atrial fibrillation.
ID: No issues. Prophylactic antibiotics for chest tubes. In
step-down unit proceeded to progress well. Postop day 4 strict
n.p.o. per speech and swallow for aspiration with all
consistencies , currently on sitter. Postop day #5 , the patient
self discontinued the Dobbhoff feeding tube twice last night
requiring meds IV today until tube replaced and KUB confirmed tip
this afternoon. Dobbhoff currently okay to use. We will resume
tube feeds. Heart rate elevated to 90s-130s and also run of VT ,
which was asymptomatic. Rechecking electrolytes , BP stable.
Preop EF of 45%. Ordered echo to assess postop EF given run of
VT , which was 9 beats. Normal a.m. electrolytes. Remains on 3
liters of O2 , diuresing well. Speech and swallow will reassess
next week. Strict n.p.o. for history of aspiration. Afebrile.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Lightheadness , nausea
---
DDX: Hypertensive Urgency
---
HPI: 77 year old female with CAD s/p three stents , DM , HTN and CKD
was sent to ED by PCP after she presented to office with malaise ,
nausea and lightheadedness. Her symptoms first developed on
Thursday. She had checked her BS and BP at that time and they were
300 and 150 systolic. Her symptoms resolved but returned on Sunday
PTA and persisted throughout the day so Monday she went to
see her PCP. At the PCPs office her BP was noted to be 212 systolic
and she was sent to the ED for evaluation. Of note , on route to the
PCP office she had a fleeting episode of chest ""cramping"" which
was unlike her previous angina or MI pain. ---
In the ED: The patient received labetolol 10mg IV X2 , labetolol 400mg
po X1 , nitropaste 3"". Her BP remained above 200 despite these
medications and then she received hydralazine 10mg IV X1 which
resulted in dropping her BP to 150 systolic.

---
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for management of
hypertensive urgency.
---
CV: The cause of her high BP is not clear. There is no indication of
med non-compliance. Her PCP reports labile BPs are a problem for her.
Her BP was controlled after she arrived to the floor. She
was resumed on her home dose of Labetolol. There was discussion of
increasing her labetolol dose but this ended up not being necessary.
In fact she was symptomatic with a BP of 120 in terms of
feeling lightheaded. Therefore her hold parameters were increased to
130 systolic. In addition she had occasional ectopic apical heart
beats which resulted in early QRS complex and occasional
slight pauses <2sec. No major events on telemetry. Her heart rate was
relatively slow around 50-55 much of the time. Her EKG did show
slight ( 1mm ) ST segment depressions in antero-lateral leads and her
CKMB was elevated on admission. She ruled out for MI with three sets
of neg troponins. She may have had slight demand ischemia in setting
of hypertension. Her CKMB was normal on day of discharge. Her troponins
were always negative. She had no s/s of CHF. She was monitored on
telemetry with no major events.
---
RENAL: The patient is a diabetic and in addition reports a recent
history of contrast induced nephropathy. She had proteinuria on
admission which is slighly higher than usual ( 3+ compared to 2+ ) but
her creatinine was improved from baseline to 1.6 ( 1.8-2.2 ). A renal
ultrasound showed normal kidneys with no hydronephrosis. UPEP , SPEP
and spot urine/protein were ordered. Her spot urine protein was 222. Her
proteinuria in a chronic problem. UPEP/SPEP need to be followed up as
outpt but suspicion for malignancy is very low.
---
ENDO: The pt has history of DM and takes Lantus and Humolog at home.
She missed her lantus dose the night of admission and subsequent am
BS was high. She received NPH to cover her for the HD#1 and then
she resumed Lantus that evening. She also received her home humulog
and a sliding scale. She received a carb controlled diet. Her TSH was
1.2 on home Levoxyl.
---
FEN: Her lytes were repleted as needed.
---
GI: Her renal ultrasound showed sludge in the gallbladder and a
slightly distended CBD. Bili T and D were added and are normal. She had
no abd pain or tenderness so her gallbladder sludge is not likely to
represent a pathology.
---
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Monitor your BP at home and call your PCP if >180.
2. Monitor Fingersticks at home three times a day ( before each meal ) and
record in a note book to bring to PCP appointment
3. Return to ED if you experience chest pain , shortness of breath ,
worsening nausea , extreme sweating , fainting , falling or other concerns
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Follow up UPEP/SPEP. Follow Blood Pressures. Follow Fingersticks.

The condition responsible for causing this admission is
congestive heart failure exacerbation. Other diagnoses include
left bundle branch block , paresthesias in the fingers , benign
prostatic hypertrophy , prostatic adenocarcinoma , Gleason's score
2/4 , C5-C6 and C6-C7 disk disease , status post left nephrectomy
for renal cell carcinoma , hyperplastic polyps in 1993 and also
status post AICD and dual chamber pacer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73-year-old male
well known to the CHF Service with long-standing New York Heart
Association class 3B idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy presenting
with shortness of breath and increasing orthopnea over the last
night prior to admission from 8 to 9 p.m. The patient first went
to An Medical Center ER then left AMA without further treatment after
waiting four hours. He reports increasing cough with white
sputum since 5/8 , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea especially
over the last three days. Also there is a questionable increase
in abdominal distention. The patient had been admitted five
times in the last six months with the last admission also for
worsening dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and cough in which he
notably had a TEE-guided cardioversion and diuresis. He was
discharged on creatinine of 1.7. The patient freely admits that
he has had dietary indiscretion over the last two months ,
claiming that he has been ""eating like a horse"" with meat and
heavy sauces on pasta. The patient denies chest pain , fevers ,
sick contacts , chills , weight gain or nausea.
ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to erythromycin and
penicillin , which causes a rash. He also describes an allergy to
contrast.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was alert and oriented and in
no acute distress with blood pressure of 82/62 , heart rate of 80
beats per minute. His HEENT exam was unremarkable. Carotid
upstrokes were brisk without bruits. There were no thyromegaly
and his chest exam was clear to auscultation and percussion.
Cardiac exam did demonstrate JVP of about 18 cm and also regular
rate and rhythm with an S1 , S2 as well as an S3 and 1/6
holosystolic murmur at the apex. The abdominal exam was notable
for an enlarged abdomen , but nondistended and without pulsatile
palpable liver edge. There was no tenderness to palpation. The
extremities were warm and with 1+ distal pulses and only trace
edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission were notable for BUN of 45 ,
creatinine of 1.6 , K of 4.3 and sodium of 136. The INR was 1.3.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular. The patient was in volume overload and his
ARB and Aldactone were held. Aggressive diuresis was undertaken
for most of this stay including an IV Lasix drip , which was later
weaned to a torsemide IV b.i.d. which was later changed to p.o.
b.i.d. for a questionable reaction to the IV formation in the
form of itchiness. He was also put on Zaroxolyn throughout the
stay and he was started on dopamine drip , which was later
discontinued on 7/20/05 for long runs of NSVT that he had
possibly secondary to sensitivity to the dopamine. However ,
dobutamine was started on 2/11/05 and this dosage was increased
gradually over 8/1/05 to 1/19/05 to rate about 3 mcg/kg and
the patient tolerated this dosage fairly well. In addition ,
electrolytes were repleted throughout the stay and the patient
underwent a workup for an LVAD placement including PFTs ,
peripheral and carotid Dopplers and an abdominal ultrasound. He was shown to
have significant aortic vascular disease which was felt to represent a
contra-indication for LVAD. Discussion ongoing with the patient during his
stay revealed that he would prefer not to have the LVAD
even if he were eligible. He understood that he was not likely to live long
with the severity of his heart failure. The decision was later made to send
the patient home with a Hickman catheter placed on 11/6/05 , so that he could
receive home dobutamine. In terms of ischemia , the first set of
enzymes were flat and ischemia was judged not to be an active
issue. There were no changes on EKG. In terms of rhythm , the
patient does have history of prior AFib , however , he has remained
in normal sinus rhythm , status post cardioversion. He has had
asymptomatic runs of NSVT on the dopamine and less so on the
dobutamine as mentioned above. Currently he was paced with an
AICD. We kept the patient on amiodarone and digoxin as well as
on tele.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency and is status post left nephrectomy. We monitored
the patient's BUN and creatinine while diuresing and although ,
the patient did have an increased BUN to about 70 , diuretic
treatment was continued as a primary goal.
3. Endo. The patient has diabetes and we held oral glycemics ,
putting him on regular insulin sliding scale and NPH doses. Also
the patient had low TSH. This is probably due to subclinical
hypothyroidism or sick euthyroid.
4. Heme. The patient is on Coumadin as an outpatient and we
titrated his INR to a goal of 2-3. The patient did have some
nosebleeds on 10/21 and his Coumadin was temporarily held , but
restarted again for this goal of 2-3 later. The INR goal was
decreased less than 1.5 where the placement of Hickman catheter
with the plan to restart the Coumadin after placement.
5. Prostate. The patient does have a history of prostate
adenocarcinoma , Gleason 2/5 on biopsy in 2004. This has been
discussed with the patient by his urologist and the patient has
refused surgery now with an increased PSA , however , we did
consult a Urology while the patient was here and it was deemed
that his prostate should not be a major prognostic consideration
given the degree of his heart failure.
Physical exam at discharge , in general the patient was
comfortable and in no apparent distress , sitting up and eating
his food comfortably as far as the HEENT and neck exam his JVP
was about 10 cm. Cardiovascular exam showed occasional PVCs and
a loud P2 and S3. In general unchanged from admission.
Respiratorywise his lungs were clear to auscultation and breath
sounds were equal bilaterally. His abdomen was somewhat
decreased in size from admission , soft and non-tensed.
Extremities were warm without edema. Pulses were 1+ radial and
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally as with admission he did have
some wasted lower extremities.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home with VNA
Services. The plan is to follow his INR on Coumadin and to
continue to monitor his heart for NSVT while on dobutamine. Also
consider an ARB or Aldactone. The patient has stable kidney
function with decreasing creatinine.

Discharge Date: 3/5/1994
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. PULMONARY EMBOLUS
2. DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year old woman
with dilated cardiomyopathy secondary
to Adriamycin , status post recent admission for increased shortness
of breath and left pleural effusion. He returns now with increased
cough productive of white phlegm and progressive dyspnea on
exertion. The patient has a history of breast carcinoma in 1989 ,
treated with left lumpectomy x 2 and XRT , accompanied by
chemotherapy completed in early 1990. The patient then presented in
July of 1992 with progressive dyspnea on exertion , found to have
an ejection fraction of 17%. She was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy
felt secondary to Adriamycin toxicity. She was then treated with
Digoxin , Lasix , Captopril and Coumadin with good result. She had
subsequent development of SVT with a rapid ventricular rate of
approximately 180. The patient eventually underwent EPEP studies
with therapeutic ablation. Subsequently she had done quite well
until February of 1994 when she presented with mild cough
productive of white phlegm and increasing symptoms of right and
left-sided heart failure. She was treated with increased Lasix and
Digoxin and an empiric course of amoxicillin with little change in
her symptoms. She was then admitted on 8/7 after she was found to
have a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient underwent
ultrasound guided thoracentesis complicated by a pneumothorax
requiring chest tube placement. Evaluation of the pleural fluid
revealed a transudative effusion with all cultures and cytology
remaining negative. The patient was treated with Ancef for
approximately 7 days while the chest tube was in place and then
discharged on 6/20/94. Since that time the patient has had no
improvement in her symptoms but rather notes increasing cough which
remains productive of white sputum with occasional ""specks of red""
and progression of her dyspnea on exertion. She is now unable to
go greater than six steps of stair without significant dyspnea.
This is a significant change from approximately one month ago where
she was able to go two flights without extreme difficulty. She has
stable 3 + pillow orthopnea and pedal edema. Her weight has
increased only slightly recently. She denies any fever , chills ,
sweats , chest discomfort or pleuritic chest pain. She does not
anorexia and malaise without myalgias or arthralgias. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: 1. Dilated cardiomyopathy as above. 2. Breast carcinoma
as above. 3. Hypothyroid 4. Depression ALLERGIES: No known drug
allergies. Habits , distant tobacco use , none since 1967 , no ETOH.
MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.25 mg q day , Lasix 80 mg q day , Capoten 50
mg t.i.d. , aspirin one per day , Synthroid 2 gr. per day , Tamoxifen
10 mg b.i.d. , Elavil 75 mg q day , K-Dur 1 q day. SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient lives with her boyfriend , she is widowed without
children. She is a semi-retired Accounts Manager. FAMILY HISTORY:
There is no family history of cardiac disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 100.6 , blood pressure 116/65 ,
heart rate is 100 , respiratory rate 18. 02
saturation 90% on room air. The patient is alert , responsive ,
febrile and in no acute distress. Her conjunctiva are clear ,
extraocular movements intact , her oropharynx is clear. She has no
lymphadenopathy. Jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm at
30 degrees. Lung examination is remarkable for a few rales at the
left base , decreased breath sounds at the right base with dullness
to percussion. Cardiac examination , regular rate and rhythm with
normal SI , SII , positive SIII. Abdomen is soft and non-tender ,
slightly distended. She has pitting edema almost to the knees
bilaterally. Neurological examination is non focal.
LABORATORY DATA: SMA-7 is notable for a potassium of 5.4 and
creatinine of 1.2 with a BUN of 20. CBC
demonstrated a white count of 14 , hematocrit of 42.9 , platelets
289 , Digoxin level was 1.2. Chest x-ray showed a left pleural
effusion which is unchanged , a new right pleural effusion +-
consolidation. EKG showed sinus rhythm at 98 , left axis deviation ,
normal intervals , low voltage with poor R wave progression , no
significant change compared with 7/24/94.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with a picture of chronic
productive cough , progressive dyspnea with low
grade fevers and increased white blood cell count , in addition to
new opacity on chest x-ray. This clinical picture was felt to be
mostly from a progressive infectious process superimposed on
underlying congestive heart failure versus post-obstructive
infection versus atelectasis with an endobronchial lesion. The
patient was started on empiric course of antibiotics including
cefotaxime and clarithromycin. She was seen in consultation by the
Pulmonary Service which felt that a therapeutic trial of aggressive
diuresis was warranted prior to any more aggressive intervention
such as bronchoscopy or repeat thoracentesis. The patient was thus
treated with aggressive IV diuresis with excellent symptomatic
result. As her symptoms and chest x-ray cleared , it was felt that
a chest CT would be valuable in evaluating her left lower lobe for
possible endobronchial lesion leading to volume loss. She thus
underwent a chest CT on 2/6/94 with demonstration of a large
peripheral , red , right lower lobe opacity , highly suggestive of a
right lower lobe pulmonary infarction. No endobronchial lesions or
lymphadenopathy were noted. Given the patient's history of dilated
cardiomyopathy , off anticoagulation , an extensive discussion of the
chest CT findings with the Chest Radiologist and Pulmonary Consult
Team , it was felt that the patient should be treated empirically
for a pulmonary embolus. She was thus started on IV Heparin with
achievement of therapeutic PTT prior to switching to oral Coumadin
without complications. In addition the patient underwent lower
extremity non-invasives which were negative for deep venous
thrombosis as well as a cardiac echocardiogram which showed no
evidence of RV strain or right ventricular thrombus. Of note , this
echocardiogram again demonstrated moderately large left ventricle
with severely depressed systolic function and an estimated ejection
fraction of 15-20%. Though the possibility that the wedge shaped
opacification seen on CT was due to pneumonia rather than
infarction , it was felt that given the patient's low ejection
fraction she would need to be anticoagulated on this basis alone ,
and thus pulmonary angiogram or VQ scan would not be likely to
alter management. The patient was discharged to home.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS:

INTERIM DISCHARGE SUMMARY
SERVICE: Cardiology Tuc Pla
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. CHF exacerbation.
2. Atrial fibrillation and flutter.
LIST OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES:
1. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
2. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 77-year-old male with a
history of CAD , CHF with an ejection fraction of 30% , atrial
fibrillation ( diagnosed in 2000 , status post 4 cardioversions , on
amiodarone until January 2005 , when it was discontinued due to skin
discoloration; since then , the patient has been on Toprol ) ,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , who has done well since a
stent was placed in 2002 , not requiring any hospitalizations for
cardiac-related issues. In July 2006 , he notes that he began to
feel weak with increased dyspnea on exertion and occasional
palpitations , although he denied any chest pain. He was found to
be in atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin , with
continuation of the Toprol for rate control. He was cardioverted
in September 2006 , resulting in symptomatic improvement until January 2006
when he again reportedly felt weak , had increased dyspnea with
exertion. An echocardiogram was done in January 2006 , showing an
ejection fraction of 28%. Given his increased risk for sudden
death , a single-chamber ICD was placed.
He continued to feel even more unwell towards the later end of
January , with episodes of nausea , diaphoresis , shortness of breath ,
and abdominal pain with exertion ( these were his typical angina
symptoms in the past ). Consequently , ETT was done on 9/18/2006 ,
which was terminated after 1 minute when the patient's heart rate
went up to 130. Electrophysiology adjusted his ICD , still he
reports continued symptoms as previously described as well as
decreased appetite and weight gain of 15 pounds over 6 weeks. He
endorses worsening orthopnea and PND over the several weeks prior
to admission. He was started on amiodarone on 11/4/2006 for
atrial fibrillation. Given his worsening symptoms , he presented
to Dr. Gabard 's clinic on the day of admission for evaluation. He
was admitted for diuresis in the setting of a CHF exacerbation
and for consideration of options in the treatment of his atrial
fibrillation.

two at dinnertime.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for brother who died of an MI at age
58 , father who died of an MI at age 78 , and mother with
atherosclerosis.
ALLERGIES: Flagyl to which he gets edema and Demerol.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vitals were temperature of 95.7 ,
heart rate 80 , blood pressure 144/78 , respiratory rate 20 , O2
saturation 97% on room air. Generally , this is a
comfortable-at-rest-appearing gentleman in no respiratory
distress. Neck shows JVP is approximately 7 cm. His heart exam
is irregularly irregular with abnormal S1 and S2 , soft S3. Soft
systolic murmur at the right lower sternal border. No S4 or rub.
No heave or palpable thrill. His lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen is obese , mildly tender
without hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities are warm and well
perfused with 2+ pulses and 1+ pitting edema from ankles to
thighs bilaterally. His neuro exam is grossly intact , and he is
alert and oriented x3.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 137 , potassium 5.2 , BUN 33 ,
creatinine 1.6 , glucose 218. ALT 26 , AST 29 , total bilirubin
0.3 , alkaline phosphatase 66. BNP 659. White blood cells 599 ,
hematocrit 39.3 , platelets 196 , 000. Lipids: Total cholesterol
121 , triglycerides 166 , HDL 37 , LDL 51. EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with ventricular rate in the 70s. Normal intervals.
No ST changes. Echocardiogram , 10/27/2006 : Ejection fraction
30%. Left ventricular diameter , end-diastole , 6.2%; end-systole
4.8%. Septum is thin and akinetic at the apex. There is a
hypokinetic mid to distal wall , posterior and inferior wall.
Mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation. There is
a dilated aortic root. Chest x-ray , 10/27/2006 , shows
cardiomegaly with an interstitial process and without effusions.
PROCEDURES: On 2/25/2006 , the patient was started on
dofetilide.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient was started with a
diuretic regimen of Lasix 40 mg IV twice a day given that he
appeared to be volume overloaded by clinical exam. On
presentation , he was compensated for his congestive heart
failure , with a creatinine of 1.6. The daily goal for his was -2
to 2.5 L , and he did very well on this dose of Lasix for the in
and out goal. He was switched over to Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily on
10/20/2006. His Toprol was continued in-house , but his ACE
inhibitor was held in the setting of increases in his serum
creatinine. The plan was to restart his ACE inhibitor following
complete diuresis to dry weight. There were no symptoms or signs
consistent with ischemia in-house. The patient was continued on
aspirin and Zetia for hyperlipidemia.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: Given the patient's history of atrial
fibrillation and flutter since 2000 and his continued symptoms on
Toprol ( amiodarone was not an option that the patient wished to
pursue given the side effects of skin discoloration that he had
previously experienced ). It was decided to proceed with
dofetilide therapy on 10/20/2006. His QTc was monitored
throughout this process , and the plan was for a transesophageal
echocardiogram and DC cardioversion on 8/7/2006 for further
treatment of the atrial fibrillation. The patient's Coumadin was
continued in-house for a goal INR of between 2 to 3. To achieve
this goal , he was continued on his home regimen of Coumadin.
3. Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was taken
off oral hypoglycemics in-house but continued on his home dose of
Lantus 24 units before bedtime as well as an insulin sliding
scale.

Discharge Date: 6/1/2004
ATTENDING: FLORENCIO LUGER M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 46-year-old man with type 2 diabetes and a family
history significant for coronary artery disease including the
father who had an MI at the of 51 , was admitted to LM on 9/17
with acute chest pain. The patient was seen at an outside
hospital at 4:30 p.m. on 1/15/04. He developed acute onset of
substernal chest pain while riding on a train home from Mon Ph Pids
The pain radiated to both arms , left greater than right , jaw and
was associated with shortness of breath , nausea , and sweats. He
presented to the emergency room at the outside hospital and had
an EKG two hours later showing marked ST elevations in V2 and V3 ,
1 aVL and was reciprocal ST depressions inferiorly. The patient
was treated with aspirin , heparin , Plavix , and sublingual
nitroglycerin , Lopressor , Integrilin and was transferred to the
Ettecile Valley Hospital for an emergent PCI.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for type 2 diabetes controlled only with oral
hypoglycemics ( glyburide ) , anxiety.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Glyburide 10 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Of note , the patient recently with stress relating to his place
of work. The patient is expected a job interview on day of
admission to the hospital. The patient lives with his wife who
had an MI one year ago. The patient has no history of tobacco
with occasional alcohol one to two times a month , denies use of
street drugs.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
The patient was alert and oriented and in moderate amount of
distress secondary to anxiety following his cath. Vital Signs:
He had a temp of 100.2 , his blood pressure was 120/79 , and his
heart rate was 96 beats per minute. He was satting at 96% on 2 L
of nasal cannula. HEENT: His JVP was at 9 cm , he had 2+ carotids
without bruits. His extraocular motions were intact. His pupils
were equal , round , and reactive to light. His cardiac exam was
significant for regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , and an S4.
There were no murmurs. His lungs had decreased breath sounds on
the lower right base with crackles about one-third of the way up
on that side. His left lung was clear. His abdomen was soft ,
nontender , and nondistended. Bowel sounds were present.
Extremities: He had 2+ pedal pulses. There was no pitting edema.
Skin: Noted to be hypopigmented , the patient has a history of
albinism. Of note , one additional comment about his HEENT exam ,
the patient is legally blind. He is able to see most objects at
about 6 or 7 feet away from him.
His chest x-ray showed a right middle opacification concerning
for an infiltrative pneumonia. His EKG on admission post cath
showed a rate of 98 , sinus rhythm , and ST elevations 2 mm in V2
through V3 and ST depressions in leads II , III , and aVF. Labs on
admission were significant for creatinine of 1.4 up from a
baseline of 1.2. His cardiac enzymes showed a CK of 178 and MB
of 3.7 and troponin of less than assay. His CBC was normal.
There was no left shift. His UA was significant for a specific
gravity of 1.086 , 1+ protein , 3+ glucose , 2+ ketones , 2+ blood ,
1-3 white blood cells , 2-4 red blood cells , and trace bacteria.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. CV: Ischemia. An emergent cath on admission on 2/18/04
showed two-vessel disease and 100% LAD , osteal lesion , and a 90%
marginal 1 lesion. The LAD was stented with a 3.5 x 8 mm and a
3.0 x 13 mm and a 3.0 x 18 mm Cipher stents all to 0%. The
marginal 1 was not stented during this cath. The patient's CK
peaked at 10 , 438 , and a CK-MB at 452 and his troponin at 721.
The patient was transferred to the CCU after his cath. He was
treated with aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , captopril , Integrilin
x12 hours. The patient recovered well except for his heart rate
remained in tachycardiac at 90 to 110 range despite Lopressor
which was increased to 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. With the setting of
tachycardia , he developed ST elevation in 1 aVL with ST
depressions and 3 aVF in the evening of 3/7/04 , although his
cardiac enzymes continued to turn down. The patient underwent a
second cath on 8/12/04 , which showed that all his stents placed
in his LAD previously remained patent. The marginal 1 was
stented at this time with Cipher stent 0. The patient was doing
very well after his second procedure. His heart rate remained
slightly tachycardiac , the patient experienced no further EKG
changes.
2. Pump: The patient was on Lopressor and captopril , and his
blood pressure remained stable after his procedures. Echo on
2/10/04 showed an LVEF of 30% as well as akinesis of the mid
distal anterior wall felt in the entire apex. There was
hypokinesis of the basal anterior septum and the basal to mid
lateral wall with preserved function of the basal to mid inferior
and posterior wall. The apex is near aneurysmal. The patient
was put on heparin GTT given the risk of intraventricular
thrombus. The patient was started on Coumadin prior to
discharge.
3. Rhythm and rate: The patient remained mildly tachycardiac.
His Lopressor was titrated up to 100 mg q.i.d. for rate control
but no concerning arrhythmias were noted on telemetry. His sinus
tachycardia was thought to be secondary to a bacterial pneumonia.
4. Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes. The hemoglobin
A1c was 10.57 demonstrating the patient's conservative treatment
was insufficient. He was started on NPH and insulin sliding
scale in the hospital. Metformin was started on 1/12/04 , and he
was restarted on Glucotrol before discharge. Diabetic teaching
was instituted.
5. Renal: Mucomyst was given before and after both of his
caths. His creatinine turned into his baseline of 1.2.
6. Heme: The patient was sent home on Coumadin given his
echocardiogram significant for near aneurysmal LV and a
hypokinetic apex. The patient will need to be followed in
Coumadin Clinic. Code status for this patient remained full
throughout his hospitalization.
7. Pulmonary: The patient was noted to be febrile and to have a
right middle lobe infiltrate on admission. The patient was
treated with five days of levofloxacin but remained febrile and
tachycardiac. The patient was started on azithromycin for a
total of five-day course. The patient defervesced after 24 hours
of being on azithromycin. Also of note , on a follow-up chest
x-ray prior to discharge , was read as the patient having a
question of a cavitating lesion in his right lobe. It was
recommended that this be followed up as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
The patient was discharged on following medications.
Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tab sublingual q.5 minutes x2
doses p.r.n. for chest pain , azithromycin 500 mg p.o. q.d. x4
doses , simvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. , metformin 500 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
lisinopril 50 mg p.o. q.d. , Toprol XL 200 mg p.o. q.d. , and
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.p.m.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS:
1. The patient was instructed to call his cardiologist and
primary care doctor , Dr. Budd , within one to two days of
discharge. Dr. Osendorf is expecting the patient's call.
2. The patient is scheduled to go to the Coumadin Clinic at the
Opa Health within five days of discharge. Dr.
Callaway number of ( 733 ) 394-4873 was provided to the
patient and as well as the phone number for the Coumadin Clinic
at Tysco Oolwe Medical Center .

3. The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study
of February , 2003.
CC: Hypotension after dialysis
HPI: 56 yo male with h/o ESRD , CAD , CHF ( EF 20-25% ) admitted for
hypotension after HD. He was in his USOH until 2 days PTA when he
developed stomach upset , diarrhea , dry heaves , and a dry cough. He
denied recent travels , and had remote Abx use. At Stodun Hospital ,
he had 5.5 liters removed and afterwards his BP was 66/30. 1 liter of
NS was given and his BP rose to 73/40.
ROS: Chronic PND , uses 1 pillow , gained 8kg in 2 weeks but compliant

EKG: NSR , 1st deg AVB , LAE , LVH , old TWI in 1 , L , V5 , V6 , more pronounced
ST dep in V5 than 9/24
CXR: R pl effusion , CMG
Assessment: Hypotension after dialysis in setting of GI
upset/diarrhea/vomiting , likely was dehydrated. The BP rose after
fluids and his current hypoxia is likely from mild pulm edema.
Although chronically elevated cardiac enzymes , there is concern about
new ishemia , and concern for PE given hypoxia in ED.
Hospital course
1. CVS: Ischemia: NSTEMI: contined medical management with asa , beta
blocker , imdur , zocor , ntg prn. The CkMB peaked at 12 and Tni to 4. His
cardiologist ( Dr Benisek ) recommended PET scan to assess for viable
myocardium and ischemia. His last stress test 1 year ago showed only
scarring with no ischemia. In the past , pt's wife refused for him to go
for CABG. They are reconsidering this option currently.
The results of the PET scan are as follows:
- A small region of myocardial scar/hibernation along with mild
residual stress induced peri-infarct ischemia in the distal LAD
distribution.
- Moderate global LV systolic dysfunction.
- The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study of February ,
2003.
The family was called to stress the importance of follow up with
cardiology ( They have missed appointments in the past )
Pump: ( EF 20-25% ) , increased enalapril to 10mg bid , BNP was sent and
pending and echo revealed EF 30% , Mod AI.
Rhythm: no events occurred on telemetry
2. Pulm: monitored sats with fluid restriction. RA sats improved to
97%
3. Renal: HD MWF , home renal meds. He was dialyzed to a weight below
his previous baseline per cardiology recommendations. In the past he
has had elevated RH filling pressures after HD. The Ryi was
called by the attendting renal physician ( Dr. Slemp ) about his goal
weight.
4. ID: Blood cx were no growth
5. GI: He was continued on his home nexium
6. Proph: SQ heparin was used for DVT prophylaxis
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: It is very important that you attend your follow up appointment with
the cardiologist , Dr Ivrin
Please take the medications listed above and do not take enalapril on
mornings of dialysis
Please adhere to your dietary restrictions. If you gain more than 3 kg
between dialysis sessions please restrict your fluid intake. The diet
guidelines will be coordinated by the staff at Chapmed Gamette Medical Center

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mrs. Marnett is an 81 y.o. woman who presents with one day of
chest pain , difficulty speaking , nausea , and lightheadedness. She had
URI symptoms about two weeks ago and then 5d pta developed minimal
ly productive cough and then SOB for the past 2-3 days. She denies any
noctural dyspnea or increase in number of pillows. She lives alone ,
and a reverend checks up on her daily; the day prior to admission he
suggested she go to the hospital. She does not feel that she had any
speech difficulties at that time , but when she awoke she noted
heaviness of her tongue and workd finding difficulties. In addition , she
had sweating and chest pain that radiated to her shoulder ( L>R ) , and
back. This was different than her usual anginal symptoms ( which do not
involve back radiation ). The pain was pleuritic in nature , and she
denied palpitations. She also noticed nausea and had several episodes
of dry heaving. While leaving the bathroom she had a single episode of
""lightheadness."" This did not involve any sensation of vertigo , or any
vision changes. She sat down immediately , and felt better within a few
seconds. There was no fall and no LOC. Around 8am , her housekeeper
came , and immediately noticed a change in Mrs. Cooney 's voice. Mrs.
Solberg describes the change as a ""thickening of my tongue"" and some
problems finding words. She has been taking all of her medications as
prescribed over the last week.
ROS: On arrival to the floor , Mrs. Shoman noted a raised , painful
area on her L forearm. She does not recall any trauma to the area. She
denies any fever.

Hospital course by system:
Neuro: Speech difficulties: resolved by the time pt was in ER , making
diagnosis difficult. Possible etiologies include TIA or illness
exacerbating deficits from old stroke. Head CT in ER showed old
infarcts , but no acute process. Patient did not have any speech
difficulties throughout admission or other neurologic findings.
CV: ischemia: No ST changes on EKG , one set of cardiac enzymes were
negative. Given low probability of ischemia , no further enzymes were
drawn. Pump: EF 55% , patient was normotensive even after d/c of
some of her home HTN meds ( see renal ). Rhythm: pt was on telemetry for
first day of admission , and alternated between sinus rhythm and afib.
Pulm: PNA: pt had left lower lobe opacity on CXR. Decision was made to
start antibiotics. Pt had a positive d-dimer , but PE was very unlikely
in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation. The patient has a
history of CHF , but had no signs of CHF on exam during this
hospitalizaiton although her cxr was read as mild pulmonary edema.
Renal: ARF: Creatine on admission was 1.8 , up from a baseline of
1.2-1.3. Given her h/o poor po intake and euvolemic to dry exam ,
this was thought likely due to prerenal hypovolemia. Her
lasix , lisinopril and colchicine were held , as they might contribute to
further ARF , and she got gentle ivf ( approximately 1L ) and her
creatinine improved. However , after restarting her medications her Cr
again bumped to 1.8. Her UA was unremarkable. She was d/c home off
lasix , lisinopril and colchicine with a Cr of 1.8 presuming that sh
e was still prerenal. The plan is for VNA to check her chem7 in 3days
days , results to go to Dr. Skibo for monitoring and deciding when to
restart her medications.
MSK: Pt developed the left forearm swelling and pain while in the hosp
for the first night. A radiograph was negative for fracture and it was
felt to be a small hematoma. The pain remitted with Tylenol. At
discharge the pain was a dull ache , and the swelling was reduced.
Heme: Anticoagulation. She was maintained on her home dose of INR was
maintained in a theraputic range. This will have to be closely
monitored as an outpatient while on levofloxacin. Her INR was 3 after 2
days of levofloxacin and will be checked again by VNA 3 days
after discharge , results to be followed by Sheldon Dingmann
Endo: D.M. Pt was switched from micronase to glipizide 2.5mg qd given
her worsening renal insufficiency. Fingersticks remained in acceptable
range ( 100-148 ) during admission.
Dispo: to home with close VNA followup ( daily ). Pt will have weight
and BP checked qd. She will have Chem-7 and INR drawn on Thursday and
Monday , and the results will be called to Dr. Benamati ( TERT VALLEY HOSPITAL CENTER ). She will
finish 6 more days of Levo ( total 10 ).
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you develop a fever , become short of breath , have increasing left arm
pain , or any other symptoms that concern you , call your doctor.
The visiting nurse is an important followup to your
hospitalization.Your diabetes medication was changed to glipizide -stop
taking the micronase. Your lasix , lisinopril and colchicine have been
stopped , don't restart them until Dr. Schoville tells you to restart. Your othe
medications are the same. Weigh yourself daily and if your weight increa
ses more than 2lbs in 2 days call Dr. Szesterniak
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. VNA will check BP and weight qd. Any BP > 140/90 or wt gain of 2
lbs in 2 days will be called to Dr. Kempf ( BROTHERSCIAL GITER HEALTHCARE OF 703-958-5135 )
2. Thursday ( 20 of September ) and Mon ( 1 of April ) VNA will draw a Chem-7 and INR
and call results to Dr. Maria ( WA ASSPUNX HOSPITAL ); INR should be communicated to Blaine Lindquist at 731-463-2245.
3. Pt has followup appointment on 8 of September at 10:30am with
Dr. Speranza 4. There are 6 more days of Levofloxacin course.

Discharge Date: 8/9/1993
DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING ON
17 of October , BY DR. RAFALKO ,
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 58 year old male with
crescendo angina. The patient has a
long history of coronary artery disease and suffered an anterior
septal myocardial infarction in 1989. The patient did well on
medical management , until recently when he has developed increasing
fatigue and angina with decreased exertion. The patient had an
exercise stress thallium test on 16 of June , which showed ST depression
in V5 after 6 minutes and 38 seconds. The thallium aspect of the
test showed apical inferior reperfusion defect. A cardiac
catheterization in 18 of June , showed a 60 to 80% lesion at the left
anterior descending , 60% lesion of the first diagonal and 50%
lesion of the circumflex , 100% lesion of the right coronary artery.
Inferiorly , the heart was noted to be akinetic with areas of
dyskinesis. The ejection fraction was 45%. PA pressures were
32/20 with a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 13 mm/HG.
The patient now presents with increasing angina , failing medical
therapy. The patient denied a history of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , orthopnea , pedal edema. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY included
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus times 14 years , status post
cerebrovascular accident left parieto-occipital hemorrhagic infarct
without any cognitive residual defects. The patient has a seizure
disorder since then , controlled on phenobarbital. History also
included hypertension , bursitis. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY included
status post right knee surgery times 3 , status post patellar
fracture in 1958. ALLERGIES included Demerol , which produces
nausea and vomiting. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Cardizem-CD 240
milligrams by mouth each day , Isordil 40 milligrams by mouth 3
times a day , Lopressor 200 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
enteric-coated aspirin 1 each day discontinued 10 days prior to
admission , phenobarbital 30 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day ,
humulin 70/30 - 36 units each morning. FAMILY HISTORY was
significant for myocardial infarction. HABITS included a
90-pack-year smoking history , discontinued in 1989. Alcohol use
was discontinued in 1991.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a nervous , but pleasant
white male in no apparent distress. The
temperature was 97.7 , pulse 76 , respiratory rate 24 , blood pressure
136/84 , 98% room air saturation. Cardiac examination showed
regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , without murmurs , gallops or
rubs. Neck was supple. Chest was clear to auscultation. Abdomen
was obese , soft , positive bowel sounds. Extremities showed pulses
intact bilaterally , no varicosities , no bruits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and underwent the usual
preoperative evaluation , and was taken to the
operating room on 17 of October , for 3-vessel coronary artery bypass
grafting by Dr. Mcquerry The patient tolerated the procedure well ,
and initially recovered in the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was followed by the Cardiology Service as is routine.
The patient's lines and tubes were pulled in the usual fashion at
the appropriate times. The patient was stable and was transferred
to the Step-Down Cardiac Surgery Floor. Postoperatively , the
patient developed atrial fibrillation , which resolved
spontaneously. postoperatively , the lower sternal wound had a
small amount of serosanguineous drainage and a small amount of
erythema. The patient was given a course of intravenous Ancef.
The patient received a total of 5 days of intravenous Ancef. The
patient was discharged home on 6 of February , tolerating a regular diet
and ambulating without difficulty. The patient's wound had cleared
up and was free of erythema or drainage. The sternum was stable at
discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. MEDICATIONS
ON DISCHARGE were Tylenol #3 as needed ,
enteric-coated aspirin 1 each day , Lopressor 25 milligrams by mouth
twice a day , phenobarbital 45 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day ,

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
71F with extensive PMHs including CHF , diastolic
dysfxn ( EF 60% ) , AS , AFib , DM , CRI , OSA p/w progressive dyspnea , fatigue ,
periph edema , weight gain. Admitted 3wks ago w/similar complaints -
was diuresed heavily w/~8lb weight loss
and symptomatic relief. Post D/C , did well for a
few days , then started developing progressive DOE ,
fatigue , orthopnea , as well as weight gain
of ~8-10lbs. On admission , she could not walk more than few feet w/o
SOB. Pt claimed that she was compliant with her medications and
practiced dietary
discretion. On day of present admission , pt presented w/CHF flare ,
acute
on chronic RF. In ED , BP 87/45 , P 75 , 96%RA , afeb. EKG showed AF with
no ST-T changes , enz neg. HCT 30.7 , BUN 105 , Cr
2.4 ( baseline Cr
~2.0 ) PE: AOx3 , resp distress , JVP? , S1S2 ,
3/6 AS murmur , trace rales , abd? , 3+ pitting LE
edema. Impression: 71yo woman w/CHF , AFib , AS , DM ,
CRI , w/hx of recent CHF exacerbation now p/w with
vol overload , dyspnea , and renal failure. Etiology of CHF exacerbation
unclear:she r/o for MI , no worsening of her afib , no si/sx's of
infection ,
no hx to suggest dietary indiscretion , medical non-compliance , lack of
medications CV:Isch- no evidence of ischemia: pt r/o for MI with
negative enzymes. PUMP: Pt was gently diuresed ~2L/day on Torsemide
100 IV TID x 4 days with excellent response and then switched to her
home diuretic regiment of 100 mg BID of PO torsemide and 5 mg PO
Zaroxolyn on the day prior to discharge still with good diuretic
effect. Her admission wt was 132.9KG and on day of discharge she
weighed 125.8kg: net total loss of 7.1 kg or 15.6 lbs per this admit.
During this admission , strict I/O's , daily weight. fluid
and salt restriction were maintained. She was not re-started on
Cozaar given BP's in low range with SBP:90;s. RHYTHM: chronic afib
w/good rate
control w/o agent and no rate issues during this admission. Pt is not
on coumadin given hx
of GI bleed. Pulm: Pt was continued on her Advair disk , flonase , prn
nebs. She was placed on CPAP @ night and did well with cpap;
arrangements were made for pt to have her CPAP at home changed to
hospital setting and equipment. HEME:1 )ANEMIA
Pt was admitted with HCT of 30.7 , lower then her normal. She had 3
positive stool guiaic's , low normal Fe
studies , and stable HCT during this admission. Her ASA was stopped 2/2
concern for GIB. Pt is scheduled to follow-up with her GI doctor , Dr. Ethan Wasowski 2 days after discharge.2 )THROMBOCYTOPENIA:pt had a drop in
platlets that was initially concerning , but ultimately appeared
to be lab variation with its resolution on the next blood
draw. RENAL:Pt was admitted with acute
on chronic renal failure felt to be secondary to decreased CO. Her CRT
elevation gradually resolved from 2.4 on admission to 1.8 at time of
discharge. Her celebrex was stopped 2/2 ARF.
Proph: Pt was placed on
Heparin 5000u SC BID for DVT prophylaxis and Nexium
40 GI:Pt was noted to have elevated LFT's on admission labs. Her peak
LFT's were ALT:368 , AST: 274 , AP:158 with nl BILIT 0.5 and biliD
0.3. DDX included congestion vs infection vs medications. hepatitis
deemed unlikely but hep panel still pending at time of discharge.
Since pt's LFT's did not resolve with excellent diuresis , it was felt
that it was not likely due to congestion. Most likely etiology was felt
to be reaction to drug. Pt was taken off the following hepatotoxic
meds: tylenol , statin , percocet , allopurinol. She was continued on her
tamoxifen , although case reports of hepatotoxicity noted; other
consideration included the neurontin , but lft's began to normalize on
medication. Pt is scheduled to follow-up with GI , Dr. Hornshaw 2
days following discharge. FEN: Pt's lytes were aggressively repleted;
she required significant K repletion each day and will be d/c'd on K.
She was maintained on a NA and fluid restriction and placed on a
cardiac and diabetic diet. ( ENDO ): DM: Pt was initially placed on RISS
given concern for hypogylcemia and her home regiment was gradually
added to her inpatient regiment with elevated FS.
Pt was stable at time of discharge , sx's much improved , and scheduled f
or follow-up with cardiologist and CHF nurse on 8/28/03.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1 )please stop the following medications: tylenol , percocet , Zocor ,
cozaar , celebrex , allopurinol , aspirin
2 )follow-up on your liver enzyme elevations and guiaic positive stools
with Dr. Kemfort
3 )if you have any worsening shortness of breath , fatigue , lower
extremity swelling , or any concerning symptoms , please call your doctor
immediately.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1 )follow-up for LFT elevations: hepatitis panel still pending at d/c
2 )follow-up for guiaic( + )stool and Hct drop
3 )The following medications were stopped during this admission given
concern re: elevated LFT's , ARF , and guiaic + stools: tylenol ,
percocet , zocor , cozaar , celebrex , allopurinol , ASA.

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS ( to CCU admission ):
The patient was admitted to IMH on 5/25/06. He had been behaving unlike
himself and was having black tarry stools for two days. The patient was found
to
be guaiac positive. A head CT showed no new lesions but did show
multiple infarcts that were known to be old. On 10/18/06 , the
patient had an EGD showing clot in the distal esophagus. This
clot was removed , and the possible culprit vessel was clipped.
Around midnight on 8/19/06 , the patient became borderline
hypertension for an unclear reason. His hematocrit was
stable. The patient's ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
were held. Also , the patient's Lasix was
held. On 8/19/06 at around 4:00 a.m. , the patient was
reportedly having fitful sleeping and went to the bathroom. Soon
afterwards , the nurse noticed that the patient was having more
ectopy on telemetry. Soon after 4:30 a.m. , the patient was
either found unresponsive or ventricular fibrillation was seen on
telemetry and a code was called. The rhythm was shown to be
V-fib. Chest compressions were initiated , and the patient was
shocked. Soon thereafter , he had two more shock episodes for
V-fib and was loaded on amiodarone 300 mg IV x1. Soon
thereafter , his V-fib terminated and subsequently , the patient
had an episode of slow PEA treated with atropine , epinephrine ,
calcium and magnesium. Code labs showed a potassium of 3.3. The
patient was intubated. A left femoral line was placed. The
patient was transported to the CCU with stable blood pressure on
neosynephrine. He was easily weaned off neosynephrine. The
patient does not have any history of an arrhythmia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
The patient's past medical history is significant for:;
1. coronary artery disease status post CABG ( SVG to RCA ) with mitral valve
replacement in 1999. In 2003 , the
patient underwent catheterization for unstable angina. The LAD
and D1 were stented. In 2004 , the patient underwent
catheterization for unstable angina showing restenosis of D1
which was re-stented.
2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
3. CVA.
4. Seizure disorder.
5. Subdural hematoma while on Coumadin , status post burr hole
evacuation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
On admission on 10/20/06 , the patient's vital signs were
temperature 98.3 , pulse 86 , blood pressure 122/73 , respiratory
rate 16 , O2 sat 97% on room air. He was not in any acute
distress. He was alert and oriented x3. He was interactive and
appropriate. Skin was normal. HEENT showed an old left-sided
facial droop which was unchanged per patient and the family. The
JVP was 6 cm. There was no lymphadenopathy. The chest was
clear. Cardiac exam showed a mechanical S1 and normal S2 , no
extra sounds or murmurs. Abdominal exam was benign. Extremities
had 2+ pulses without clubbing , cyanosis or edema. Neurological
exam showed a left-sided facial hemiparesis. Otherwise , cranial
nerves II through XII were intact. The patient had 4/5 strength
on the left side , 5/5 strength on the right side. Toes were
downgoing.
ADMISSION LABS:
Labs on admission were notable for a creatinine of 1.7 , glucose
of 237 , hematocrit of 37.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
10/18/06 , elective inpatient EGD for heme-positive black stool
performed by Dr. Marlin Shigo in the presence of Dr. Val Blache
On 11/16/06 , urgent cardiac cathet1erization for cardiac arrest
performed by Dr. Monte Lenig with stent placement in the
circumflex.
On 4/22/06 , dual chamber ICD placed by Dr. Danni
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
This is a 66-year-old man with coronary artery disease and
mitral valve replacement. He was initially admitted for an upper
GI bleed and was then admitted to the CCU status post V-fib arrest
and found to have NSTEMI. His course in the CCU was as follows:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: NSTEMI. The patient had a troponin elevation
beginning 15 minutes after a code was started , suggesting that the NSTEMI
occurred
and then caused V-fib arrest. The peak troponin was 111.
Cardiac catheterization showed severe 3-4 vessel disease ,
and occlusion of the SVG graft. Two drug-eluting stents were placed
in the left circumflex. The patient was treated with aspirin ,
Plavix , beta-blocker , and ACE. The patient's beta-blocker and
ACE doses were titrated during his hospital stay. The patient
was also taken off of Lipitor briefly due to concern about his
liver function. At discharge , he is being restarted on his
outpatient doses of Lipitor as well as a Fibrate.
B. Pump: The patient had congestive heart failure causing
pulmonary edema. By echo , he had an ejection fraction of 25-30%
with a moderately dilated left ventricle , severe global
hypokinesis with posterior and inferior akinesis. The patient
diuresed well during his CCU stay and on the floor. His I's and
O's were followed. He was net negative , and he was discharged
at a weight of 87 kilos. The patient had an echo to evaluate
for dyssynchrony. This echo did not find significant evidence of
dyssynchrony.
C. Rhythm: The patient had a V-fib arrest and returned to
normal sinus rhythm. He received an amiodarone load as well as
amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. After he stabilized , the amiodarone was
discontinued after AICD implantation on on 7/1/06. The implantation itself
was uncomplicated though the patient developed hives thought to be due to
administration of prophylactic Ancef. The patient was switched
to vancomycin for prophylaxis , followed by po clindamycin. His allergic
symptoms
resolved with one dose of IV Benadryl.
2. GI: The patient came in with an upper GI bleed. A bleeding
vessel at the GE junction was clipped. The patient had a
transient LFT elevation consistent with shock liver. LFTs were
followed and declined appropriately during his hospitalization
and normalized before discharge. The patient was also maintained
on a proton pump inhibitor during his stay.
3. Hematocrit: The patient was transfused two units of red blood
cells on 4/12/06 and 9/28/06. His hematocrit remained stable therafter. The
patient was taking Lovenox as an
outpatient for protection of his mechanical mitral valve. During
the peri-procedure period for his ICD implantation , the patient
was switched to heparin drip and was maintained on the heparin
drip for four days after device implantation. At that time , he
was restarted on his outpatient regimen of Lovenox 70 mg b.i.d.
4. Neuro: The patient has a history of CVA with a residual left
hemiparesis. These symptoms were stable. The patient was also
seen by the Psychiatry Service to evaluate his memory deficits
and abilities to make decisions. The Psychiatry team recommended
that the patient be followed by Neurology after discharge and
that the patient be considered for a formal neuropsychiatric
testing for evaluation of his neurologic and cognitive deficits.
5. Pulmonary: The patient's pulmonary edema resolved with
diuresis.
6. ID: The patient presented with fever and an elevated white
blood cell count initially and a question of an infiltrate on chest
x-ray. This patient was covered with levofloxacin and Flagyl for
three days empirically for aspiration pneumonia. During
hospitalization , he did have very transient low-grade
temperatures on two other occasions. Cultures including chest
x-ray , urine and blood cultures were negative. The patient was afebrile prior
to discharge. As of the day of
this dictation , C. difficile tests were also negative.
7. Renal: The patient's creatinine was elevated reaching a peak
of 1.9 on 4/12/06 in the setting of his cardiac arrest. The
patient's creatinine normalized and on the day prior to discharge
was 1.2.
8. Nutrition: The patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow.
Initially , he was put on a puree-thin diet that was advanced to
mechanical soft and thin liquids prior to discharge.
9. Endocrine: The patient is diabetic and was maintained on NPH
22 units b.i.d. and a sliding scale. At the time of discharge ,
the patient's blood sugars were well controlled. He is being
discharged on Lantus 48 units at bedtime ( a light increase over his outpatinet
dose ) as well as a NovoLog sliding scale for coverage during meals.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
On the day of discharge , the patient was afebrile. Heart rate
70-80s , blood pressure 90-120/66-70. Oxygen saturation 96-98% on
room air. Weight 87 kilograms. Pertinent labs include a
creatinine of 1.2 , hematocrit of 36. The patient's exam showed
continuing left facial hemiparesis. Lungs were clear. Cardiac
exam was notable for a mechanical S1 , no extra sounds or murmurs.
His abdomen was soft , and the ICD placement site was well healed
without swelling , tenderness or erythema.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 72-year-old woman with
history of diverticulitis who
presented with a diverticular abscess with nausea , vomiting and
crampy abdominal pain.

ALLERGIES: Sulfa , erythromycin , levofloxacin , IV dye , iron.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 72-year-old female with a history of
diverticulitis who presented with crampy
abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting times several days. CT on
admission noted a diverticular abscess. CT was unable to drain it
due to its limited size. However , the patient continued to have
crampy abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting. The patient was taken
to the OR on 10/19/01 for an exploratory laparotomy , sigmoid
colectomy and colostomy. The patient tolerated the procedure well
and was maintained NPO , with an epidural for pain control , until
return of bowel function as witnessed by the gas and feces in the
colostomy bag.
By the time of discharge , the patient was ambulating with a wheeled
walker. She was tolerating a regular diet , had good pain control
on 2-4 mg q.4h. of Dilaudid. Of note , the patient has a
significant history of coronary artery disease , had a rule out MI
postoperatively with initial evidence of cardiac injury. However ,
the patient did complain of some atypical chest pain on
postoperative day #3. A repeat rule out MI illustrated a troponin
leak likely secondary to increased cardiac demands postoperatively.
The patient was started on diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. in order to
control rates with a good effect. The patient was also continued
on a course of IV antibiotics , ampicillin , ceftazidime , Flagyl and
Diflucan. Drainage from that particular abscess eventually
revealed enterococci , yeast and Pseudomonas responsive to these
antibiotics.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST STENT OF
THE RCA.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: EXTENSIVE CARDIAC HISTORY , DVT WITH
PE X TWO , CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ,
HEPATITIS B POSITIVE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63-year-old male presenting
with unstable angina. His first presentation with coronary disease
was in 1986 , when he ruled in for MI and a cath revealed 100%
occlusion of the circumflex , 99% D1 , and a subsequent angioplasty
of the circ to a 70% residual. He had an exercise treadmill two
months later and a repeat cath at that time showed 95% restenosis
of the circ and a 60% LAD lesion , and a 90% D1. In October of
1992 the patient again presented with exertional angina. Cath
revealed 70% occlusion of the RCA , 70-80% LAD , and diffuse disease
in the circumflex with a 50% mid-circumflex lesion. He had diffuse
global hypokinesis and an EF of 40-50%. His angina progressed and
in 1994 he underwent a four vessel CABG , SVG to the PDA and OM-1 ,
and a LIMA to the LAD and D2. He did well until 1997 , when he
presented with presyncope and was found to have a massive saddle
pulmonary embolism. He had a negative hypercoagulative workup
after this. In the recent years he has had a number of episodes of
epigastric pain with exertion and positive stress tests , but no
additional myocardial infarctions. His most recent cath in July
of 1997 showed an occluded circumflex , 80% LAD , and subtotal
occlusion distally , a 60% mid-RCA lesion , and patent SVG to the PDA
and the OM , as well as the LIMA to the LAD. In recent months the
patient describes increasing frequency of anginal episodes provoked
by walking more than five minutes or climbing stairs. Most often
the pain is epigastric , but occasionally substernal. He denies
associated symptoms of nausea , diaphoresis , or radiation of the
pain , but says it is hard to catch his breath. The patient denies
orthopnea , PND , or lower extremity edema. He has never had pain at
rest. On February the patient underwent an exercise treadmill
test walking five minutes on the standard Bruce protocol , reaching
a heart rate of 96 and a blood pressure of 130/70. He had chest
pain as well as 1 mm ST depressions. Since then his angina has
occurred with less and less exertion until the morning of
admission , when he walked outside and experienced substernal chest
tightness. He again denies nausea , diaphoresis , palpitations , or
radiation of the pain , but does have some shortness of breath. The
pain lasts approximately 10-15 minutes and the patient was advised
by his cardiologist , Dr. Raymond Merrihew , to come to the Emergent
Department. In the Emergent Department he was pain free and
received aspirin and was started on heparin. EKG showed no acute
changes. CK was 47 and a troponin of 0.24.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , chronic DVTs with
pulmonary embolism x two , CVA , left temporal in the setting of an
INR of 4 , with some residual memory and expressive deficits. He is
now on Lovenox subcu for DVT prophylaxis. Chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , hepatitis B
positive , and recent eye surgery in January of 2001.
ALLERGIES: Benadryl , which causes shortness of breath.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glucophage 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Avandia 4
mg p.o. b.i.d. , atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day , aspirin 325 mg q. day ,
gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.6 , heart rate 60 , blood
pressure 110/90 , upper 70 , oxygen
saturation 98% on 2 L. In general , he is a 63-year-old Asian male ,
well appearing and in no acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal ,
round , and reactive. Extraocular muscles intact. Oral mucosa are
moist. There is no jugular venous distention , no lymphadenopathy.
Neck is supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , without
wheezes or rales. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm ,
without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , nondistended ,
and mildly tender to palpation in the epigastrium. There is no
rebound or guarding. Extremities are warm and well perfused , with
no edema.
INITIAL LABORATORIES: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 106 ,
bicarb 24 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.5 , glucose
253 , white count 5.3 , hematocrit 36.8 , platelets 144 , calcium 9.5 ,
mag 1.7 , CK 47 , troponin slightly elevated at 0.23 , INR 1.1. EKG
reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 , with normal axis and inferiorly
flattened T waves , with T in 1 , L in 6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascularly , the patient was continued
on heparin and ruled out for MI by CKs. On 10/21
he underwent cardiac catheterization , which showed an 80% proximal
LAD , 100% proximal circ , 80% proximal RCA , and 80% proximal right
PDA. His LIMA to the D2 and the LAD were patent , as was the SVG to
OM-1. The SVG to the RCA was 100% occluded. A stent was placed in
the native mid-RCA and angioplasty was undertaken of the right PDA.
After the procedure , the heparin was discontinued and he was
transitioned to Lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day for DVT prophylaxis. An
echo was obtained , which showed mildly enlarged left ventricle with
moderate reduction in function and EF of 35%. There is thinning
and hypokinesis to akinesis of the posterior and inferior segments ,
as well as hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal septum. The RV
was normal. Pulmonary artery pressures are 25+ right atrial
pressure. The patient continues to have episodes of epigastric
discomfort and belching , and his EKG revealed only nonspecific T
wave changes. He was scheduled to undergo a submax exercise
treadmill test , but this was held due to an increase in his
troponin initially from .23 to .73 , suggesting that he was having
some mild ischemia with the likely culprit being the small PDA that
had been angioplastied during cath. Recath was thought to be low
yield without anything to intervene upon after discussion with the
interventional Cardiology Service. His medical regimen was
maximized and included a beta blocker , ACE inhibitor , and nitrates.
His cardiac enzymes trended down to a CK of 32 and a troponin of
0.33 upon discharge. He underwent submaximum ETT on 3/10 and
walked for nine minutes without EKG changes , but did experience
6/10 chest pain and some belching. The test was considered
consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Of note , he
reached a max heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 142/80
during this submaximum stress test. The patient will be discharged
to home to have close follow-up with his cardiologist , Dr. Devin Peachey He will also have a follow-up stress test. He will see his
primary care physician , Dr. Panciera , for monitoring of his other
medical issues , including his diabetes. Discharge condition is
stable , discharge diet is low fat diabetic diet , and discharge
medications are enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , atenolol
50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 10 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg one

IMPRESSION: 58yo M s/p cardiac transplant c/b allograft vasculopathy ,
recent admission in 10/6 for pulmonary hemorrhage/PNA admitted with
increased SOB and hemoptysis. Likely CHF exacerbation +/- ILD +/- PNA
( CAP , atypicals , TB , PCP , fungal ). Patient's shortness of breath responded
to diuresis , and his symptoms improved. However bronchoscopy revealed
RML fresh blood , and CT chest is concerning for RML mass. Will need
follow up with pulmonary which is already arranged.
1. ) CV: No evidence of ischemia. Patient continued outpatient ASA ,
bblocker , statin , plavix. H/o cardiac transplant. Cyclosporine level on
10/27 was 152. His cyclosporine was increased during admission to 100mg po
BID. His sirolimus was discontinued.
PUMP- He was intially volume overloaded on exam. BNP on admission was 674.
He was diuresed with lasix 40mg po BID , and will be discharged on lasix
40mg po daily. Also given potassium 10meq a day , will need lytes
followed. His HCTZ was discontinued. Weight on day of discharge was
62.2kg. BP control with home regimen of dilt , lopressor , cadura.
2. ) PULM: Pulmonary was consulted. CT was negative for PE. He had a
bronchoscopy which was described above ( fresh blood oozing from RML ). BAL
was sent for multiple studies. PCP was negative , influenza negative , adeno
negative , viral studies , cultures , and cytology are pending at this time.
Galact Ag was negative. GBM antibody was negative. ANCA is pending.
Bronchoscopy and chest CT were concerning for RML mass. He will follow up
with a PET CT and Pulmonary appointment on 9/2/07. Allergy was consulted
re whether his symptoms could be an allergic pneumonitis ( given history of
ASA allergy , an previous desensitization , and they felt it was unlikely.
Rheumatology was consulted re possible vasculitis given new proteinuria -
thought unlikely although final consult recommendations were pending at
time of discharge. He will be discharged on oxygen given desat to 87% on
RA with ambulation. He will be treated empirically with levofloxacin x 14
day course to finish on 6/2/07 in case mass seen in RML is infectious.1
3. ) HEME: LENIs negative. has iron defiency anemia which will need to be
continued to follow.

ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HYPERTENSION; 2 ) HYPER-
CHOLESTEROLEMIA; 3 ) OBESITY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Alevras is a 45 year old gentle-
man with a long history of coronary
artery disease , the first admission to Sonsauon Hacent's Geka Medical Center
due to myocardial infarction was October , 1988. Coronary
angiography in 1988 revealed three vessel coronary artery disease
with ejection fraction of 45%. The next hospitalization at Lis Voylecrest Sut Medical Center in 1993 due to syncopal episode. Since the last
admission , Mr. Rodefer was doing well , essentially the same level
of symptoms. Objectively , however , there was evidence of
significant progression of coronary disease with Thallium images
suggestive of severe multivessel coronary artery disease and
developed LV dysfunction. Recent admission to Stere Mosesco Shantum Hospital Of for coronary artery catheterization and eventual
myocardial revascularization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 55 year old man , overweight. Blood
pressure 122/80 , heart rate 56 , regular.
Weight 204. Lungs clear. Jugular venous pressure not elevated at
30 degrees. Hepatojugular reflex is negative. Carotid upstroke
normal without bruits. Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs. Abdomen
obese , but otherwise benign. Peripheral pulses are intact
throughout. No pitting edema.
LABORATORY VALUES: White count 7 , 000 , hematocrit 42% ,
184 platelets. BUN 24 , creatinine
1.1 , 1.0 , glucose 101 and sodium 139 , potassium 4.4. PT 12.9 , PTT
25.4 , INR 1.2. EKG - sinus bradycardia and inferior myocardial
infarction. Cardiac catheterization report from the 25 of October ,
1995 revealed coronary artery disease with total occlusion of the
left anterior descending artery in its proximal portion , left
circumflex artery is small , non dominant and large obtuse marginal
branch and the right coronary artery totally occluded in its mid
portion. The left ventriculogram revealed markedly enlarged
ventricle with inferior hypokinesis and apical akinesis.
Calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 46%.
OPERATION: Coronary bypass to anterior
descending and posterior descending
arteries on the 22 of February , 1995 , surgeon was Dr. Bohs
POSTOPERATIVE COURSE: The patient was extubated on the
first postoperative day and
transferred to the ward. Further postoperative course was
uneventful so the patient could be discharged in good postoperative
condition on the fifth ( 5th ) postoperative day.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old lady with
known history of coronary artery
disease , who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x three in
1989 , with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal , and
saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery. In the last
four months , she experienced chest tightness and dyspnea on
exertion , and during the last month , her fatigue was extreme. The
patient was admitted on 7/22/96 to Missi.ell Hospital where an
echocardiogram revealed low-normal ejection fraction with severe
aortic stenosis and mild aortic insufficiency. Aortic valve area
was calculated on 0.8 square centimeters. Cardiac catheterization ,
performed in the same hospital , revealed an ejection fraction of
66% with normal pulmonary artery pressures , aortic valve area of
0.6 square centimeters , and gradient across the valve of 44 mm
of Hg. Native coronary artery disease showed 70% stenosis of the
left main , occluded left anterior descending , 50% stenosis of the
obtuse marginal , and 70% stenosis of the right coronary arteries.
The graft to the left anterior descending and to to the OM1 were
patent. The saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery was
occluded.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. Micronase. Lasix
40 mg q. d. Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.

Discharge Date: 11/2/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Atrial flutter. 2. Congestive heart
failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67-year-old male with
a history of congestive heart failure
and history of atrial flutter in September of 1998. The patient was
admitted to Cardiology for treatment of atrial flutter and
worsening congestive heart failure. The patient initially
presented to Aler Hospital in September of 1998 with
acute shortness of breath and atrial flutter. Chest x-ray at that
time showed congestive heart failure. The patient was initially
rate controlled with Verapamil and Digoxin and converted to normal
sinus rhythm. However , on Digoxin , the patient developed
junctional tachycardia , which reverted back to normal sinus rhythm
after Digoxin was discontinued. Echocardiogram at that time showed
an ejection fraction of 35%. The patient was discharged on 11 of May
in normal sinus rhythm. The patient was discharged on Lopressor ,
Verapamil , Aspirin , and Coumadin , which was stopped five months
ago. The patient did extremely well after discharge until about
five days ago when he ran out of his Atenolol , which he had not
taken since then. Over the past week , the patient had extreme
fatigue and dyspnea on exertion , which steadily worsened. Today ,
the patient was taking out the trash and experienced a few seconds
of chest heaviness on the left side , without any radiation. The
patient reported being short of breath , but had no other symptoms.
Upon trying to the mailbox , the patient was extremely short of
breath and fell to the ground , but had no loss of consciousness.
There was no warning or dizziness. The patient was brought to
Tien Medical Center Emergency Department. There , the patient was
noted to be in atrial flutter at a rate of 150. The patient was
given IV Lopressor , 5 mg , and his heart rate came down to 106.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A review of systems was positive for three
pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and increasing
lower extremity swelling over the past week. The patient denied
any fever , chills , night sweats , or change in bowel movements.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history was significant for
high blood pressure , left ankle and left knee arthritis ,
questionable history of gout , gonococcal urethritis ,
diverticulosis , elevated cholesterol , and cardiomyopathy with
ejection fraction of 35% by echocardiogram in September of 1998.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS
ON ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patient was on
Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day , Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q. day ,
Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day , which the patient self discontinued
five days prior to admission , Lisinopril 20 mg q. day , Aspirin ,
B12 , Folate , and Multivitamins. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient's
social history was significant for tobacco , one pack per day for
forty years. The patient quit in February of 1998. Alcohol was
significant for two to three drinks per day , with none since
September of 1998. There was no history of drug use. The patient
lives in Derdflintvo alone. The patient is a retired social worker.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's family history was significant for a
mother with a myocardial infarction at 60 , brother with myocardial
infarction at 54 , and father who is deceased from cerebrovascular
accident.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , the patient was
afebrile. The heart rate was 115 , blood
pressure 150/100 , and saturation 95% on 2 liters. In general , the
patient was alert and oriented and in no acute distress. HEENT
revealed the patient to be normocephalic , atraumatic. The pupils
were equal , round and reactive to light. The extraocular movements
were intact. The oropharynx was moist. The neck was supple
without bruits. The chest was clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a 1/6 holosystolic murmur. The
patient was in atrial flutter. The abdominal examination was
benign. The extremities showed 1+ edema bilaterally. There was no
clubbing or cyanosis. Electrocardiogram on admission showed atrial
flutter at rate of 50 , as well as left axis deviation , right bundle
branch block , left ventricular hypertrophy with QRS widening , old
inferior myocardial infarction , and right bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion ,
consistent with congestive heart failure , and bilateral pleural
effusions.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data on admission showed sodium 146 ,
potassium 4.4 , creatinine 1.2 , white blood cell
count 6.7 , hematocrit 42.5 , CK 95 , and troponin 0.05.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology floor
for treatment of atrial flutter and congestive
heart failure. The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction. It was felt that the patient's worsening congestive
heart failure was likely secondary to his flutter. The patient was
started on Lasix in addition to being started on a beta blocker.
However , the patient remained in atrial flutter with poor rate
control. Echocardiogram on 7 of September showed an ejection fraction of
30-35% with global hypokinesis. Of note , also , the patient's
ventricular myocardium showed an echo bright appearance consistent
with possible infiltrative disease. On 14 of October , the patient
underwent cardioversion without complications , as he was still in
atrial flutter and was not having good rate control. The patient
was successfully cardioverted and remained in sinus rhythm
afterwards. However , on 23 of May , the patient was still significantly
short of breath and hypoxic. This was felt probably likely
secondary to fluid overload , and the patient was started on Lasix.
However , the patient underwent a VQ scan and was ruled out for
pulmonary embolism. The patient did well and , on 6 of April , the patient
experienced bilateral lip swelling , consistent with angioedema.
The patient's Lasix and Captopril were discontinued , as it was
unclear which agent had caused this , however , it was most likely
the Captopril. This responded well to Benadryl. The patient was
started on ethacrynic acid and Hydralazine for diuresis and
afterload reduction. The patient did well on this regimen. On
26 of February , the patient was discharged home in stable condition. The
patient was in sinus rhythm and was satting well on room air.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patient
was on Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg
inhaled q. 4-6 hours as needed for wheezing , Enteric coated aspirin
325 mg p.o. q. day , Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day , Edecrin 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day , Hydralazine 10 mg p.o. q.i.d. ,
Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q. day , and
Benadryl 50 mg p.o. q. 6 hours as needed for lip swelling.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr. Kotow
in one week. DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with
services , to be followed by Aflintsa Mo Hendco VNA for blood pressure and
weight checks q.o.d.

ATTENDING: TRENTHAM , DEL GUADALUPE MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Klaja is an 81-year-old gentleman
whose chief complaint was abdominal pain and diarrhea. He had a
past medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and recent
complex medical history including a septic right knee arthritis
with MRSA complicated by a PICC line-induced right upper extremity
DVT followed by bacteremia with multi-resistant Klebsiella
pneumoniae , treated with meropenem for 14 days with the course
ending on 11/11/2006. The patient presented with left lower quadrant abdominal
pain during his last admission 2 weeks ago associated with low-volume mucus
diarrhea , C. diff toxin assay was at that time negative on 1/24
Abdominal CT showed diverticulosis with stranding of the sigmoid colon.
Blood cultures grew klebsiella , treated with 14 days of meropenem
as previously noted. However , since this discharge , the mild
abdominal pain persisted. He continues to have low-grade mucus
diarrhea about 5 times a day , not associated with fever , chills
or anorexia. Over the last 2 days prior to this admission , the
diarrhea became high volume , still nonbloody and not associated
again with fever or chills. He was brought into the emergency
department at which time , he was afebrile with a blood pressure
of 85/49 , heart rate in the 80s , respiratory rate of 20 , O2
saturation 93% on room air. At that time , he received volume
resuscitation with 2 liters of IV fluids , stool samples for C.
diff assay were sent. He received empiric therapy with p.o.
vancomycin. An abdominal CT in the emergency department showed
thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectum.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease as noted
with an anterior MI in 2003 , that had complicated to VT arrest ,
status post CABG in 2003 that was a left internal mammary artery
to LAD with saphenous vein graft to the PTA and obtuse marginal.
He has had a catheterization in 3/12 that showed patent grafts
and drug-eluting stent to the left circumflex. He has chronic
kidney disease , baseline creatinine between 1.3 and 1.5 ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , C. diff colitis in 2003 , BPH ,
asthma , GERD , status post right upper extremity PICC-related DVT
and right knee septic arthritis.
MEDICATIONS: aspirin 81 mg , Plavix 75 mg , Coumadin 5 mg , digoxin 0.125 mg ,
Lasix 49 mg daily , lisinopril 10 mg daily , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 80 mg
daily , Flomax 0.4 mg daily and Flovent 110 mcg b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: penicillin which caused hives and swelling.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He previously a smoker. He does not drink. He
is a nursing home resident.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease , two
brothers who had coronary artery disease in their 60s. No family
history of cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vitals as previous noted , blood pressure
in the 80s/49 , heart rate 80 , regular , respiratory rate 20 , O2
saturation 93% on room air. Patient was afebrile. Pertinent
physical findings included: Pulmonary: He had a prolonged
expiratory phase , but no crackles. Cardiovascular: Distant heart
sounds , regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No rubs or
gallops. Systolic ejection or murmur 3/6 at the left lower
sternal border. Abdomen: Obese , distended abdomen , left lower
quadrant tenderness to palpation. No rebound at this time.
Extremities are warm , 2+ pulses with 1+ bilateral lower extremity
edema to the shins. Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3 , cranial
nerves grossly intact , no abnormalities.
admission abdominal CT showed bowel wall thickening in
the descending sigmoid colon and rectum. Chest x-ray showed
left-sided pleural effusion , atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs were significant for a white count of
15.7 , hematocrit of 35.5 and INR of 3.2. Electrolytes were
normal.
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU for hypertension and
infectious etiology. He was stabilized there and transferred to
the floor within a few days.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Colitis , presumed infectious etiology , descending and sigmoid
colon. Colitis was worse over the last month , associated with
diarrhea. Abdominal CT is consistent with an infectious
inflammatory bowel process. Given history of C. diff colitis , C.
diff was the most likely infectious etiology , but others were
possible. Ischemic colitis was considered secondary to low
forward flow , given patient's cardiomyopathy and low ejection
fraction of 20% to 35% and he also got a pattern of inflammatory
colitis or nonspecific colitis. Stool samples were sent for a C.
diff toxin and assay and all were negative x at least 3 samples.
Stool cultures were sent and did not grow anything out during
admission. Empiric treatment was started with p.o. vancomycin.
Patient's abdominal pain continued to improve and completely
resolved. By discharge , patient remained afebrile and white
blood cell count decreased. Advance patient's diet as tolerated
and by discharge the patient was up to soft solids. We added
lactobacillus p.o. for probiotics and patient also had flex sig
two days before discharge , showing resolving inflammation
consistent with colitis of inflammatory etiology. The flex sig
did not change his management. We did discharge the patient on a
2-week course p.o. vancomycin alone.
2. Coronary artery disease. Patient had no evidence for acute
coronary syndrome on admission. We continued his aspirin ,
Plavix , statin and beta-blocker. Patient had no ischemic issues
or coronary artery disease issues during his admission.
3. CHF. Patient has previous EF noted at 20% to 35% , so a
gentle hydration therapy at first in the MICU for hypertension
and then as patient's blood pressure increased , was able to
restart patient's Lasix dose in order to diurese all of the extra
fluid gained during the rehydration therapy , was restarted on the
Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily , his daily dose at home. Also considered
restarting lisinopril , but deferred discharge to outpatient
follow up with primary care physician for restart of lisinopril ,
once patient is fully recovered.
4. Chronic kidney disease. Patient had a baseline of creatinine
1.2 to 1.5 and he came into the hospital with a creatinine of 1.0.
The patient was below baseline and remained below baseline during
admission. He did not have any renal issues.
5. Hematology. Patient has a history a line-induced DVT , has
been treated with Coumadin , with no definitive evidence as to how
along patient should be treated , given that the DVT was line
induced. Coumadin was therapeutic on admission , became
supertherapeutic in the MICU. Held Coumadin until INR fell below
3 , restarted Coumadin afterwards at 6 mg p.o. daily , patient's
normal dose. Patient was therapeutic on discharge. Will follow
up with primary care physician for Coumadin monitoring.
6. Nutrition. Patient was in the MICU and was n.p.o. given
abdominal pain and colitis. When transferred to floor , was
started on liquid diet and advanced to soft solid diet. By
discharge , the patient did not have abdominal pain and most of
the diarrhea had resolved.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED: The patient had a flexible sigmoidoscopy
during the admission that showed colitis consistent with
inflammatory etiology.
DIAGNOSIS: Patient had repeated negative C. diff toxin assays ,
but colitis was presumed to be C. diff and given history , could
have been other infectious or inflammatory etiologies. Patient
continued to improve on vancomycin and thus was discharged with
presumed C. diff colitis diagnosis.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Included aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , Plavix
75 mg p.o. daily , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily , Nexium 20 mg p.o.
daily , Flovent 110 mcg inhale b.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily ,
lactobacillus 2 tabs p.o. t.i.d. , metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
simvastatin 80 mg p.o. at bed time , Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. every
evening , vancomycin 250 mg p.o. every 6 hours x8 days at
discharge and Coumadin 5 mg p.o. every evening.
Patient had to follow up with primary care physician , setup for 2
to 3 weeks after discharge.

glucose 114 , total protein 4.9 , amylase 16 , LDH 38. There were 756
white blood cells on differential , of which 93% macrophages and 7%
mesothelioma cells , 127 , 000 red blood cells , and the fluid was
grossly blood. Cultures from the fluid were negative for bacteria
and fungal growth. Gram stain showed no organisms , no
polymorphonuclear cells. Vancomycin was redosed to 1 gram every 48
hours secondary to increased creatinine and elevated levels. Given
his recent requirement for debridement , vancomycin will be
continued for 2 weeks after discharge. Ofloxacin will also be
continued for the same. All cultures from this hospitalization are
negative to date.
2. Cardiovascular. The patient ruled out for myocardial
infarction. VQ scan was low probability on admission. This was
performed secondary to his baseline tachycardia. Lower extremity
noninvasive studies and ultrasound were done and were negative for
deep vein thrombosis. The patient's triponin on admission was 0.0.
The patient was aggressively diuresed as a component of his initial
dyspnea on exertion was likely secondary to a degree of congestive
heart failure. His admission weight was 100.6 kilograms , and
weight on discharge was 95.8 kilograms. With aggressive diuresis
during hospitalization , Lasix was discontinued on the day prior to
discharge. Digoxin level on admission was 0.6 , on discharge was
1.0. The patient had several episodes of hypotension with systolic
blood pressure in the mid 70's to low 80's. Captopril and
Lopressor were decreased and held at certain stages during his
hospitalization. On discharge , he was on a stable dose of
Captopril , 6.25 milligrams 3 times a day , and Lopressor , 12.5
milligrams twice a day. He was not orthostatic on the day prior to
discharge.
3. Renal. The patient was aggressively diuresed. His BUN and
creatinine rose from 12 and 1.2 on admission , to a peak of 36 and
2.6 on 20 of November Subsequently , the creatinine has declined , and on
9 of July , BUN was 37 , creatinine 2.2. The patient had an
eosinophilia , which peaked at 18% on 16 of March , and subsequently
decreased to 11% on discharge. Urine eosinophils were not present.
It appeared that his eosinophilia was related to ceftazidime , which
was discontinued on 24 of January It is unlikely that his increasing
renal insufficiency is secondary to acute tubular necrosis. More
likely , it is secondary to the aggressive diuresis undertaken to
decrease his congestive heart failure. Follow-up laboratory values
will likely reveal improvement in BUN and creatinine status , as
well as a decrease in his peripheral eosinophilia.
4. Psychiatry. The patient has had anxiety , especially at night ,
and has been treated successfully with Ativan , but Serax resulted
in nightmares. The patient has a history of depression and may
benefit from counseling. The patient's decreased oral intake ,
nightmares , and anxiety may all be related to an underlying
depressive component over his prolonged illness.
5. Endocrine. The patient's blood sugar levels have been well
controlled on a regimen of NPH , 20 each morning. He has not
required any additional coverage , and regular insulin coverage has
been discontinued for 2 days.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is fair. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE are Tylenol , 650 milligrams by mouth every
4 hours as needed for headache , enteric-coated aspirin , 325
milligrams by mouth each day , Captopril , 6.25 milligrams by mouth
every 8 hours , held if systolic blood pressure is less than 85 ,
digoxin , 0.125 milligrams by mouth each day , Benadryl , 25 to 50
milligrams by mouth every 4 hours as needed for itching , Colace ,
100 milligrams by mouth twice a day , NPH insulin , 20 units
subcutaneously each morning , Atrovent inhaler , 2 puffs 4 times a
day , Ativan , 0.5 to 1 milligram by mouth every 6 hours as needed
for anxiety and insomnia , Lopressor , 12.5 milligrams by mouth twice
a day , held for systolic blood pressure less than 80 or heart rate
less than 60 , Niferex , 150 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
Percocet , 1 or 2 tablets by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain ,
Sarna lotion topically to back as needed , vancomycin , 1 gram
intravenously every 48 hours times 10 days , Axid , 150 milligrams by
mouth twice a day , ofloxacin , 200 milligrams by mouth twice a day
times 7 days.
The patient will be transferred to Manhill County Hospital
on 5 of September He will have a FOLLOW-UP appointment with Dr. Andaverde
in approximately 2 weeks.

history of ischemic cardiomyopathy
dating back several years. He developed angina in 1983 and
underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with a LIMA to LAD ,
SVG to the diag 1 , OM1 and PDA. He did relatively well after that
and then developed dyspnea on exertion. He underwent cardiac
catheterization in 3/5 but only the SVG to the PDA was diffusely
diseased. He then had a myocardial infarction in October of 1999
and apparently underwent another coronary artery bypass graft at
the Mitho General Health The anatomy of this is unknown. He felt
well postoperatively , but began to develop shortness of breath and
orthopnea in the last few months. He denies any chest pain ,
palpitations or syncope and is sometimes dizzy when he walks. He
is not admitted for optimization , his medications , tailored
therapy , and a transplant evaluation.

Discharge Date: 5/25/1996
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Jerrold Koterba is a 78 year old
gentleman with known coronary artery
disease who underwent coronary artery catheterization one month
prior to the most recent admission , and was found to have two
vessel coronary artery disease. The medical treatment was
attempted following cardiac catheterization which has not
eliminated his angina. He was admitted to the hospital with
unstable angina after conservative therapy. On echocardiogram from
July , 1996 , he had a moderately depressed left ventricular
function and ejection fraction of 45 percent. Coronary
catheterization showed 90 percent stenosis of the left anterior
descending coronary artery , occluded circumflex artery , and mild
disease of his right coronary artery.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: The patient is a well-appearing
78 year old gentleman. Head
and neck supple. No bruits over the carotid arteries. Heart , S1
and S2 are clear , no murmurs. The lungs with discrete wheezes over
both sides. The abdomen is soft , non-tender , benign , no
organomegaly. Extremities , no edema , no varicosities.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass
grafting x two with reverse vein graft to the
second obtuse marginal graft and the left anterior descending
coronary artery on July , 1996 , the surgeon was Dr. Avenia The
patient's postoperative recovery in the Intensive Care Unit was
uncomplicated. The patient was extubated on the first
postoperative day and transferred to the Floor. Further recovery
on the Floor was not associated with any significant complications.
The patient regained a significant level of his preoperative
physical activity , and was able to be discharged out of the
hospital on May , 1996 in stable postoperative condition on the
following medications.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg q.d.; Lasix 40 mg q.d.;
insulin 60 units q.a.m.; metoprolol 50 mg

ATTENDING: BURT EVERETT PENISSON M.D.
DISCHARGE DATE: To be determined.
SERVICE: GMS Ra
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Failure to thrive.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure ,
hypercholesterolemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , venous
stasis , postherpetic neuralgia , atrial fibrillation , and urinary
tract infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 87-year-old female with a
history of congestive heart failure , atrial fibrillation status
post pacemaker placement , and chronic venous stasis who presents
with nausea , vomiting , and failure to thrive. The patient was
recently admitted to Tapo Waycent Smouthnew Community Hospital in early
October with a congestive heart failure exacerbation and lower
extremity cellulitis. She was treated with diuresis ( ultimately
with ethacrynic acid as she developed a rash on torsemide and
itching with Lasix ) and a seven-day course of levofloxacin. At
the end of this admission , she was sent to a rehabilitation
facility. The patient had returned on the day of admission to
see her primary care physician. She had been vomiting and
appears severely dehydrated. She reported nausea and vomiting
for eight to nine days , intermittent nonbloody , nonbilious. She
also reported dysphagia for the last two months. She describes
recent dysuria. She also states that she has had no bowel
movement for a week prior to admission. She has had flatus. She
also complains of a baseline right ear pain due to her
postherpetic neuralgia. She has significantly decreased p.o.
intake with increasing generalized weakness. She denies chest
pain or shortness of breath.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure ,
hypercholesterolemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , venous
stasis , T6 fracture and lower back pain , history of herpes zoster
with postherpetic neuralgia affecting the right face and ear ,
atrial fibrillation status post pace replacement , and history of
guaiac-positive stools.
MEDICATIONS: Colace , senna , lisinopril 5 mg q. day , Lopressor 25
mg b.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pain , OxyContin 10 mg
q.12h. , calcium 500 mg t.i.d. , Neurontin 100 mg b.i.d. , Fosamax
70 mg q. week , Protonix 40 mg q. day , and ethacrynic acid 25 mg
b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Lasix , torsemide , penicillin , erythromycin , capsicum ,
and quinidine.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Recently at the Orva Sonapa Alblands in
ME , otherwise , lives alone in Rham En Ma At baseline is
ambulatory with a walker. Remote history of tobacco , quit 50
years ago. No history of alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Asthma and heart disease in three brothers.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 96 , heart rate
81 , blood pressure 119/56 , respiratory rate of 20 , O2 sat 99% on
room air. The patient is alert , but uncomfortable and ill
appearing. HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact. Mucous membranes are dry.
Oropharynx is otherwise clear. There is ptosis of the right lid
( baseline ) and exquisite tenderness over the right base and right
ear. Neck: JVP is 7 cm. Neck is otherwise supple with no
tenderness to palpation. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Lungs are clear
to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft , nontender ,
nondistended with normal active bowel sounds. Foley in place
draining a dark , cloudy urine. Extremities: Violaceous skin
changes of the legs bilaterally. 2+ edema. There is an area of
erythema in the left medial great toe , but no evidence of
infected ulceration. Neuro: Alert and oriented x3. Cranial
nerves intact ( except right lid ptosis ). The patient did not
feel well enough to cooperate with a full neurologic exam , but
her strength was symmetric throughout.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for a chemistry panel within
normal limits. BUN was 22 , creatinine 1.1 , white count was
13.27 , hematocrit 41.4 , platelets 448 , 000 , ALT 25 , AST 35 ,
alkaline phosphatase 339 , total bilirubin 1.0 , albumin 4.0 ,
amylase 39 , and lipase 14.
IMPRESSION: An 87-year-old female presenting with nausea ,
vomiting , and dehydration as well as dysuria , most likely mainly
due to urinary tract infection secondary to chronic Foley
placement.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: No acute issues. The patient was continued on her
beta-blocker. No aspirin was given , as the patient is on
Coumadin and has a history of guaiac-positive stool.
b. Pump: The patient was dry on admission in the setting of
nausea , vomiting , and decreased p.o. intake. Her last echo
showed an EF of 55% presumed diastolic dysfunction ,
mild-to-moderate MR as well as pulmonary hypertension of unclear
etiology ( pulmonary artery pressure was 64 mmHg plus right atrial
pressure ). Initially , the patient's ethacrynic acid was held
given dehydration , but was restarted towards the end of her
admission and titrated out to b.i.d. dosing to maintain a
slightly negative fluid balance. The patient was also continued
on her beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor after she was adequately
hydrated for blood pressure control.
c. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. She has a pacer placed and is V-paced. She is on
Coumadin with her INR at goal.
2. Pulmonary: The admission chest x-ray was read as a streaky
opacity of the right lung base possibly representing an
infiltrate , but curve has been artifact due to low lung volume.
The patient had no clinical evidence of pneumonia ( no cough , lung
exam clear ).
3. GI: The patient had nausea , vomiting for several days prior
to admission with decreased p.o. intake. She also reported no
bowel movement in the last weeks prior to admission. A KUB was
obtained on admission , which showed no evidence of obstruction or
free air. The patient was given stool softeners and laxatives
p.r.n. and began to have her regular bowel movements. She was
continued on Nexium for her history of gastroesophageal reflux
disease. The patient's nausea and vomiting improved overall
throughout her admission , however , intermittently returned.
There is no clear cause for this nausea and vomiting , but it was
thought likely to be a contribution of her opioid medications ,
which were increased early on in her hospitalization to address
her postherpetic neuralgia. The patient's nausea improved with
Reglan. Nausea , vomiting was improved on the day of discharge.
The patient had significantly better p.o. intake. The patient
also complained of dysphagia for two months prior to admission ,
this occurred mainly with solid foods. Per Speech and Swallow ,
the patient was initially on a soft mechanical/thin liquid diet
and is concerned for an obstructive lesion. A video swallow was
obtained on 3/4/05. This study showed no aspiration and normal
passage of fluid of varying consistencies ( although a note was
made of cricopharyngeal prominence ). Speech and Swallow
recommended a minced solid/thin liquid diet , which the patient
has tolerated well. The patient has a history of an elevated
alkaline phosphatase ( with elevated GGT ) of unclear etiology.
Abdominal ultrasound on her last admission in October 2005
showed gallstones , but no other process to explain the
abnormalities in alkaline phosphatase. The patient had no right
upper quadrant pain on this admission.
4. Renal/FEN: The patient was initially given intravenous
fluids for dehydration. She was also found to have a urinary
tract infection and was initially started on levofloxacin
empirically. The urine culture returned was Staph aureus ( the
patient has had indwelling Foley ) and the patient was switched to
doxycycline ( the patient is allergic to sulfa drugs , penicillin ,
and erythromycin ). Blood cultures were negative. The patient
has been afebrile through this admission. She was also noted to
have a urinary retention on a few occasions where an attempt was
made to remove her Foley catheter. This was thought most likely
due to urinary tract infection and to use opioid medications.
The patient will be discharged to rehab with her Foley in place
and is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Urology on
October , 2005.
5. Neuro: The patient has postherpetic neuralgia affecting her
right face/ear. She was admitted on OxyContin and oxycodone ,
which was titrated out in an attempt to make her more comfortable
and Neurontin was also titrated out with good effect on her pain.
Given her nausea and urinary retention , the patient's opioid
medications were decreased. A trial of a lidoderm patch on the
affected area was attempted prior to discharge.
6. Heme: The patient's INR was at goal ( 2 to 3 ) on Coumadin for
her history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was on Nexium and Coumadin.
8. Code status: DNR/DNI.
9. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility. She will follow up with her primary
care doctor Dr. Eddie Nitterhouse In addition , an appointment has
been made for her to see Dr. Nang on January , 2005 at 9:30
a.m. In addition , an appointment has been made with Dr. Storch
in Neurology on October , 2005 at 11:15 a.m. and it is requested
that the patient's basic metabolic panel be monitored while she
is on ethacrynic acid. In addition , her weight should be
followed daily to check for fluid accumulation. She will also
benefit from physical therapy as she is deconditioned. The
patient is stable at the time of this dictation.
The discharge medications will be dictated in an addendum to this
discharge summary.

a history of chronic renal insufficiency , elevated ammonia levels
chronically , CAD , ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40% in
LVH , recently discharged from Longlate General Medical Center on 7/10
and subsequently transferred to Ieu University Medical Center The patient
presents with increased shortness of breath. The prior admission
was related to renal failure and increased encepholopathy ( no
dictated summary available ). The patient reported doing well in
rehab for several days. However , over the past 2-3 days the
patient developed increased shortness of breath , and dyspnea on
exertion with very minimal movement. The patient reports stable
two pillow orthopnea. No upper respiratory symptoms. No fevers ,
chills , nausea or vomiting. The patient without palpitation.
The patient does report that shortness of breath was increased
over past baseline. The patient also notes noted increased
hematuria , although the patient has had a chronic hematuria for
over 1-2 years per patient. The patient does report that he had
a Foley in during the prior admission , and has had increased
hematuria since that discharge. The patient denies chest pain.
The patient was felt to have ""crackles"" at the rehab , and was
sent to the Ridwill Child for further care. In ED
the patient was afebrile , heart rate of 74 , blood pressure
127/75 , and satting 95% on room air. He was given 80 IV Lasix ,

LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 103 , CO2
26 , BUN 64 , creatinine 4.0 ( baseline creatinine of 3.7 - 3.9 ) ,
albumin 3.4 , white count of 7.1 , hematocrit of 33.5 , platelets of
137 , ( baseline hematocrit usually 32-35 ) , LFTs within normal
limits ( ALT , AST , alk phos , T bili ). First set of ED enzymes
were negative. BNP elevated at 655. Ammonia elevated at 83.
INR 1.2 , PTT 36.
Chest x-ray revealed enlarged central pulmonary arteries which
were suggestive of pulmonary hypertension in this patient with
obstructive sleep apnea , left base subsegmental atelectasis. EKG
first degree AV block , left axis deviation , a left ??anticular??
vesicular block , no ST or T-wave changes. UA with 3+ blood ,
15-20 white blood cells , trace bacterial. Of note , renal
ultrasound on 9/29/03 ( prior admission )I revealed no
hydronephrosis , distended gallbladder with multiple small stones.
ETT MIBI on 9/14/03 stress images only performed revealed small
area of myocardial scar in mid LAD/diagonal territory with
moderate stress induced peri-infarct ischemia. Echo performed
2/25/03 revealed an EF of 45-50% , positive LVH. Inferior and
lateral hypokinesis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Ischemia: The patient with a history of CAD and positive
MIBI in 10/10 The patient with no EKG changes , and also no
chest pain. The patient initially continued on aspirin , beta
blocker and a statin. On 8/25/03 the patient with a troponin
leak ( peak of .84 ) which subsequently trended down. The patient
also had had a prior troponin leak prior to the previously
described MIBI. At that time cardiology was following and
recommended medical management secondary to difficulty with
aggressive intervention in this patient. For this admission ,
cardiology was again consulted and cardiology recommended doing a
repeat MIBI to assess. The MIBI was completed on 3/28/03 and
results are pending at the time of this dictation. Again , very
difficult to perform intervention secondary to habitus.
Continued aspirin , beta blocker and statin. To follow up with
Cardiology for further read of the MIBI test. Pump: The patient
with elevated BNP and some fluid overload. Chest x-ray as
described above ( also a question of small pleural effusion slowly
improved from before ). It was felt that the patient's shortness
of breath could be secondary to increased pulmonary edema. So ,
the patient's Lasix was increased to 80 mg p.o. t.i.d. ( from
b.i.d. dosing ). Prior echo is as described above , revealing an
EF of 45%. The patient did have successful diuresis on the
increased Lasix dosing. On 1/24 the Lasix was lowered back to
b.i.d. dosing since the patient's creatinine began to rise.
Creatinine normalized to patient's baseline on 10/14 At time of
discharge the patient is on a home regimen of Lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d. Rhythm: The patient with a history of VT and the patient
was continued on sotalol , and monitored on telemetry without
alarms.
2. Pulmonary: The patient with shortness of breath increased
over baseline and chest x-ray as described above. Secondary to
the elevated BNP and increased lower extremity edema , the patient
was diuresed as described above. The patient does use BiPAP at
night for obstructive sleep apnea.
3. Endocrine: The patient with diabetes on insulin sliding
scale and a.m. NPH. No ace inhibitor was added secondary to the
significantly elevated creatinine. The patient's NPH was
increased to 10 units q.a.m. secondary to elevated sugars
( resulting in more improved glycemic control ).
4. Renal: The patient with chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of approximately 4. This is likely secondary
to several factors , including diabetes , effects of paraprotein
associated with monoclonal gammopathy ( obesity ). The patient was
continued on Phoslo , Calcitriol and Epogen. The patient also
with increased hematuria , and this was discussed with urology.
Previously extensive urological workup ( including cystoscopy ) was
largely negative but were poor studies secondary to large
habitus. Urology attending was not comfortable with aggressive
intervention at this time , and thought hematuria was likely
secondary to significant BPH ( and associated engorged veins ).
The patient is status post Targis procedure as described above ,
and hematuria secondary to recent Foley trauma from past
admission. The patient to follow up with urology in the future.
A urine cytology was obtained and is pending at this time.
5. GI: The patient with elevated ammonia levels , with normal
LFTs. This has also been worked up in the past according to the
patient which resulted in no clear diagnosis. The patient is too
obese for any abdominal imaging per CT. The patient does have a
history of multiple myeloma which could be the source of elevated
ammonia , versus a hepatic source. Ammonium level was 83. The
patient had no asterixis and had normal mentation while inhouse.
The patient's medication of Lactulose was continued.
6. Heme: The patient with chronic anemia as described in the
lab section. The patient did have an episode of epistaxis that
subsequently resolved , and hematuria as described above , though
also somewhat improved at time of discharge. Hematocrit was
stable throughout this , and there was no need for transfusion.
7. Oncology: The patient with a history of IgA monoclonal
gammopathy status post Cytoxan therapy. The oncologist
attending , Dr. Burrows , who knows the patient felt there was
no need for additional chemo at this time. Previous Cytoxan
therapy has not been significantly effective.
8. Neuro: The patient also complaining of muscle weakness ,
proximal muscles greater than distal muscles. A neurology
consult was called , who felt that this was largely secondary to
deconditioning and secondary to patient's multiple comorbidities ,
this is not likely secondary to a myositis. No further workup
was performed.
PLAN TO DO: The patient to be discharged to rehabilitation for
further care , physical therapy and medical management. The
patient to follow up with Cardiology , PCP and Urology. Continue
wound care dressing changes b.i.d.

207. Cardiac enzymes neg x2 EKG: LBBB , unchanged from 10/4 , not
present on 8/28
Hospital Course:
CV: Based on exam and labs , the patient was felt to be in mild CHF
on admission. She was Rule out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes
x3. Trans-thoracic Echo was done which showed EF of 50-55% with
hypokinesis of anterior and antero-septal wall. Tissue dopplers
suggested diastolic dysfunction , no valvular abnormalities except
trace TR. The patient was started on an ACEI for better BP control ,
no betablocker given h/o asthma. On statin , increased dose to
simvastatin 80. TSH negative. The patient responded well to Lasix IV
diuresis and felt that her breathing was back to baseline after two
days of diuresis.
Pulm: The patient has a history of asthma and OSA; she was continued
on nebs , MDI , O2. Recieved 1 dose of steroids in ED , but these were
not continued since her presentation was more consistent with CHF.
The patient needs CPAP at night , but does not take this at home
since she lost her CPAP machine.
Renal: The patient has a hx of CRI ( 1.5-2.1 ) due to diabetes , her
creatinine was stable between 1.7-1.9 during her admission with
diuresis and the addition of the ACE inhibitor.
HEME: The patient was anemic with a Hct of about 28 on admission. Iron
studies sent which showed Fe of 23 and TIBC of 367 ( transferrin sat
approx 6% ) This is consistent with Fe deficient anemia. The patient's
Hct subsequently dropped to 24.5 with slightly guaiac pos stool and she
was transfused 2u PRBC with resulting Hct 29.9. The patient has a
family hx of colon cancer and she recently missed colonoscopy in July .
Should reschedule as an outpatient to start w/u for Fe def
anemia and guaiac pos stools.
Endo: The patietn has a hx of poorly controlled DM2 in the past with
HgbA1c as high as 12 , HbA1c was repeated and found to be 7.2%.
Diabetes management service was consulted and recommended continuation
of Lantus at 70u QAM with adjustment in Humalog sliding scale. The
patietn should be scheduled for follow up with diabetes clinic as
an outpatient. The patient has significant neuropathic pain in her
feet due to diabetic neuropathy , has been unable to obtain neurontin
from tion hospital , pain currently managed on a PRN basis with occ
oxycodone at night.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You should take all of your medications as directed by your doctors.
It is very important to visit your doctors for follow up to make sure
that your diabetes , blood pressure , and heart failure are under
control. If you have additional trouble breathing or chest pain or any
other emergency , do not hesitate to return to the emergency room.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Follow up with diabetes management service
2. Follow up for colonoscopy to w/u Fe deficient anemia

ATTENDING: PAWELEK , BENTON FREDERIC MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease , CHF , EF of 15% status
post AVR , history of NSTEMI initially presenting to outside
hospital on 8/19/06 with chief complaint of shortness of breath ,
found to be volume overloaded with a clinical exam and laboratory
findings consistent with heart failure. The patient was found to
have a BNP of 747 as well as a troponin I of 0.43. A repeat echo
at that time revealed an EF of 15% , down from a previous EF of 25
to 35% with a functional aortic valve , moderate-to-severe mitral
insufficiency. A persantine MIBI demonstrated left ventricular
enlargement and three-vessel disease with ischemia in the mid
distal LAD and left circ territory as well as a fixed inferior
wall defect consistent with a right coronary artery infarct. The
patient was diuresed , started on Carvedilol and improved.
Troponins trended down. The patient continued to have frequent
runs of ectopy and SVT. The patient was placed on a heparin drip
and transferred to the Acbroadl Hospital for
catheterization and possible percutaneous intervention. On
admission , the patient reported to be feeling much better , denied
shortness of breath or chest pain. The patient reports
progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past several months ,
inability to lay flat , positive orthopnea and PND , reports
ability to climb two flights of stairs , also reports occasional
palpitations. No fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , constipation ,
diarrhea , bright red blood per rectum or pedal edema. The
patient reports poor compliance with diabetes management , denies
dietary indiscretion , reports medical compliance.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease status
post CABG in 1994 , coronary artery disease , CHF , cardiomyopathy ,
non-ST-wave MI , status post aortic valve replacement with St.
Jude's valve , hyperlipidemia , diabetes , anxiety.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include aspirin 81 , lisinopril 20 ,
Plavix 75 , verapamil 240 sustained release , gemfibrozil 600
b.i.d. , nystatin 500 b.i.d. , Paxil 20 daily , glipizide 10 daily ,
Coumadin 4 prior to admission to outside hospital , Carvedilol
6.25 daily , heparin drip and spironolactone.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient currently uses tobacco. No alcohol
use. The patient is retired , lives with wife in Lin Con , teaches
graduate courses.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient denies a family history of coronary
artery disease , however , there is hypertension and
cerebrovascular disease in his family.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile ,
heart rate 58 , BP 124/60 , respiratory rate of 20 , saturating 98%
on 2 L. The patient was in no acute distress , lying flat ,
speaking in full sentences. Mucous membranes moist , oropharynx
clear. JVP 12 with bibasilar crackles , left greater than right
and expiratory wheeze with long , pronounced expiratory phase.
Heart , S1 , S2 , prosthetic S2. No murmurs , gallops or rubs
appreciated. Abdomen soft , nontender and nondistended with
positive bowel sounds. Extremities are without edema. DP
intact. Feet are cool but well perfused. Skin warm , dry and
intact , no rashes. The patient is alert and oriented x3.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs notable for creatinine of 1 , hematocrit of
39.5 , platelets of 113 , cholesterol 157 , triglycerides 76 , HDL
32 , LDL 110 , hemoglobin A1c 6.3 , TSH 1.9. EKG , sinus rhythm ,
left bundle branch block with multiple PVCs , a widened QRS of
duration of 190 milliseconds. Chest x-ray , cardiomegaly
consistent with mild interstitial edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 64-year-old male with a
history of coronary artery disease status post CABG and NSTEMI ,
CHF with a known EF of 15% , status post aortic valve replacement ,
presenting through an outside hospital with CHF exacerbation
likely secondary to ischemia.
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: No evidence of ongoing ischemia on admission.
Elevated troponin at outside hospital trended down possibly
secondary to NSTEMI prior to admission versus demand. The
patient was continued on aspirin , Plavix , beta-blocker and ACE
inhibitor , which were titrated to effect. The patient was
started on a statin and continued on Niaspan , left heart cath
revealed occluded graft and 2+ aortic insufficiency with 100% LAD
stenosis , 70% diagonal 1 , 90% circumflex , 45% RCA and 100%
effused LIMA graft to circumflex and a 100% effused SVG graft to
LAD. The patient is now status post stenting the OM V1 and LAD.
The patient has remained asymptomatic and shortness of breath has
improved.
Pump: EF 15% on repeat echo with severe MR. The patient was
continued on spironolactone. The patient continued to be
diuresed initially and is now euvolemic. He will need a repeat
echo in three months to evaluate his ejection fraction and
determine the utility of an AICD placement.
Rhythm: We held verapamil secondary to double AV nodal blockade.
However , with the patient's history of widened QRS and multiple
PVCs and SVT , the patient will follow up with EP to assess the
utility of AICD.
2. Respiratory: The patient has no acute issues. Shortness of
breath has improved. Continues to complain of residual shortness
of breath while lying flat on his left side.
3. Renal: Creatinine has been stable at baseline. We will
closely follow status post chat. The patient was pretreated with
bicarbonate and Mucomyst. Creatinine remained stable.
4. GI: LFTs are mildly increased likely secondary to right
heart failure.
5. Heme: The patient's hematocrit was 39 on admission. It
trended down status post cath likely secondary to blood loss
given the long case and hemodilution; however , hematocrit fell to
38 concerning for retroperitoneal bleed. Despite patient
remaining hemodynamically stable and groin without evidence of
hematoma , the patient underwent a CT scan , which was negative.
His hematocrit was stabilized. He was not transfused , as he was
asymptomatic and recently revascularized. The patient was noted
to be guaiac positive without evidence of gross bleeding , thus
will need outpatient follow-up and colonoscopy. The patient
continues his heparin-bridged Coumadin with a goal of INR 2 to 3.
In addition , the patient suffers from long-term
thrombocytopenia. His platelet count was 113 on admission.
Review of records revealed thrombocytopenia on previous admission
to Norpid Memorial Hospital as well as on presentation to outside hospital prior
to heparinization , thus low suspicion for HIT. The patient's
platelet level remained stable. He should consider outpatient
evaluation by Hematology.
6. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes on oral
hypoglycemics , which were discontinued on admission. The patient
was controlled with regular insulin and placed back on his oral
hypoglycemics prior to discontinuing. A1c was within normal
limits.
7. ID: No acute issues.
8. Psych: History of anxiety , on Paxil and Ativan.
9. FEN: The patient was maintained on a cardiac diet.
10. Prophylaxis: The patient was encouraged to stop smoking.
He was maintained on a nicotine patch during his hospital stay ,
which he tolerated well. He will be discharged with a
prescription for the nicotine patch as well.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is to follow up with PCP and
Cardiology as well as EP. Patient encouraged to check his daily
weights and report a weight increase of more than 2 pounds daily
or 3 pounds a week to his PCP. The patient will also follow up
with INR checks as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE APPOINTMENTS: With his PCP , Dr. Qin , telephone
358-190-7457 , on 10/26/06 at 1:45 , Cardiology with Dr.
Mccoyle at 063-315-1331 on 6/2/06 at 3:15 and with
Electrophysiology , Dr. Kunich on 2/6/06 at 10:20. The patient
should arrange to have his INR drawn on 5/29/06 and follow-up
INRs to be drawn every seven days. INRs will be followed by his
PCP.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 p.o. daily.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Dear Mr. Rumpf , it was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in
the hospital. As you know , you had a heart attack because your
previous stent was occluded. The interventional cardiologist restented
this vessel in the catheterization lab. Please , it is crucial that you
continue taking your medications as instructed , especially ASPIRIN and
PLAVIX. Please take these medications every day until instructed
otherwise by your doctors. Please weigh yourself daily and keep
records of your weight. If you experience worsening shortness of breath
with exertion or at rest , have chest pain , dizziness , fainting , or
swelling , please call your doctor right away or go to the emergency room.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. ) Titrate Coumadin to goal INR 2-3.
2. ) Pt likely needs CPAP machine at home ( failed sleep study )
3. ) Titrate ACEi ( was previously on ARB ) as tolerated , BB ( now on Toprol
XL 200 , instead of atenolol 25 )
4. ) Likely needs re-eval of LV fxn in 6-8 meeks , AICD/PPM , consider
aldosterone antagonist.

Discharge Date: 7/20/2004
ATTENDING: ELVIS CULBERSON M.D.
DATE OF DISCHARGE: To be determined.
SERVICE: Heart Failure.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Referred by primary care physician for
increased dyspnea on exertion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 63-year-old male with COPD , CABG ,
ischemic cardiomyopathy , hypertension , CRI , CAD , atrial
fibrillation , distant history of DVT , morbid obesity , presents
with three weeks of increased dyspnea on exertion despite an
increase in his Lasix dose from 80 mg b.i.d. to 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d. He has also had progressive fatigue and somnolence. He
denies PND , orthopnea , chest pain , recently ( one week ago ). He
had productive cough and was started on amoxicillin with some
initial improvement in his energy , but has had a continuous
decline since then. He can do his activities of daily living ,
but he gets shortness of breath when he is wheeling around in his
wheelchair. He went to his primary care physician , Dr. Emil Hattaway who felt that he was volume overloaded and noticed a
desaturation to 81% on room air and admitted him to the Heart
Failure Service for diuresis and optimization.

1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. Morbid obesity.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline 1.6 to 1.9 ).
4. Gynecomastia.

6. Coronary artery disease.
7. Diabetes 2.
8. Venous stasis ulcer.
9. COPD.
10. Two-vessel CABG in 1995.
11. Echo in 2003 showing EF of 25% to 30%.

19. Echocardiogram 4/23/04 showed EF 25% to 30% , akinesis of
the inferior wall , right ventricular function was moderately
reduced , trace aortic insufficiency , mild mitral regurgitation ,
mild tricuspid regurgitation , PASP of 36 plus right atrial
pressure.
20. Hemoglobin A1c on 11/29/04 was 5.6.
ALLERGIES: Linezolid.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lasix 180 mg p.o. b.i.d. ( increased from 120 mg b.i.d. on
4/13/04 ).
2. Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. started on 11/9/04.

7. Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q. day.
The following medications have been stopped recently:
1. ACE inhibitor ( for hyperkalemia ).
2. Zocor.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 96.7 , pulse 95 , blood pressure
140/66 , respirations 20 , saturation 83% on room air up to 90% on
2 liters. The patient was in no apparent distress at rest , but
had mild shortness of breath with repositioning. His JVP was 13
to 14 cm. He had crackles bilaterally , one-third of the way up
his lungs. Heart was regular rate and rhythm , 2/7 left upper
sternal border murmur. Abdomen: Obese , nontender , nondistended ,
normoactive bowel sounds. He had a left below the knee
amputation , which was warm and clean. Right leg was fully
intact , but there is severe crusting of the skin of the leg from
the knee down , very swollen right foot with skin intact and no
palpable pulses.
LABORATORIES: Sodium 139 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 101 ,
bicarbonate 30 , BUN 71 , creatinine 1.7 , glucose 125. BNP was
473 , digoxin 0.8 , albumin 3.7. White blood cell count 6.2 ,
hematocrit 39.8 , platelets 122 , 000 , INR 3.0 , PTT 68.9. Chest
x-ray showed small bilateral effusions and enlarged cardiac
silhouette. EKG left bundle-branch block with no peaked T waves ,
normal sinus rhythm , T-wave inversion in I , L , V5 , V6 ( which
represent repolarization abnormality because they are asymmetric ,
consistent with LVH although it does not meet formal LVH
criteria ).
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: The patient had no clear evidence of ischemia , but
given his symptoms , the troponin was checked and that was
negative.
b. Pump: The patient was felt to be volume overloaded. His
admission weight was 130 kg. He was started on IV Lasix for
diuresis and began to diurese well putting out approximately 2 to
3 liters negative per day. He had a right heart catheterization
which showed right atrial pressure 16 , pulmonary artery pressure
of 66/26 with a mean of 42 , mean wedge pressure of 25 suggesting
high left-sided and right-sided filling pressures. Cardiac
output was 7.83 , cardiac index was 3.09 , SVR was 695 , PVR was
174. Therefore , the patient was felt to still be volume
overloaded and was diuresed further. At the time of this
dictation , his weight has dropped to 118 kg from 130 on
admission.
From the perspective of blood pressure , he was started on
hydralazine and Isordil to reduce his afterload and these were
titrated up with the goal systolic blood pressure of less than
120.
c. Rhythm: The patient had atrial fibrillation and he was kept
on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 to 3 except when he was being
prepped for his right heart cath. He is now being restarted on
Coumadin following the cath with the goal INR of 2 to 3.
2. Pulmonary: The patient seemed to have several possible
causes for his shortness of breath including volume overload and
his underlying COPD and body habitus. An arterial blood gas was
done with 2 liters nasal cannula on 10/11/04 and this showed pH
of 7.28 , CO2 of 76 , oxygen of 67 , and bicarbonate of 37. This is
on 2 liters nasal cannula giving an A-a gradient of 16. Compared
to his prior ABG in January 2003 , which showed pH 7.43 , carbon
dioxide of 52 , and oxygen of 60 with a bicarbonate of 37. This
suggested that the patient was hypoventilating. Therefore , he
was started on BiPAP overnight and he said that his sense of
comfort of breathing improved following BiPAP. At this point , he
will be sent home on home BiPAP.
3. Chest x-ray showed small- to moderate-sized bilateral
effusions , which were confirmed on a chest CT. However , because
the patient was still volume overloaded and seemed to be
improving with diuresis , a pleural tap was not attempted.
4. Dermatological: The patient had severe skin thickening from
his lymphedema. Dermatology was consulted for proper care of his
legs. They were initially concerned that there could have been a
superimposed cellulitis and the patient was initially started on
levofloxacin; however , there do not appear to be significant
clinical evidence of cellulitis and therefore , the levofloxacin
was discontinued after two days. Dermatology made specific
recommendations for care specifically , one-quarter strength
Dakin's soaks b.i.d. moist-to-dry on the legs followed by
betamethasone cream and Lac-Hydrin cream mixture twice a day.
There is also an indurated plaque on the right bridge of the
patient's nose for which Dermatology performed a shave biopsy for
concern of a basal cell carcinoma versus a squamous cell
carcinoma. This showed endophytic squamous proliferation with
atypia although the basal layer was not fully represented. This
was potentially the most superficially portion of a squamous cell
carcinoma and deeper sampling was required for more definitive
diagnosis. Deeper sampling has not yet occurred at this point.
5. Urology: The patient was noted to have a blood-tinged urine
output into his Foley. Initially , this was dark red; however ,
this lightened significantly. There are also some clots evident.
The Foley was removed and the patient was able to urinate on his
own; however , his urine is still tinged with blood although it
appears to have lightened up. Further followup will be required
likely with Urology as an outpatient.
6. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus , type 2 , which
is well controlled after his recent weight loss. He was
maintained on glipizide and lispro sliding scale.
7. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency secondary
to his diabetes mellitus. We avoided contrast dye. The
patient's creatinine has not increased during the diuresis
process going from 1.7 on admission to 1.7 on 1/23/04.
The discharge medications and instructions will be dictated as an
addendum at the time of discharge.

Discharge Date: 6/9/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year old male with
mitral regurgitation and a history of
congestive heart failure , who presents for cardiac catheterization
and a coronary artery bypass graft. He has a history of severe
coronary artery disease and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
He is status post multiple previous myocardial infarctions and
presents with dyspnea on exertion over the last several months.
However , he denies any frank chest pain. The patient's cardiac
workup revealed four vessel coronary artery disease and severe
mitral regurgitation. He is preoperatively admitted to the
cardiology service for surgical planning for coronary artery bypass
grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus;
osteomyelitis; anemia; right 5th and left
third toe amputation; peripheral vascular disease; anemia; chronic
renal insufficiency; status post laminectomy; tobacco and alcohol
use.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin , Lasix , Accupril , Digoxin , Isordil , and
aspirin.
ALLERGIES: To fish , which causes swelling.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Spanish-speaking male in no acute
distress. NECK: No carotid bruits. LUNGS:
Crackles at the bases bilaterally. HEART: II/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the axilla , with a displaced of PMI. ABDOMEN: Soft ,
non-tender. EXTREMITIES: The femoral pulses are palpable
bilaterally , however , there were no palpable distal pulses. There
was no evidence of any significant varicosities. The left shin is
significant for two small eschars with a minimal rim of erythema.
His lower extremity is consistent with chronic vascular disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for surgical planning.
Previous echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of 25-30% , a dilated left atrial size , 4+ MR , and moderate
TR. There was also severe hypokinesis of the inferior posterior
wall of left ventricle. Cardiac catheterization performed on
2/8 showed four vessel disease. Follow-up ABI studies were
stable with the right at 0.68 and the left at 1.61. Carotid
noninvasive studies showed no significant carotid disease to
warrant surgical evaluation.
On 7/23 , the patient was taken to the operating room , where
quadruple coronary artery bypass graft was performed , as well as a
mitral valve repair with a #26 posterior Cosgrove annuloplasty
band. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported
to the cardiac surgery ICU.
Postoperatively , the patient's course was significant for acute and
chronic renal insufficiency in the setting of a low ejection
fraction , congestive heart failure , and volume overload. The
patient was weaned off of epinephrine and diuresed accordingly. He
was subsequently transferred to the stepdown unit after several
days in the ICU. He continued to progress well with the additional
diuresis. His chest tubes and wires were removed without
difficulty. Radiographs showed improvement in bilateral pulmonary
edema.
On the day of discharge , the patient was stable with stable vital
signs. He was afebrile , with no significant leukocytosis. His
renal function had returned to his baseline of around 2.0.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 2 ) captopril

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. HYPERTENSION.
2. LEFT FRONTAL LOBE MENINGIOMA.
3. DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Testani is a 90+ year-old woman with
a history of hypertension , prior
atrial fibrillation , who presented to the Ie Health on
2/14/01 with shortness of breath and some chest pain lasting
several hours at home. She was brought in by her great
granddaughter and found to have ST segment elevations inferiorly on
an electrocardiogram concerning for inferior myocardial infarction.
At that point she was transferred to Hobert Center
for emergent catheterization. In the emergency room she was
treated with Lasix , Lopressor , morphine , nitropaste , aspirin and
heparin and then sent for cardiac catheterization. Cardiac
catheterization showed a right dominant system with no left main
disease , mid left anterior descending coronary artery 80 percent
lesion , a proximal left circumflex left anterior descending
coronary artery lesion and a proximal 100 percent posterior
descending coronary artery stenosis. The posterior descending
coronary artery was intervened upon and stented to a residual
stenosis of 0 percent. The patient tolerated the procedure well
without any complications and was then transferred to the intensive
care unit for further monitoring. On admission to the coronary
care unit the patient had no complaints , including no shortness of
breath , and no chest pain. She was noted to have a right groin
hematoma for which pressure was held.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , atrial fibrillation , history
of pulmonary edema , left frontal lobe
meningioma as documented by MRI of the brain in February of 2000.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix dose unknown , atenolol 50 mg p.o.
q day , Zestril 10 mg per day , Isordil 10
mg t.i.d. and meclizine p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98 , heart rate 75 , blood pressure
140/70 , respiratory rate 16 , 94 percent on 2 liters
of oxygen. GENERAL: Awake , alert and oriented in no acute
distress. Oropharynx is clear. Crackles present bilaterally
throughout both lung fields. CARDIAC: Regular , rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2. II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border. No radiation to the neck. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender and
nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No edema. 2
plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Neurologic
status intact. Nonfocal exam.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: White blood cell count 13.6 ,
hematocrit 39 , platelets 222 , 000.
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 100 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 37 ,
creatinine 2.0 , glucose 192. PT was 11 , PTT 23 , INR 0.88. CK
number one is 216 with no MB fraction done prior to transfer. CK
number two post cardiac catheterization 2577 , MB 310 , troponin
3.49.
Electrocardiogram prior to transfer showed normal sinus rhythm at
the time pre-catheterization. Rate of 75. Two millimeter ST
segment elevation in leads II , III and F.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: The patient was transferred
to the coronary care unit after cardiac
catheterization and right coronary artery stent for further
management. She ruled in for a myocardial infarction. Her peak CK
was 2577 with a MB fraction of 310. Troponin on admission was
3.49. She was placed on aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , Zestril and
simvastatin. Two days after this initial catheterization on
10/10/01 , the patient was transferred to the floor and subsequently
had an episode of flash pulmonary edema and was thought to be to
diastolic dysfunction. This occurred in the context of her having
a systolic blood pressure of 200. She was then transferred back to
the coronary care unit where she had intermittent complaints of
chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed pseudo normalization of the T
waves laterally. Her CKs continued to trend down however due to
the concern of further ischemia she was placed on heparin and
brought back to the catheterization laboratory on 6/27/01 for
stenting of the left circumflex lesion. Since the second stent she
continued to do well from a cardiovascular standpoint. Her CKs
continued to trend down. An echocardiogram was done which showed
an ejection fraction of 45 percent , inferior posterior akinesis ,
moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
She was managed with aspirin , Plavix with plans to keep her on this
for one month , Zocor and Lopressor. Due to a rising creatinine
after the second catheterization her Zestril has been stopped and
she has been started on hydralazine until her creatinine
normalizes.
2. Renal: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.6 which
increased to 4.0 after her second catheterization. The etiology is
deemed to be contrast induced nephropathy. Her creatinine is now
improving down to 3.2 at the time of discharge. This should be
followed and her Zestril restarted at 10 mg per day and the
hydralazine stopped when the creatinine normalizes to below 2.0.
Electrolytes were stable throughout the admission.
3. Pulmonary: No active issues currently. She did have an
episode of flash pulmonary edema in the setting of high blood
pressure found to be due to diastolic dysfunction. The goal is to
control the patient's blood pressure to avoid these episodes.
There is no need for diuresis.
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with a hematocrit
of 39 but did drop to 27 slowly during the course of the admission.
She did have guaiac positive stools while on heparin. She was
transfused a total of two units to keep her hematocrit above 30 and
for the five days prior to discharge , her hematocrit was stable at
34. The patient consumes a low fat low cholesterol diet and is on
Prilosec 20 mg q day.
5. Psychiatry/neurologic: The patient was noted to sun down at
night with episodes of confusion and agitation. A psychiatry
consult was obtained and felt that the patient's behavior was
consistent with dementia and recommended starting Zyprexa. The
patient was placed on standing Zyprexa 5 mg at night and continued
to improve on this medication. She had no episodes of agitation
after being transferred to the floor. In addition she has a
history of left frontal lobe mass which is consistent with a
meningioma. This has been noted on CT and MRI scans done in February
of 2000. Neurosurgery consult was obtained and felt that surgery
would not be a good option for this patient , in addition they did
not feel that the mass was responsible for any mental status
changes.
6. Infectious disease: The patient has a history of a positive
RPR which has not been treated previously. She is now being
treated for syphilis with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units
times three injections. She has one injection pending which is due
on 3/5/01. In addition she has had a negative lumbar puncture
for neurologic syphilis.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is to be discharged to the
Chora Medical Center with
eventual plans to return to home.
She will also follow up with a new primary care provider , Dr. Ernesto Fouch at the Crestsant Health on 2/2/01.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: The patient was brought to the ESIH ED by her daughter with the chief
complaint of left leg pain. They were concerned about the healing of her
left fibula/tibia fracture.
---
HPI: The patient is a 72-year-old woman with CAD s/p CABG , chronic kidney
disease ( declined HD ) , congestive heart failure ( EF 30% ) , HTN , and
hypocalcemia. She has also been hospitalized numerous times in the past
two years for CHF exacerbations in the setting of NSTEMI. She has
preferred not to take any of her prescribed medications despite repeated
discussions about benefits of decreased mortality , prevention of
re-hospitalization , and symptom management. In April 2006 she sustained a
displaced LLE tib/fib fx after banging her leg into her bed while driving
her motorized scooter in her apartment. She has been treated by Dr.
Russel Frausto at PCHCOC . She initally refused surgical repair and was
casted , but subsequent films have shown valgus angulation and poor
healing. She declined surgery ( and was a high-risk surgical candidate
given her multiple comorbidities. On 11/27/06 the cast was removed by
Dr. Malhotra and has been in a walking boot since then. She states that
she has pain of the left midleg that she has treated with Tylenol and
that has limited her ability to try and bear weight.
Her daughter brings her in today because of concern for her mother's left
leg. The air cast was taken off yesterday and since then , she has had
worsening pain of the leg. She has been unable to move it or bear any
wait. There is a valgus deformity. They are requesting orthopedic
evaluation. She denies new numbness/tingling or weakness in the
extremities. She also notes multiple chronic problems including
decreased appetite with 40lb weight loss over the past 4-6 months ,
lethargy , apathy. ""I just want to be able to walk again and do the
things I used to like doing."" ( Going to the horse track , walking
outside. ) She states that she is NOT depressed but sleeps most of the
day.
The family has discussed these symptoms with her PCP. In the past ,
symptoms have been attributed to her worsening renal failure , cardiac
status in this patient who refuses to take any medications. She has
wanted to remain home yet has had documented discussions with PCP about
the benefits of placement to a nursing home for longterm care. Family is
currently looking into assisted living facilities. She also has
requested DNR/DNI status in the past.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease: s/p IMI and 2-V-CABG , July of 2001
( LIMA>LAD , SVG>PDA. ) Her anginal equivalents are N/V but not CP. She is
followed by a cardiologist , Dr. Trent Cannizzo at CICGH . She is uninterested
in pursuing any additional cardiac evaluation.
2. CHF with EF 26% ( 5/25 ). Mod-Severe MR. Several exacerbations over
past yr. in setting of NSTEMI ( 3/22 )
3. Hypertension.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2 , non-insulin requiring. Her most recent
hemoglobin A1c was less than 6% without medications. Her diabetic
complications include peripheral neuropathy and chronic kidney disease.
5. Chronic kidney disease 2/2 DM with a baseline creatinine of 3.5 to 4.
She has no interest in hemodialysis.
6. Hypocalcemia secondary to chronic kidney disease and profound vitamin
D deficiency with an associated myopathy and bone pain. She also has
severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
7. History of colon cancer status post a partial colectomy. The patient
has requested no follow-up for this problem.
8. Osteoarthritis status post a left total hip replacement for aseptic
necrosis. Since that time she has a leg length discrepancy and uses
crutches to ambulate until a recent tib/fib fx which has left her
WC-dependent.
9. Chronic anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease. She does have a
history of prior upper GI bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease.
ROS: No recent fevers/chills or night sweats. No shortness of breath ,
cough or chest pain. No abdominal pain. No constipation/diarrhea. No

IMPRESSION:
72F with multiple chronic medical problems s/p recent tib/fib fx
( non-surg mgmt ) admitted for evaluation of her fracture. She was admitted
to medicine for ""longterm placement."" Yet upon interview of the family
they intend for Ms. Pall to go home after this hospital stay. From
there , she will transition to assisted living. Over the last few months ,
she has declined to take any medications or treatment for her chronic
kidney disease or cardiac disease. This has led to progressive renal
disease , electrolyte abnormalities and myopathy. The family brings her
in with concerns regarding her left leg. While they do want to
transition to assisted living , they do not intend to place her directly
from DUOMC to RH or Rehab. They hope she will go home after this hospital
stay and continue with VNA/services.
ORTHO: Tib/fib fracture. Non-surgically managed. Followed by Dr.
Alirez Seen by Orthopedic service who discussed the 2 options:
casting with patellar tendon bearing cast or surgery. As before ,
patient declined surgery ( this decision has been supported by her PCP and
cardiologist as she is a high risk surgical candidate. ) There were no
casting technicians in-house this weekend. Therefore she will followup in
the Orthopedics clinic on Wednesday , as instructed by the ortho resident
on call.
.
CKD. Monitor renal function and lytes. Patient agreed to take vitamin
supplements such as nephrocaps. Phosphate was wnl despite not taking
phoslo at home.
.
CHRONIC HYPOCALCEMIA: Elevated PTH. Patient agreed to take calcitriol
.
ENDOCRINE: recent elevated TSH. T3/T4 pending at discharge.
-H/o Diabetes yet with progressive renal failure , does not require
insulin and with nl A1C
.
CV: EF 30% , multiple prior admits for CHF. Was in NOT in CHF on admission
and had stable O2 saturation at 98-100% on RA with no recent increase in
DOE.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
50 y.o. female with multiple medical problems
including obesity , IDDM , hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , sleep
apnea presents with worsening SOB x 1 month. She reports that
following a pneumonia about 1 year ago , she has
felt progressively short of breath. Over the
past month , her symptoms have become
incerasingly bothersome , interfering with her ability to
talk , walk , and exert herself. She denies
fever/chills/ chest pain/palpitations/PND , but does report
4 pillow orthopnea ( increased from 2 ) , nocturia
( at baseline ). She presented to her pulmonologist
5/6 who felt that her lung disease was
most consistent with restrictive lung disease due
to her obesity. She presented to her allergist
3 days PTA , who felt that she had a CXR
consistent with CHF and increased her lasix to 100 qdx 3 days
with some effect. She presented to her PCP on the
day of admission and was noted to have a decreased
O2 sat; she was sent to TSGH for further evaluation.
Of note , she has many allergies , including latex , was a 1.5 ppd smoker
x 30 years , quit one and a half years ago , and has recently started a
weight loss program , losing 22 pounds in 3
months. In the ED , she was given aspirin ,
solumedrol , nebs , and ativan with some relief. Pertinent exam
findings: markedly obese , labored breathing at times , but speaking
in full sentences. No JVD. Lungs: rare wheezes , few crackles at
bases , no signs of consolidation. CV: distant , RRR , S1 S2
Abd: soft , obese Ext: trace edema , WWP , no calf tenderness. A/P: Pulm:
Likely restrictive component due to obesity as well as deconditioning ,
likely anxiety component as well as possible pulmonary hypertension due
to sleep apnea , smoking hx. Subjectively , acute exacerbation of sx may
also be related to heat/humidity. Nebs for comfort , but primary goal
is for increased cardiopulmonary fitness , weight loss. CPAP for sleep
apnea as well. Outpatient pulmonary rehab. O2 sat 97% on RA with
ambulation prior to d/c. Symptoms improved. CV: continue cardiac
meds , lipid lowering agents. ID: no infectious etiology/sx Endo: Type 2
DM- continue current regimen. Sent HgbA1C.
Pt was discharged home in stable condition she will follow up with her
primary care doctor.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you have chest pain , increasing shortness of breath , headache ,
fever , or other worrisome symptoms , please call your doctor or return
to the hospital.

fibrillation , which has since resolved and C. diff colitis at
rehab. She was discharged from the Wooda Community Hospital to rehabilitation
facility on 10/4/06 where she developed C. diff colitis and
diarrhea. She was started on p.o. Flagyl , which she continued
until the first week of August . Prior to that , she had been
treated with Cipro for UTI while at the Luke's Ca Health . She was
improving clinically until about three days prior to admission
when she noted persistent diarrhea. She began to feel lethargic
with subjective fevers and chills. She also noticed chest pain
that was substernal and intermittent with left arm pain. Pain
was described as diffuse , constant and 3/10 in intensity. Pain
was nonexertional. She also noted persistently loose stools
without blood. On arrival to the emergency room , she had a fever
to 102 Fahrenheit. No tenderness in her chest to suggest
mediastinitis. She was seen by Thoracic Surgery in the emergency
room and cleared.
ED COURSE: Echo was obtained. Chest x-ray , chest CT and blood
and urine cultures were obtained. She was given vancomycin 1 gm
plus Flagyl 500 x1 , given IV fluids 500 mL normal saline and
potassium.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital Signs: Temperature
101 , heart rate in the 110s , O2 saturation 96% on 2 L ,
respiratory rate is 15. General: She is alert and oriented x3
and sleepy , using accessory muscles of respiration. Neck: JVP
is flat , no neck lymphadenopathy. HEENT: Mucous membranes dry.
CV: Irregular. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
abdomen: Mild epigastric tenderness , nontender , nondistended.
Neuro: Grossly nonfocal. Extremities: Warm with pulse. No
clubbing , cyanosis or edema.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 137 , potassium 3.4 , CO2 26 ,

enlargement , left ventricular hypertrophy by aVL criteria , normal
axis , no ST-T changes.
ASSESSMENT: This is a 71-year-old woman with a history of
hypertension , CHF , status post a mitral valve/tricuspid valve
repair in mid September , complicated by postoperative C. diff
colitis and UTI who presented with persistent diarrhea and three
days of fever , chills and chest pain. The patient's fatigue was
most likely related to dehydration secondary to persistent C.
diff related diarrhea. Over the course of her hospitalization ,
it became clear that she experienced chest pain during her
intermittent episodes of ventricular ectopy. Now that her NSVT
is under better control , she is chest pain-free.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient was continued on aspirin , beta-blocker ,
statin and gemfibrozil. She had negative cardiac enzymes x3 and
ruled out by biomarkers.
Pump: The patient was initially dry on exam. She was rehydrated
with normal saline. The patient developed shortness of breath on
hospital day #4 , most likely secondary to overhydration. She was
gently diuresed with IV Lasix. Electrolytes were repleted twice
daily. She was then transitioned to 40 of Lasix p.o. daily and
finally per cardiology recommendation 20. She will be discharged
to home on 20 b.i.d. p.o.
Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. On
hospital day #2 , she developed atrial fibrillation with
hypotension most likely secondary to Diltiazem , which was
subsequently held. The patient's blood pressure improved
dramatically with gentle IV hydration on hospital day #2. Her
Diltiazem will be discontinued. The patient is on Coumadin now
with therapeutic INR on discharge at 2.6. Per cardiology , her
beta-blocker was increased to 75 q.i.d. and then she was
transitioned to Toprol 300 daily; however , she had persistent
nocturnal NSVT , which caused her some chest pain and was quite
frightening to her. Per cardiology , she was loaded on amiodarone
400 t.i.d. , which will be continued for 5 days post-discharge and
then the patient will be transitioned to 400 amiodarone daily.
At the same time , her Toprol will be decreased to 100 mg daily ,
her discharge dose. Echocardiogram was ordered on the day of
discharge per cardiology. See LMR for formal report.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient with recent UTI and C. diff
colitis in the setting of recent hospitalization antibiotic use
presented with diarrhea and elevated white count and fever.
Continued on Flagyl p.o. and vancomycin p.o. for Flagyl failure.
She had one C. diff positive stool. Stool became C. diff
negative as of 9/2/06. Her diarrhea rapidly slowed on dual
therapy. She will be discharged with seven more days of
antibiotics to complete.
3. Endocrine: The patient on home dose Synthroid. TSH
initially low , however , rechecked and found to be within normal
limits. Continue home dose of Synthroid.
4. Heme: The patient's hematocrit was stable throughout her
hospitalization. Continue Niferex at home dose , continue
Coumadin at 2.5 mg nightly.
5. Pulmonary: The patient had a low pretest probability for PE.
Given her allergy to IV contrast , she was not a candidate for
PECT; however , a V/Q scan was obtained on 1/19/06. The result
was low probability for pulmonary embolism. Her respiratory exam
improved greatly on b.i.d. Lasix.
6. Renal. The patient's creatinine was stable throughout her
hospitalization.
7. Prophylaxis: Coumadin with therapeutic INR plus proton pump
inhibitor.
8. FEN: The patient was initially started on a clear liquid
diet. On hospital day #3 , she began to eat solid foods and
tolerated well.
9. Code status: The patient was a full code throughout her
hospitalization.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Continue home medications as indicated.
2. Continue vancomycin and Flagyl for 7 more days.
3. VNA instructed to draw INR on Thursday , 2 days post-discharge
and follow up with Raycennant Dehey Community Hospital Coumadin Clinic.
4. Stop Diltiazem and metoprolol.
5. Start Toprol-XL 100 mg daily.
6. Continue amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. until Sunday , 5/29/06 and
then switch to 400 mg daily.
7. Check LFTs and TSH on Friday and weekly thereafter.
8. Check electrolytes on Friday and twice weekly thereafter.
CONTINUING CARE PLANS FOR MD:
1. Continue vancomycin and Flagyl p.o. until 12/10/06 , stop on
8/11/06.
2. Continue home medications as indicated.
3. Check electrolytes on Friday. Consider adding p.o. magnesium
and potassium repletion after diarrhea resolves.

FAMILY HISTORY:
The patient has a positive family history of coronary disease ,
hypertension and diabetes.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM/ PROBLEM:
Persistent pulmonary
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure. On 1/7/06 , shortly after
her admission to the medical floor , the patient was noted to be
in respiratory distress with tachypnea , accessory muscle use and
oxygen saturation of 68% on 6 liters nasal cannula. She was
placed on a nonrebreather. Her oxygen saturation increased to
93%; however , she continued to be in respiratory distress with
tachypnea and accessory muscle use. She was intubated and
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
evaluation and management. Her respiratory failure was thought
to be secondary to pneumonia with a component of superimposed
volume overload. She was treated with a 10-day course of
vancomycin , levofloxacin and ceftazidime as well as with IV
Lasix. She underwent a code green on 7/30/06 during an ETT tube
change , wherein a patent airway was transiently loss. The
patient was slow to wean from the ventilator. Her chest imaging
revealed persistent bilateral opacifications. It was thought
that after an initial infectious insult , the patient developed
ARDS. On 9/14/06 , the patient underwent bronchoscopy and BAL
revealing MRSA and HSV. The patient was treated with a 10-day
course of acyclovir for presumed HSV tracheobronchitis. Given
her inability to be weaned from the vent , the patient underwent a
tracheostomy on 4/17/06 .  Post-tracheostomy , the patient
alternated between pressure support ventilation with low driving
pressure and PEEP with a trach collar..
Infectious disease:
1. Fevers. From 1/7/06 to 7/28/06 , the patient was treated
with vancomycin , levofloxacin and ceftazidime for hospital
acquired pneumonia. After discontinuation of her antibiotics ,
the patient continued to spike fevers and evidence of
leukocytosis. In verification into source of her fevers included
serial blood cultures , urine cultures and C-dif. Positive data
included: 7/28/06 , urine culture with yeast , 7/28/06 , blood
culture with coag-negative staph , 9/14/06 BAL washings with HSV ,
9/14/06 , blood culture with coag-negative staph , 7/11/06 , blood
culture with coag-negative staph , 2/29/06 , urine culture with
yeast , 2/29/06 BAL washings with MRSA , 10/28/06 urine with yeast
urine with yeast , 10/28/06 , 6/23/06 , 4/17/06 , and 10/11/06
sputum with MRSA. 7/28/06 , chest CT with bilateral
opacification in the lung parenchyma. 2/29/06 facial CT with
left sphenoid maxillary thickening. 2/29/06 chest CT with
bilateral opacification in the lung parenchyma. Of note , a
2/29/06 abdominal CT showed no evidence of abdominal infection ,
2/29/06 TTE showed no obvious vegetations , and 10/11/06 tap of
the right knee grew no organisms. In light of the data above ,
the patient's indwelling catheters were changed. She underwent
treatment with linezolid x7 days for MRSA line infection. She
also underwent treatment with acyclovir x10 days for HSV
tracheobronchitis. The aforementioned antibiosis was mostly
prophylactic. It was thought that the patient's intermittent
fevers were not infectious , but rather reflected a drug allergy ,
most likely to vancomycin. This hypothesis was supported by a
robust eosinophilia coinciding with vancomycin administration.
Shortly after vancomycin discontinuation , the patient's fevers
resolved. The patient was afebrile for greater than 48 hours off
all antibiotics prior to transfer to rehabilitation.
Cardiovascular:
1. Volume status. The patient's admission weight was 106.2 kg.
It is unclear what her dry weight was. Given that pulmonary
edema was thought to be contributing to the patient's slow
ventilator wean , she was diuresed with a combination of Lasix and
Diuril followed by combinations of torsemide and Diuril. Her
discharge weight was 100.7 kilograms. Her diuretic regimen on
discharge with torsemide 100 mg IV t.i.d. and Diuril 500 mg IV
t.i.d. The patient's diuretic regimen will need be adjusted as
her intake is adjusted. Her creatinine will need to be monitored
very closely. Her weight will need to be checked daily.
2. Pump: The patient underwent echocardiogram on 11/19/06 ,
7/17/06 , and 2/29/06 .  On the whole , these studies revealed an
ejection fraction of 45-50% , concentric LVH , global hypokinesis
with regional variation , mild left atrial enlargement , mild
tricuspid regurgitation , a question of mild atrial stenosis , and
pulmonary artery pressures in the 40s. For her heart failure ,
the patient was treated with Lopressor and diuretics as above.
She was not started on an ACE inhibitor given her allergy
( cough ). She was started on low-dose ARB.
3. Ischemia: The patient has a history of coronary artery
disease status post three-vessel CABG and subsequent
single-vessel PPI. She has an RCA stenosis , 70-80% that has not
intervened upon. On admission , in the setting of respiratory
distress , the patient was in sinus tachycardia with rate related
to lateral ST depressions. Her cardiac biomarkers were positive
consistent with NSTEMI. It was thought that the patient
experienced demand ischemia rather than an acute plaque rupture.
On 10/8/06 , her troponin peaked at 8.53 , her CK at 275 , and her
MB of 16.3. The patient was treated with aspirin , Lopressor , and
Zocor. She was not started on an ACE inhibitor as detailed
above. She will likely warrant Cardiology followup with possible
RCA revascularization.
Neuro:
1. Sedation: While intubated , the patient was treated with IV
Versed and fentanyl titrated to light sedation. After her
tracheostomy , the patient's Versed and fentanyl drips were
discontinued. She was treated with Seroquel at bedtime to
preclude nighttime agitation. Her QTC should be monitored while
on Seroquel.
GI:
1. FEN: The patient initially received tube feeds via feeding
tube. She underwent a PEG placement on 4/17/06 .  She continued
on tube feeds. She also passed speech and Swallow and was thus
started on p.o. feeds with aspiration precautions. She also
received supplemental multivitamins , calcium carbonate , and
cholecalciferol. The patient will require speech and swallow
evaluation at rehabilitation. Now that she is awake , she may be
able to tolerate oral feeds with aspiration precautions.
2. Bowel regimen. The patient was treated with Colace , senna ,
and Dulcolax.
Heme:
1. Anemia: The patient has known iron deficiency anemia. She
was continued on iron and folate. She may benefit from an
outpatient colonoscopy if she has not had one recently.
2. Bleeding from tracheostomy site: On 4/24/06 , the patient
was noted to have bleeding from her tracheostomy site. She had
no hematocrit drop. She remained hemodynamically stable. She
underwent a bronchoscopy , which showed no active bleeding. Her
mild bleeding was thought to relate to suction trauma. Her
prophylactic heparin was held x1 day. It was thought that the
patient should be discharged on prophylactic heparin because her
DVT risk is so high. Should the patient have intense bleeding
from the tracheostomy site , a hematocrit drop or hemodynamic
changes. Her heparin subcu should be discontinued , her
hematocrit should be monitored closely , and she should be
transfused as needed. She should also at that point probably
undergo reevaluation by Pulmonary or Thoracics.
Endocrine:
1. Diabetes: The patient was treated with Lantus plus regular
insulin q. 6h. plus sliding scale insulin while she was on tube
feeds. Her insulin was changed on the night prior to discharge.
She was started on Lantus 100 subq b.i.d. She got her first dose
of 100 units subq on the evening prior to discharge , her morning
sugars were in the mid 100s. Her blood sugars should be followed
closely on the first one or two days at rehab. The blood sugars
should be monitored every 2-3 hours and her insulin should be
adjusted accordingly. Her insulin dose should be adjusted if her
tube feeds are cycled rather than given continuously or if she is
NPO.
Ortho:
1. Total knee replacement: The patient is status post right
total knee replacement on 8/19/06 .  Her right knee has a
well-healed incision and is not erythematous or tender. The
patient was initially on low-dose anticoagulation with Coumadin.
Her Coumadin was discontinued given her acute illness and her
need for procedures. She was treated with heparin subq
prophylactic doses 5000 units t.i.d. as described above. She
will need rehabilitation for her knee.
2. Prophylaxis: The patient was treated with subcutaneous
heparin and Nexium.
3. Access: The patient has peripheral IVs.
DISCHARGE STATUS:
On the day of discharge 3/8/06 , the patient was afebrile.
Heart rate was in the 80s , blood pressure was in the
100s-130s/60s-80s. Discharge weight was 100.7 kilograms. The
patient was drowsy , but arouseable. She was breathing on a trach
collar. She had decreased breath sounds at the bases. She had
an S1 and S2 with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the lower sternal
border. Her abdomen was soft and nontender with positive bowel
sounds. Her trach and PEG site were intact without any
surrounding erythema. Her extremities were warm without edema.
She was on trach collar with 50% FiO2 and oxygen saturation of
97%. Her discharge labs included a white blood cell count of 21 ,
stable , hematocrit of 28 , and platelets 436 , 000. Her chem-7
included a sodium of 131 , potassium 3 , chloride 87 , CO2 32 , BUN
67 , creatinine 0.8 , and glucose 154. Her LFTs were normal. Her
INR was 1.1. Her most recent microdata showed sputum with few
polys and a few gram-positive cocci in clusters. Her chest x-ray
showed a trach in place and bilateral hazy infiltrate consistent
with resolving ARDS.
An addendum will be given with discharge medications and doses.
At rehab , the patient's weight should be monitored daily. Her
blood sugars initially be monitored every 2-3 hours. After that ,
her blood sugar monitoring can be spaced out to t.i.d. or
whenever deemed appropriate by the physician at the
rehabilitation facility. Her hematocrit should be checked
particularly if she has any bleeding from her tracheostomy site;
otherwise , the hematocrit can be checked every day. The white
blood cell count should be monitored if the patient has any
fever. The creatinine should be monitored daily in light of the
patient's changing diuretic regimen. The patient in's and out's
should be monitored closely.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Borge is a 64-year-old gentleman with a previous history of
myocardial infarction x4 who presented to the Emergency
Department on 3/10/06 with shortness of breath and dyspnea on
exertion over the previous two months. The patient has known
coronary artery disease and has undergone multiple PTCAs and
balloon angioplasties in the past of his posterior descending branch
of his right coronary artery in 1996 , and stenting of his
posterior descending coronary artery in 2004 , also stenting of
his distal right coronary artery in 2005. While in the emergency
department , the patient had an episode of substernal chest
pressure radiating to his left jaw and left upper extremity. He
received sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine with relief. EKG
at that time revealed a right bundle-branch block with T-wave
inversions in the leads V2 , V3 , and slightly T-wave elevation in
leads II , III and aVF. On 1/5/06 , he underwent cardiac
catheterization , which revealed the following , posterior
descending coronary artery with an ostial 80% stenosis , right
coronary artery with a distal 60% stenosis , left circumflex
coronary artery with the proximal 60% stenosis , left anterior
descending coronary artery with an ostial 50% stenosis. Right
dominant circulation and right coronary artery had extensive
stenting with 50-60% focal areas of restenosis. Distal right
coronary artery stent before bifurcation has 80% stenosis.
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50% aortic
stenosis with a mean gradient of 41 mmHg and peak gradient of 60
mmHg , calculated valve area is 1 cm2 , mild aortic insufficiency ,
moderate mitral insufficiency , moderate tricuspid insufficiency ,
and mild pulmonic insufficiency. Carotid ultrasound revealed
right internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis , left
internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis. Pulmonary
function tests revealed FVC of 3.11 , 53% , and an FEV1 of 1.66 ,
35% predicted. Chest CT also performed on 5/29/06 revealed
cardiomegaly , massive calcifications involving the aortic valve
and coronary arteries , pleural thickening bilaterally , nodular
density measuring 7 mm in the lateral basal segment of the left
lung most likely represents round atelectasis or focal pleural
thickening , however , subpleural nodule cannot be excluded ,
recommending a repeat chest CT in six months after discharge , and
small ascites punctate calcifications in the pancreas.
PAST MEDICAL AND PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

ADMISSION LABORATORY VALUES:
Sodium 138 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 97 , CO2 32 , BUN 26 ,
creatinine 1.1 , glucose 66 , and magnesium 2. BNP is 2349. WBC
6.45 , hematocrit 31.6 , hemoglobin 9.9 , and platelets 192 , 000.
PT/INR of 1.3 , PTT of 33.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Kreidler was brought to the operating room on 8/13/06 where
he underwent an elective aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm
Carpentier-Edwards magna valve and a coronary artery bypass graft
x2 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
coronary artery. Total bypass time was 164 minutes. Total
crossclamp time was 127 minutes. Intraoperatively , the patient
was found to have a calcified trileaflet valve functionally was a
bicuspid due to effusion between the left and right cusp ,
moderate adhesions in the left pleural space , requiring
adhesiolysis to harvest the mammary artery. Transesophageal
echocardiogram post-repair revealed normal function of the aortic
prosthetic valve and mild mitral regurgitation , with intermittent
heart block following bypass predominantly with A pacing. The
patient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass without
incident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus
rhythm and in stable condition. Please refer to dictation
number 4691426 for the immediate postoperative course. The
patient was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on 7/26/06 .  The
patient's mental status waxed and waned with confusion , initially
was with sitters in the Step-Down Unit , and also was in a
rate-controlled atrial fibrillation , with a good blood pressure ,
and tolerated increasing beta-blocker. The patient's mental
status improved , did well off sitters , and continue with
rate-controlled atrial fibrillation. Mr. Salser was placed on
Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation. Neurologically , he
remained intact , and was placed on levofloxacin and vancomycin
for H. flu and Staph pneumonia , which are both sensitive to
Bactrim , and started on a 5-day course of Bactrim twice a day.
He was cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day #9.
DISCHARGE LABORATORY VALUES:
Sodium 137 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 99 , CO2 28 , BUN 18 ,
creatinine 0.9 , glucose 95 , and magnesium 1.7. WBC 12.07 ,

slow release 10 mEq daily with his Lasix , Bactrim double strength
one tab q.12 h. for five days , Plavix 75 mg daily , Lipitor 80 mg
daily , and Coumadin , the patient received 6 mg of Coumadin this
evening for his atrial fibrillation. He will be followed by
Ercoln Er Hospital Anticoagulation Service at
915-360-5305.
FOLLOW UP:
Mr. Moose will follow up with Dr. Quincy Hamernik in six weeks , his
cardiologist , Dr. Domenic Whang in one week in the Cardiology
Clinic Tions Medical Center .  He will also have a
follow-up chest CT to follow up on the 7 mm subpleural nodular
density in the left lung base in approximately six months that
will be set up by his primary care physician and cardiologist.
DISPOSITION:
He is discharged to home in stable condition with visiting nurse.

Discharge Date: 6/21/2003
Date of Discharge: 6/21/2003
ATTENDING: NOE DEMETRIUS MANDELLA MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Shortness of breath.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Pulmonary fibrosis.
2. Pulmonary hypertension.
3. Diverticulitis.
4. Acute renal failure.
5. Gout.
6. Hypertension.
7. High cholesterol.
8. Diabetes Mellitus.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-old
female with a past medical history of significant obesity ,
diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , heart failure ,
pulmonary fibrosis , on home O2 who presented with shortness of
breath , and left jaw pain on 8/10/2003 .  She had been in her
usual state of health until approximately 6 p.m. on the day of
admission , when at that time , she suddenly became short of
breath. She reports that she then sat down in her wheelchair and
""passed out."" However , it is unclear if the patient actually
lost consciousness. The patient also developed jaw pain
radiating to her back while EMTs were present and also complained
of a tug in her chest. The pain was unrelieved by nitroglycerin ,
oxygen; it was constant in nature. At the time of her arrival in
the emergency room , the patient was hemodynamically stable with
an O2 sat of 99% on room air. She was given sublingual nitrate
with no effect. Because of her history of coronary artery
disease , she was tried on heparin and aspirin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Pulmonary fibrosis , on home O2.
2. Reported history of an anterolateral MI.
3. Diabetes.
4. Hypertension.
5. High cholesterol.
MEDICATIONS: On admission , insulin 70/30 22 units q.a.m. 26
units q.p.m. , atenolol 25 q.d. , Zocor 20 q.d. , Zoloft 50 q.d. ,
Lasix 60 p.o. b.i.d. , Neurontin 100 t.i.d. , aspirin , and
multivitamin.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature was 97 , pulse
was 54-60 , blood pressure was 100-120/50-80 , and O2 sat was 98%
to 99% on 6 liters. She was a moderately obese woman in no acute
distress. Her lung are notable for crackles at the bases. Her
cardiac exam was notable for distant heart sounds with a normal
S1 , S2. She had no pedal edema in her extremities.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission were notable for a BUN and
creatinine of 31 and 1.1. Normal LFTs The patient's hematocrit
was 38. Her D-dimer was 736.
Her EKG showed normal sinus at low voltages , poor R-wave
progression.
IMPRESSION: At the time of admission , the patient was a
62-year-old female with morbid obesity and chronic episodes of
shortness of breath , this time accompanied by jaw pain and with a
history of coronary artery disease and multiple risk factors
concerning for acute coronary syndrome. The patient was
initially treated for a possible ischemic event. Diagnosis of PE
results were considered. However , the patient was not
tachycardic. She did not have any chest pain or new O2
requirements and had had several workups for pulmonary embolism
during prior hospitalization with similar systems , so therefore ,
this was thought to be less likely.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By system:
CARDIAC. In terms of ischemia , the patient had 3 tests of
cardiac enzymes , which returned negative. She was maintained on
telemetry , and she had EKG checked , which did not reveal any
changes. This was a patient who had a dobutamine MIBI , which was
negative for any evidence of ischemic changes. During the MIBI ,
there was no evidence of ischemia and/or scar. The patient was
continued on her outpatient medications including aspirin , Zocor ,
and atenolol. However , at a later point in her hospitalization ,
she became hypotensive at which time her atenolol was temporarily
DC'd , but this was restarted prior to discharge. In terms of the
patient's cardiac function , she has a history of CHF and is on
Lasix as an outpatient. An echocardiogram was repeated during
this hospitalization , which was notable for an EF of 60% ,
trace-to-mild MR , moderate TR , and estimated pulmonary systolic
pressure at 70 mmHg. The patient was continued on outpatient
Lasix regimen until at a later point during this hospitalization ,
the patient became hypertensive with acute renal failure at which
time her Lasix was discontinued. Lasix was restarted prior to
discharge. In terms of the patient's rhythm , she had no evidence
of arrhythmias monitored throughout her hospitalization.
GI. On 10/10/2003 , the patient developed acute onset of diarrhea
and lower abdominal pain. Now , this pain was nonradiating ,
alternating sharp and dull but constant , associated with nausea
and vomiting , and frequent stools. At times , the stools were
notable for bright red blood. The patient was therefore started
on levofloxacin and Flagyl as treatment for diverticulitis versus
ischemic colitis. To further evaluate this , a CT scan of the
abdomen was done , which was notable for a thickened colon for 10
cm at the hepatic flexure. Given this information , it was the GI
consult's opinion that this is most likely consistent with
diverticulitis , and the plan was to treat it aggressively with
antibiotics , and once the symptoms resolved , recommended a
colonoscopy several weeks after discharge. The patient was
continued on levofloxacin and Flagyl , but then , several days
later , became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the
80s. At this time , the patient's antibiotic coverage was changed
to include Ceptaz and vancomycin , and she also received 1 dose of
gentamicin. By the time of discharge , the patient's abdominal
symptoms have completely resolved. She is no longer having any
abdominal pain , and she needs no longer having any diarrhea and
is tolerating a regular diet without any difficulties. The plan
is for her to have a followup colonoscopy as an outpatient.
PULMONARY: The patient was admitted for shortness of breath. A
differential diagnosis at that time included chronic pulmonary
embolism versus cardiac etiology versus deconditioning in the
setting of a chronic pulmonary fibrosis. To establish that the
patient did not have any PE , she had lower extremity Doppler
exams , which were negative. She also had a PT protocol CT , which
was negative for any evidence of clots. Because the patient does
have cardiopulmonary hypertension , she was started on Coumadin as
prophylaxis for any thrombosis in the setting of her low flow in
her pulmonary vasculature. Throughout this hospitalization , she
was continued on her own home regimen of O2.
RENAL: The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency with
a baseline creatinine at 1.4 during this hospitalization at a
time that her diarrhea was very severe , and when her blood
pressures fell in the 80s , the patient developed acute renal
failure with a peak creatinine of 2.4 with decreased urine
output. The thought of the team was that this represented a
renal failure in the setting of her diarrhea , fluid losses , and
hypertension. Her pheno was consistent with this at 0.71. She
was treated with aggressive IV fluids. She also had a renal
ultrasound , which was normal. She did have 1 day of hematuria ,
which was thought to be due most likely to Foley trauma , which
resolved at the time of discharge.
ID: The patient's hospital course was notable for a diarrhea as
mentioned in GI. She was initially treated with levofloxacin and
Flagyl and then when she became hypertensive was then change her
Flagyl , Ceptaz , and vancomycin with 1 dose of gentamicin. Her
symptoms dramatically improved on these antibiotics on 9/18 she
was changed from IV antibiotics to a p.o. regimen of Flagyl and
levofloxacin. The plan is for her to continue a total of 14 days
of antibiotics. I anticipate the last day of antibiotic coverage
will be 2/19/2003 .
RHEUMATOLOGY: On 10/27/2003 , the patient was noted to have left
knee pain and was noted to have some focal lateral patellar
tenderness and swelling. A knee aspirate was performed and urate
crystals were identified , and the patient was diagnosed with
gout. Because of her chronic renal insufficiency and diarrhea ,
the decision was made to treat her gout flare with steroids , and
she is currently is on a steroid taper as treatment.
ENDOCRINE: The patient has a history of diabetes. She takes
70/30 insulin at home. She was initially continued on an
outpatient regimen; however , when she started to begin having
massive diarrhea , she was taken off her long-acting insulin ,
because she was not taking anything by p.o. At this time , she
was not tolerating a regular diet , and her insulin requirements
were increasing. It is recommended that as an outpatient , she
resumes one-half of her regular outpatient insulin dose for 1 or
2 days to ensure that her insulin requirements in her diet are
appropriate , and then , she should resume her regular insulin
dosage.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Include aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zoloft 50 mg
p.o. q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. ,
prednisone taper - which involves 10 mg of prednisone on 8/14
followed by 5 mg of prednisone on 10/27 , 1/24 , and 3/1 and
then stop , Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. , insulin 70/30 11 units
q.a.m. 13 units q.p.m. - once it is established that the patient
has returned to her regular diet , this dosage should be doubled

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease.
LIST OF PROBLEMS:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Status post MI.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
4. Hospital-acquired pneumonia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Zaspel is a 75-year-old female with diabetes , coronary artery
disease , status post CABG in 1995 , recent MIBI , stress test in
July with a small area of reversible ischemia inferiorly who had
peripheral vascular disease , right CVA status post IVC filter for
DVT , triple AAA , status post repair , COPD , who presented to
One Memorial Hospital with nausea of unclear source and deep lateral
T wave inversions in EKG leads V2-V6. She has noted intermittent
fevers at home to 102 and sent into the Camptown On Memorial Hospital by her
VNA. Please see discharge summary from Sheyfle Hospital for
more details. She was at that time on treatment for a left foot
diabetic ulcer on Augmentin. Over the last week prior to
admission , she had increasing nausea , diarrhea without abdominal
pain. She did have mild fevers and increased cough though she
had no chest pain , orthopnea or urinary complaints. At the
Cea Sto Valley Hospital , they noted that she had deep T-wave inversions
laterally and she was ruled out for DCS by cardiac enzymes. They
transferred her to Burns Memorial Health Care for consideration
of cardiac catheterization.

13. Aspirin 81 mg daily.
14. Lipitor 40 mg daily.
ALLERGY/ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS:
1. Sulfa , the allergic reaction is unclear , although it has
noted anaphylaxis on previous discharge summaries.
2. Theophylline causes tongue swelling.
3. Quinine reaction unclear.
4. Iodine/IV contrast. This is noted in the medical record.
However , the patient does not remember having an adverse reaction
or allergic reaction to IV contrast.
5. Iron , this reaction is unknown.
6. Erythromycin , again , the patient does not remember any
reaction , but apparently has hives.
7. Levofloxacin , unclear what the reaction is. She has
tolerated this in April , which she was treated for a foot
ulcer. It is not clear if this is a rash or it was thought to be
possibly related to a fever that the patient had , but it is not
clear what the actual reaction is.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient is an 80-pack-year smoker. He is currently smoking.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
Her temperature was 99 , her pulse was 98 , her blood pressure was
105/55. Her respiratory rate was 18 when she was saturating 94%
on room air. In general , she is in no acute distress. Her HEENT
exam was unremarkable. Her cardiac exam was regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Her lung exam was
notable for crackles most prominent in the left lower lobe. Her
abdomen was soft , obese , nontender and nondistended with good
bowel sounds. Her extremities were significant for erythema of
the left shin without warmth or tenderness. She also had a small
1.5 cm ulceration on the bottom of her left foot which has been
present for sometime although she says that it looks better than
at first. There was no purulence or purulent drainage from the
wound. Her neurologic exam was unremarkable.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:
Her labs were notable for a creatinine of 1.6 , a white count of
4.1 , with 11% eosinophils. Her hematocrit was 31.6 , and her
albumin was 3.
PROCEDURES:
Cardiac catheterization: it was done by Dr. Eeds .
FINDINGS:
Showed a right dominant circulation. There were no significant
left main lesions identified. The LAD had a tubular 90% lesion
and the diagonal I had a proximal tubular 60% lesion , there was
also a diffuse 80% lesion of the proximal circumflex. The RCA
had a proximal 75% lesion with a mid diffuse 60% lesion and a PLV
tubular 70% lesion. The coronary artery bypass grafts had a
patent LIMA to LAD graft , the SVG to marginal I had a 100% lesion
during this catheterization due to the moderate amount of
contrast and the patient's chronic kidney disease , they treated
the RCA and placed a 3 x 24 mm Taxus stent
ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
On 7/9/07 , showed an estimated ejection fraction of 50% with
inferoseptal and inferior severe hypokinesis. The RV was normal.
There was mild aortic stenosis. Mild-to-moderate aortic
regurgitation. The valve area was 1.2 cm2. There was mild
mitral regurgitation. There is trace tricuspid regurgitation
with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 36 mm plus right
atrial pressure.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: The patient was admitted because they had deep T
wave inversions in the lateral leads and are still concerning for
anginal equivalence of nausea and vomiting. It was decided on
admission that an echocardiogram would be performed and if there
was evidence of any regional wall motion abnormalities that she
would be taken directly to cath. The echocardiogram as noted
above showed inferior hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery
disease. She was taken to the cath lab on 9/5/07 and they show
two ____ that one of the bypass grafts was completely occluded
and was not visualized. They also saw that there was a proximal
RCA lesion 60% which was found to account for the inferior
hypokinesis given the right arm circulation. This was stented
with a Taxus stent. Because of her kidney insufficiency , it was
decided not to pursue the 80% left circ lesion and this was
deferred until later point as this was not thought to be causing
any problems. Her post cath ECG was unchanged and continued to
have the deep lateral T wave inversions. She did not complain of
any chest pain or nausea and vomiting during her admission. She
was started on aspirin and Plavix initially although as noted
below she did have an apparent allergy to Plavix and thus was
switched to ticlopidine 250 mg b.i.d. instead of Plavix for
anticoagulation. She was also continued Lipitor 80 mg daily ,
Lopressor 25 mg t.i.d. After her cath , it was originally planned
that she would go back to cath for intervention on the left
circulation lesion , however , given her other medical problems and
her relative stability hemodynamically and symptomatically , it
was decided that they would wait and decide later if this lesion
needed to be corrected in the future or not.
b. Pump: The patient had no significant issues with her blood
pressure here. She remained in a blood pressure range of 100-120
throughout her stay. She was continued on her beta blocker as
noted above. However , at discharge , this was switched back to
atenolol as her home medications and she refused to change
medications , she said that she would not be able to afford new
prescription. We did increase her dose of atenolol to 25 mg
b.i.d. from 25 mg daily as her requirement of beta blockade
seemed to be higher than what her home dose was. Given that she
has a concurrent renal disease , it would probably be useful for
her to be on an ace inhibitor ARB as well. This medication
should be added as an outpatient , if her blood pressure tolerates
it. It was on the lower side here , so we did not add it. We did
not diurese her in fact we held her Lasix on admission because
she seemed to be volume depleted given that she was admitted with
a lot of diarrhea , this again will need to be reconsidered if she
had increased edema. This can be restarted.
C: Rhythm: The patient was kept on telemetry , however , there
were no significant episodes of arrhythmias during her admission.
2. GI: The patient was admitted with persistent nausea and
diarrhea from Tlmamuthes Medical Center .  The diarrhea resolved one day
after admission. Her fecal leukocytes were positive but her C.
diff was negative. It was unclear what the etiology of this
diarrhea was and we were going to send a repeat stool study ,
however , she did not have any diarrhea afterwards and this may be
antibiotics associated diarrhea but it seemed to resolve
spontaneously.
3. Pulmonary: The patient was admitted with crackles in the
left lower lobe and some wheezing consistent with COPD and
pneumonia. A chest x-ray on admission showed a right lower lobe
infiltrate/atelectasis. We initially continued her on Augmentin ,
which she was taking for her diabetic foot ulcer. However , she
did not appear to clinically respond to this medication. We held
her antibiotics as noted below in the ID section and after that
her white blood cell count increased and she produced some
purulent sputum and Gram-negative rods. The Gram-negative rods
were later speciated as serratia although this information is not
available at the time of her discharge. She was treated for a
hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftazidime to
complete a 14-day course. Clinically , she appeared to improve on
this regimen , although her white count was still elevated at 15
on discharge , however , given her overall clinical stability , the
lack of fevers and the lack of systemic symptoms. We felt
comfortable with discharging her with close follow up.
4. Infectious disease: The patient was initially admitted on
Augmentin for a diabetic foot ulcer , the notes from Grantnas Healthcare by the Infectious Disease Service recommended a 2-4 week
course of Augmentin for her diabetic foot ulcer. She had
completed three weeks of therapy and thus we discontinued this
medication as it did not seem that there was really any evidence
of active infection in her foot. After holding the antibiotics
for three days , her white count began to rise and she developed a
purulent cough as noted above , this was thought to be a
hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was treated with vancomycin and
ceftazidime and she will complete a 14-day course of these
antibiotics.
5. Endocrine: The patient was home on oral hypoglycemics. She
was switched to coverage with an insulin scale. Her sugars were
relatively well controlled and she did not require much in the
way of supplemental insulin.
6. Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease. Her baseline
creatinine was 1.5-1.6. She was admitted and had a cath. She
was given Mucomyst and bicarbonated fluids for renal protection
during her dilute. Because of the risk for kidneys , the cath was
done with a little amount of dye as possible. Her creatinine
remained stable throughout her admission and settled out at 1.6
of her creatinine which is the baseline.
ALLERGY:
During the patient's admission , it was noted that she developed a
rash on 4/15/06 .  She was seen by the Allergy and Immunology
Service at the request of the cath lab given that there was
concern that she had this rash because of her Plavix. They felt
that this was possible. This was the most likely etiology and in
conjunction with her high eosinophil count it was felt that this
was a drug reaction to the Plavix. She was switched to
ticlopidine 250 mg b.i.d. and her rash appeared to improve. She
was also given claritin as well as put on a brief prednisone
taper given her diffuse rash and her brisk eosinophilia. She
should follow up with Allergy and Immunology in about one month
to see if the rash has resolved and potentially to try
rechallenge with Plavix at that point.
Cellulitis/diabetic foot ulcer: The patient has had a
longstanding diabetic foot ulcer which has been treated by wound
care VNA and was treated at Tha Hospital .  We continued the
Augmentin to a total course of three weeks and then stopped it.
We continued her dressing changes and this will be followed by
the VNA at home. There was no evidence of active infection ,
there was no purulence or erythema around the area of the ulcer
and the erythema around the foot appeared to be stable , this was
most likely chronic venous stasis change and not a true
cellulitis as there was no warmth or tenderness in this region.
CONSULTANTS:
Allergy/Immunology , the attending was Dr. Frija .
PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISCHARGE:
The patient was afebrile. Her pulse was 86 , her blood pressure
was 120/60 , her respiratory rate was 20. She was 92-96% on room
air. In general , she was in no acute distress. Her JVP was
about 7 cm. She had small amount of crackles at bilateral bases.
Her cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and
S2. There was a 2/6 systolic murmur most prominent at the left
lower sternal border. Her abdomen is soft , nontender , and
nondistended with good bowel sounds. She had 1+ edema
bilaterally with small amounts of erythema at the distal end of
the left lower extremity which has been stable. There is no
associated warmth or tenderness. She did have a 1.5 cm small
ulcer on the ventral aspect of her left foot , which did not have
any purulence associated with it. Her neurologic exam was
nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:
Notable for a creatinine of 1.5 , a white blood cell count of
15.89 , with 82.7% neutrophils , 3.8% eosinophils. Her hematocrit
was 28.6. Her baseline appears to be around 30.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Ticlopidine 250 mg by mouth twice a day.
2. Atenolol 25 mg by mouth b.i.d.
3. Lipitor 80 mg daily.
4. Prednisone taper 30 mg on 10/18/07 , 20 mg on 10/3/07 , 10 mg
on 10/18/07 and then stop.
5. Vancomycin 1 g IV daily , course to be completed on 1/16/07 .
6. Ceftazidime 1 g daily to be complete on 1/16/07 .
7. Allopurinol 100 mg daily.
8. Neurontin 300 mg three times a day.
9. Tessalon perles as needed.
10. Ativan 0.5 mg at bedtime as needed for sleep.
11. Glipizide 2.5 mg daily.
12. DuoNeb every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath.
13. Lasix 30 mg by mouth daily.
14. Aspirin 81 mg daily.
DISPOSITION:
Home with services.
PENDING TESTS:
As noted , the patient had a sputum culture that was growing
Gram-negative rods at the time of discharge. The current report
is that it was growing Serratia marcescens which should be staph
sensitive to ceftazidime , which he was prescribed for a total of
14 days.
FOLLOW UP:
She will follow up with Dr. Antony Baldonado on 10/12/07 at 9:30
a.m. She has an appointment scheduled.
TO DO LIST:
1. The patient has an 80% left circumflex lesion which was not
stented. This should be , ___28.20__ , whether she needs a second
intervention in the future. She does appear to be asymptomatic ,
but she does continue to have the deep lateral T wave inversion
suggesting the areas of abnormal blood flow in the heart. It was
thought that the right RCA lesion was more likely to be the cause
of her inferior wall hypokinesis , so that was the procedure
performed.
2. The patient was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with
vancomycin and ceftazidime. This will continue until 1/16/07 .
She was noted to have a rash here which was thought to be Plavix
related. If the rash resolves on ticlopidine , she may need to
readdress whether or not this was actually due to Plavix. It was
recommended that she follow up with an allergist in about a month
from her hospitalization who can review the records and determine
whether she should start Plavix or maintain on the ticlopidine.
3. Her platelets should be monitored given that she started on
ticlopidine and there is a risk of TTP associated with this
medication.

Discharge Date: 2/12/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: CHIEF COMPLAINT was a 57 year old man
who was status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty times 2 , of a left anterior
descending stenosis for unstable angina , and was admitted for new
onset of angina at rest. The patient's cardiac risk factors
included family history , borderline high cholesterol. The patient
had no prior cardiac history , until 12 of June , when he had substernal
chest pain with exertion. He eventually had cardiac
catheterization which showed an 80% proximal left anterior
descending lesion with thrombosis , good left ventricular function.
The patient had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to
this lesion. He was without symptoms for about 4 weeks , and then
in 23 of August , the patient noted new onset chest pain and left arm
numbness at rest. An electrocardiogram at that time showed sinus
bradycardia at 50 , T-wave inversions in II with flat T-waves in
III , and was otherwise unremarkable. He had an exercise tolerance
test at the time and went on a 9-minute standard Bruce protocol and
stopped secondary to fatigue. The electrocardiogram showed 3 to 4
millimeter ST depressions in the lateral leads , which was highly
predictive of coronary artery disease. At that time , he was repeat
cardiac catheterization which showed a restenosis of his left
anterior descending lesion. He had a repeat percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of the lesion without
complications. The patient did well for several weeks and was
pain-free. However , 6 days prior to admission , the patient began
to note occasional episodes of left arm numbness , which was always
relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. There was no accompanying
dizziness , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis. The patient at first had
2 or 3 episodes a day , now increased to 7 or 8 times a day at the
time of admission. On the day of adimssion , the patient had almost
constant chest pain and arm pain which lasted almost all day , only
partially relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient was
very concerned about the pain , and now comes to Tes Healthcare for further evaluation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY included
arthritis , kidney stones , chronic lower back pain. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION were Lopressor 25 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
aspirin 325 milligrams by mouth per day , Isordil 10 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day. ALLERGIES included no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the patient was a retired firefighter ,
occasional red wine , no tobacco use. His brother had 3 myocardial
infarctions in the past , no other FAMILY HISTORY.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile , pulse 54 , blood
pressure 104/70 , respirations 20. There was
no jugular venous distention. Chest was clear. Cardiac
examination showed regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no
peripheral edema. Extremities had good pulses bilaterally in
dorsalis pedis , posterior tibial and femoral.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Admitting laboratory values were
remarkable for potassium 4.3 , creatinine
1.0 , hematocrit 40.8. The electrocardiogram showed sinus
bradycardia at 50 , normal intervals , flat T-waves in AVF , V2 and
V3 , QRS axis 0 degrees. Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or
effusions , no evidence of congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on a rule out myocardial
infarction protocol. He had no elevations in his
serum creatinine kinase levels. The patient continued to have
intermittent left arm numbness during his hospital stay. For this
reason , he was taken back for cardiac catheterization , which showed
a 75% proximal left anterior descending lesion believed to be at
the same site as his previous percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty procedures. The patient had successful percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of the lesion with a 25% residual
stenosis. The patient postoperatively had no further episodes of
chest pain or arm numbness. He had no complications related to the
cardiac catheterization itself. The patient was then discharged.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE will be Lopressor 25 milligrams by mouth
twice a day , Ecotrin 1 tablet by mouth per day , diltiazem 60
milligrams by mouth twice a day. The patient was to FOLLOW-UP with
his cardiologist in 1 week.

GILM COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery
disease , chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin , pulmonary
hypertension , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism
who presented in 5/25 with an apparent perforated appendicitis
for which she was taken to the operating room. Final pathology
during this procedure was serositis. Her postoperative course
was complicated by severe delirium , atrial fibrillation ,
abdominal abscesses requiring IR drainage in 10/10 and 10/7 .
The patient began having recurrent UTI , decreased appetite and
hematochezia at this time. On 8/17/05 , a CT of the abdomen
showed evidence of a colovesical fistula and the patient was
admitted to the Ore Of for further management.
On admission , she was found to be in acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 2.3 apparently secondary to dehydration after
recently having been started on Lasix for hypertension by her
primary care physician.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Pulmonary hypertension.
3. Chronic atrial fibrillation , on Coumadin.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Asthma.
6. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
7. Hypothyroidism.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Appendectomy in 5/25 .
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Atrovent b.i.d.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the Anorwin Hospital .  Her creatinine
improved with IV hydration on 3/25/05 .  She was taken to the
operating room for exploratory laparotomy , cystoscopy with
bilateral urinary stent placement , sigmoid colectomy with primary
anastomosis and diverting ileostomy. During the surgery , she
became hypotensive requiring pressors due to inability to replace
IV fluid adequately. She was transferred to the surgical
intensive care unit , intubated on pressors. For the first
several days , she had a inflammatory response-type picture with
significant vasodilation requiring pressors and massive IV
resuscitation greater than 30 liters of fluid. Sedation was
slowly weaned as the patient's respiratory status improved. Due
to a question of responsiveness during the first several days , a
head CT was performed which showed no evidence of stroke. She
became slowly more responsive as sedation was weaned with the use
of Precedex and was extubated on 1/22/05 , postoperative day 7
without complications. Her mental status in the intensive care
unit continued to improve. The remainder of the patient's
hospital course will be dictated via systems.
Neurologically , at the time of transfer out of the ICU , the
patient was noted to have subtly improving mental status. Her
family described her at baseline. During her stay on the floor ,
her Zyprexa dose was decreased. She had no further neurologic
issues.
Cardiovascular: In the intensive care unit , the patient required
vasopressin initially and was weaned off during the first three
or four days. Her chronic atrial fibrillation continued. She
was transferred out of the intensive care unit on IV Lopressor
which was gradually converted to p.o. as she tolerated a regular
diet. She was discharged on 100 mg q.i.d. of Lopressor.
Respiratory: In the intensive care unit , she was noted to have
respiratory failure initially secondary to a SIRS picture and
fluid overload. This significantly improved with diuresis. She
was transferred out on a nasal cannula. On the floor , she had no
respiratory issues. She continued her aggressive chest physical
therapy and was out of bed with physical therapist.
GI: In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient was noted to have a
postoperative ileus. She did not tolerate NG tube feeds. A post
pyloric Dobhoff was eventually placed and tube feeds were
initiated. After transfer out of the intensive care unit , the
patient had difficulty with her Dobhoff catheter and eventually
became clogged and had to be removed. A speech and swallow
evaluation was obtained. A bedside swallow was equivocal and a
fiberoptic swallow was done. She passed this with fine colors
per the speech and swallow team and they recommended that her
diet be advanced as tolerated. She was discharged to
rehabilitation on a regular diet.
GU: In the Intensive Care Unit , she was massively resuscitated
initially and then diuresed for virtually the remainder of her
hospital course. An initial Lasix drip was then changed to IV
Lasix boluses. She was discharged on p.o. Lasix at an equivalent
dose to her standing Lasix during her hospitalization. A
cystogram was obtained prior to her discharge to rehab at the
time of dictation. The result of the cystogram are not
available. If no extravasation is noted , her Foley catheter can
be removed at rehabilitation. If extravasation is noted , she
will need to undergo a repeat cystogram at some point in the
future prior to removal of her Foley catheter.
Heme: The patient was initially on subcu heparin due to concern
for bleeding. She was then started on a heparin drip and was
discovered that she had bilateral lower extremity partial DVTs.
Her heparin drip was titrated to a PTT of 60 to 80 prior to
discharge to rehab. Her heparin was discontinued and she was
started on Lovenox as a bridge to coumadinization. Her Coumadin
began during the few days prior to her discharge when she was
tolerating p.o. intake.
ID: Due to the colovesical fistula , concern for some liver
opacities on her original abdominal CTs , she was placed on
broad-spectrum antibiotics perioperatively. All antibiotics were
removed on 1/22/05 .  She was noted to have a candidal UTI ,
completed a five-day course of fluconazole. A small fever in the
Intensive Care Unit warranted blood cultures being sent and
repeat blood cultures on 10/4/05 eventually noted a
gram-positive cocci. It was felt that this was likely due to a
contaminant as the patient by that time had been afebrile for
several days. However , she was started on vancomycin for
gram-positive cocci , bacteremia. Her central line was removed
and a new central line was placed and she was discharged to rehab
on day 9 of 14 of IV vancomycin via her central line. After the
completion of this course of therapy , her central line may be
removed at rehabilitation.
Wound: Due to some drainage from abdominal wound due to her fat
necrosis , the lower portion of the wound was opened. There was
no evidence of active infection noted and a Vac sponge was placed
initially on 10/4/05 to facilitate the healing process. The Vac
was changed every three days during her stay. This most recent
change was on 10/30/05 .

DIAGNOSIS: OSTEOARTHRITIS LEFT HIP.
STATUS POST OSTEOTOMY FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS
OF THE RIGHT HIP.
HISTORY OF SLEEP APNEA.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: LEFT TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT BY DR. KOBA ON
22 of April .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46 year old male with
left hip pain , now worsening over the
past year , unrelieved with conservative therapy. The patient has a
history of congenital dysplasia of the hip , which was treated with
osteotomy of the right hip in 1988 , with good improvement. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY was also remarkable for sleep apnea. ALLERGIES
included intravenous pyelogram dye and shrimp. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION were none.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese white male in no
acute distress. He ambulated with a truncal
lurch to the left. Head and neck were within normal limits. Lungs
were clear. Cardiac examination was regular. Abdomen was obese ,
but benign. The left hip was remarkable for being 3/4 inch longer
than the right leg. Flexion was limited to 90 degrees , with 10
degrees lacking full extension. External rotation was 30 degrees ,
internal rotation 0 , abduction 30 degrees with increased pain , and
adduction 20 degrees. The patient's neurovascular examination was
within normal limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 22 of April , and
underwent left total hip replacement which he
tolerated well. Estimated blood loss was 400 cc. The patient was
in stable condition for the entire hospital stay. His immediate
postoperative hematocrit was 36.3. The patient was febrile for the
first postoperative day , but rapidly defervesced on perioperative
antibiotics with Ancef. On postoperative day #2 , hematocrit had
dropped to 29 and the patient received 2 units of autologous blood ,
which increased his hematocrit to 36. The patient remained stable
over 30 for the rest of his hospital course.
The incision was examined on postoperative day #1 , and was found to
be clean and dry. The patient started physical therapy on
postoperative day #1 , and made rapid progress. The patient was
anticoagulated with Coumadin for a prothrombin time in the range of
14 to 16 , and stabilized at a dose of 8 milligrams per night. At
the last dose , his prothrombin time had gone up over 16 and he was
changed to Coumadin 5 milligrams by mouth at hour of sleep. The
patient was cleared by the Physical Therapy Service and cleared
medically for discharge home on postoperative day #6.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. The patient
is to FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Mcfadden in 5 weeks.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE included Coumadin for a full 6-week
course , Percocet as needed. The patient will FOLLOW-UP with the
Coumadin Program through this hospital. The patient had no
problems with his breathing and will require no special therapy at
this time. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was good.

Discharge Date: 1/22/2005
ATTENDING: NAVAS , ROBT MD
DISPOSITION: Short-term rehab.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: MSSA bacteremia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 87-year-old man with a
history of bioprosthetic aortic valve , status post PPM and ICD
placement , who is transferred from Ties The Whiash County Hospital for workup
of bacteremia and concern for sepsis and endocarditis with early
evidence of multiorgan failure. He is 13 years' status post
bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and also has a history of
afib with diastolic heart failure and a permanent pacemaker , on
Coumadin therapy. Ten days prior to admission to the Josesanderstlake Medical ,
he had extraction of all his remaining teeth. Following that , he
had a gradual onset of malaise , shortness of breath , and general
weakness. He was admitted to Sonbyrd Lanor Community Hospital following a
fall to the ground where he was found to be febrile with
leukocytosis and there was a question of left lower lobe
infiltrate. Blood cultures at Kimau Hospital Of quickly returned positive
with Staphylococcus aureus. PE was performed , which was negative
for vegetation , but the patient's oxygen requirement increased
and his blood pressure seemed to be dropping , and thus he was
transferred to Lo Memorial Hospital for further workup and management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Afib , hypertension , diastolic dysfunction ,
echo in 1999 with moderate concentric LVH and EF of 65% , right
heart catheterization in 2000 showed elevated right heart filling
pressures and wedge pressure which increased with exercise ,
cardiac output of 4.4 , status post 27-mm bioprosthetic AVR and
ascending two grafts in 1992 , afib with diastolic heart failure ,
left bundle-branch block , permanent pacemaker , hypothyroidism ,
type II diabetes , obesity , distant cholecystectomy , AAA , status
post repair ( ? ) , thrombocytopenia , gout , prostate cancer , status
post hormone therapy , and diabetes mellitus.
MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission were lisinopril 5 q.o.d. ,
allopurinol 100 b.i.d. , glyburide 6.25 q. day , levothyroxine 100 ,
Zoloft 50 , Protonix 40 , Lasix 60 , and Coumadin 2.5.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his daughter who is very
supportive and his wife in Ver He is retired. No
history of tobacco or alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam , the patient appeared ill. He was
slightly lethargic. Slightly uncomfortable. His oxygen was 96%
on 4 L of oxygen. Heart rate 70s. Blood pressure in the low
80s. Temperature 99.1. HEENT: Notable for slightly elevated
JVP. His lungs showed decreased breath sounds at the left and
right base with rales up to one-third on the right side. His PMI
was nondisplaced. He was in an irregular S1 , normal S2 with no
rubs or gallops. There was a 1/6 systolic murmur at the base.
JVP was approximately 15 cm. Pulses were 2+ and equal
bilaterally. No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. He was oriented
to person , time , and generally to place , but not to date. His
remainder of neurological exam was grossly intact.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Notable for a potassium of 4.3 , BUN 36 ,
creatinine 2.5 , white count 8.1 , hematocrit 39.4 , CK and
troponins were negative , and INR 2.0. Chest x-ray on admission
showed a question of a left lower lobe infiltrate by report. It
also revealed a left pleural effusion with a question of
infiltrate and a right pleural effusion. EKG showed afib , left
axis deviation , and left bundle-branch block. Echo done at the
bedside shows an EF of approximately 45% to 50% without gross
regional wall motion abnormalities with some paradoxical motion
consistent with left bundle-branch block. There is no obvious
vegetation , but this was a limited study.
HOSPITAL COURSE AND PLAN PER SYSTEM:
Shortly after admission to the Cardiology Team , the patient
continued to have borderline blood pressures. His blood cultures
again grew out MSSA and his oxygen requirement increased and he
was transferred to the CCU for central monitoring and further
supportive care. In the CCU , he was continued on antibiotics.
Initially , the patient was on vancomycin for concern for MRSA.
When his cultures came back , he was switched over initially to
Ancef and gentamicin and then on consultation with ID to
nafcillin. The patient briefly required pressors , but then after
receiving IV fluids and continued antibiotics , his blood pressure
normalized to approximately 90 to 100.
Remainder of hospital course by system:
1. ID: The patient had repeated Gram-positive bacteremia with
MSSA up until the January , 2005 , after which time his daily
cultures have shown no growth to date. As above , the patient
will be maintained on nafcillin , gentamicin was discontinued , and
the patient was started in rifampin on 5/24/05 , both antibiotics
which he should continue for at least 4 to 6 weeks. Daily blood
cultures do not need to be resumed unless the patient has a
temperature at which point he should be cultured. He has been
afebrile for the last 3 to 4 days prior to discharge. We did not
do a TEE as the patient is likely not a surgical candidate and he
was felt to be at very high risk of intubation , should he become
septic again or spike temperatures this would be reconsidered.
In the interim , the patient should continue with antibiotics and
follow up with ID Clinic in approximately 3 to 4 weeks.
2. Cardiac:
Ischemia: The patient had a very small troponin leak of 0.15 on
March , 2005 , otherwise his troponins were negative. This was
likely demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis. After the
patient's blood pressure improved , we started him on a low-dose
beta-blocker , which he should continue. We held his ACE as his
blood pressure was generally about 90 to 100. If his blood
pressure improves slightly , we would recommend restarting the ACE
as an outpatient.
Pump: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and
an EF of 40%. He was slightly fluid overloaded after transfer
back from the CCU in the setting of getting fluids for sepsis.
He was diuresed intermittently very gently with IV Lasix at 20 ,
which seemed to improve the patient's shortness of breath and
wheezing , which correlated with the patient being more wet. He
was restarted on his own Lasix of 60 , for which he should
continue and also recommend having the patient receive daily
weight checks and to adjust Lasix in order to maintain daily
weight.
Rhythm: The patient is afib with left bundle-branch block
occasionally and RVR at Ening Health , which seemed to
correlate with fevers. But , he had a normal rate while inhouse
especially while on beta-blocker. He has an AICD , which seemed
to be working fine inhouse as well as a pacemaker.
2. Pulmonary: The patient has maintained on 2 to 3 liters at
which he is saturating at 93% to a 100%. He will likely need
oxygen for a few more days as some of his remaining fluid is
taken off. Please check oxygen saturations daily and titrate off
oxygen as he is able to.
3. Renal: The patient is with chronic renal insufficiency ,
baseline of 1.7. His range in the hospital was 1.7 to 2.5.
Pheno was checked which was approximate 33% and he did not have
any urine Eos or caths to suggest allergic interstitial nephritis
or ATN. Please repeat a creatinine in one week to ensure that it
remains stable. I suspect that as some of his fluid is taken
off , his flow will be better and his creatinine will be slightly
improved.
4. Endo: The patient is with diabetes. He was initially on
Portland protocol while in the Intensive Care Unit. On the
floor , he was maintained on NPH and a Regular Insulin sliding
scale. He should continue on NPH and this should be titrated in
order to maximize blood sugar control , so he should continue on a
Regular Insulin sliding scale. Once the patient is ready for
discharge to home , he should be switched back to his oral
hypoglycemics.
5. Heme: We held the patient's Coumadin or anticoagulation as
it is contraindicated in the setting of endocarditis. Now that
his sepsis seems to resolve , the patient should be restarted on
his Coumadin in approximately 3 to 4 days after discharge with a
goal of an INR of 2 to 3.
6. Psyche: The patient remained generally oriented to person
and situation to hospital while inhouse , but occasionally slide
down especially in the setting of having fevers. He was
continued on his home Zoloft and we added a small dose of
Zyprexa , which seemed to also help. The patient benefits from
regular reorientation which we suggest continuing.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient is to receive heparin t.i.d. and
PPI for DVT and ulcer prophylaxis respectively.
8. Access: The patient now has a PIC line , which is in place
and can be used for IV antibiotics.
DISCHARGE DIET: His discharge diet is a 2-g sodium ADA 1800 to
2000 calories per day , low saturated fat , low cholesterol , and
mechanical soft.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: His discharge medications are as follows;
Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. 6h. p.r.n. pain or temperature , aspirin 81
mg daily , Colace 100 b.i.d. , Lasix 60 p.o. daily , heparin 5000
units subcutaneous t.i.d. , NPH 16 units q.p.m. , Regular insulin
sliding scale a.c. and h.s. , Levoxyl 100 mcg daily , rifampin 300
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zoloft 50 p.o. daily , Atrovent nebulizer 0.5 mg
nebs q.4h. p.r.n. wheezing , nafcillin 2 g IV q. 4h , Zyprexa 2.5
mg p.o. nightly , miconazole 2% powder topical b.i.d. to rash ,
Advair Diskus 250/50 one puff inhaled b.i.d. , Duoneb q. 6h.
p.r.n. wheezing , Protonix 40 mg daily , Toprol XL 25 mg p.o.
daily , and allopurinol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
TO DO: The patient should follow up with his cardiologist Dr.
Gebauer and his PCP Dr. Lowell Blass once discharged from short-term
rehab. In addition , the patient should be seen by ID Clinic in
approximately 3 weeks to discuss remaining antibiotic therapy.
In addition , the patient should have a set of labs drawn in
approximately 5 to 7 days to recheck his creatinine. Please
check blood cultures if the patient has a temperature. Please
assess the NPH regimen as above. Please restart his Coumadin at
2.5 mg in 3 days with a goal INR of 2.3.

2. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
3. STATUS POST CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT.
4. CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
5. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
6. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70-year-old man with
a history of non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease , status post three
vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1993 , chronic atrial
fibrillation , and hypercholesterolemia , who presents with
complaints of recent flu-like symptoms times two days , including
right sided chest pain exacerbated by breathing and coughing , and
nonproductive cough with chills. The patient is followed by Dr.
Strubbe of the Hufi General Hospital , and by Dr. Torri of the
Onas Medical Center cardiology team. The patient recalls flu-like symptoms in
early April 1996 , but otherwise , was well until two days ago
when he noted the onset of right sided , sharp chest pain which was
well localized to the right chest , worse with breathing and chest
movement. The patient denied any similarity to previous anginal
pain , which he noted is more substernal in nature and has not
occurred in months. The patient was concerned that the pain was
cardiac and took two sublingual nitroglycerin without relief , and
therefore , presented to the Swebrothers Hospital Emergency
Room. The patient denied any nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis ,
shortness of breath , abdominal pain , melena , constipation ,
diarrhea , and hemoptysis , at the time of admission. He notes
history of chronic venostasis disease in his lower extremities with
bilateral decreased sensation and episodes of neuropathy pain which
has not changed recently.

q.supper , Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. Sunday , Saturday ,
Tuesday , and Thursday , and 2.5 mg p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday , and
Friday , Nitro-Dur patch 8.4 mg q.a.m. off in p.m. , alprazolam up to
2 mg p.o. q.day p.r.n. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. p.r.n. swelling , usually
one time per week , and Tylenol p.o. p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , vital signs
included a temperature to 101.4 , pulse 92 ,
respirations 28 , blood pressure 170/74 , and O2 saturation 89% on
room air with 94%-95% on two liters O2. HEENT examination revealed
moist mucous membranes without lesions. Pupils were equal , round ,
and reactive to light. Extraocular muscles were intact. Neck had
no LAD or JVD. Lungs had crackles present with egophony and E to A
change over the right low lateral lung field , otherwise , clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Heart had an irregular rhythm with a
regular rate. There was a II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
right upper sternal border and left lower sternal border. There
was normal S1 and S2 , no S3 or S4. Abdomen was soft , nontender ,
and nondistended with positive bowel sounds. Extremities revealed
1+ bilateral pitting edema with bilateral changes of chronic
venostasis , 1+ pedal pulses on the left , but left foot slightly
cool to touch. There was no palpable pulse in the right lower
extremity , but good capillary refill and warm. Neurological
examination revealed cranial nerves II-XII were intact bilaterally.
Motor was intact bilaterally. Sensory was intact to light touch
with decrease in sensory to light touch bilateral lower
extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count was 21.12 , hematocrit
38.8 , and platelets 191. INR was 2.1 , PTT 42.3.
Sodium was 136 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 98 , bicarbonate 25 , BUN 16 ,
creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 279. Admission EKG was significant for
atrial fibrillation at 76 beats per minute with evidence for cold
left bundle branch block. Chest x-ray was significant for right
middle lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor for
administration of intravenous antibiotics. The
patient did well overnight. In the a.m. of 4/5/97 , the patient
had an episode of hypoxia with increased requirement for oxygen and
ultimately required 100% face mask for 93% O2 saturation. The
patient denied any anginal chest pain , nausea , vomiting , or
increased shortness of breath. A stat EKG revealed no changes.
Stat chest x-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary edema. This
responded well to IV Lasix. However , the patient continued to
require increased amounts of oxygen over the next two days wherein
he had further episodes of pulmonary edema requiring p.r.n. IV
Lasix. During this time , blood cultures from the time of admission
grew out Pneumococcus times two which were sensitive to penicillin.
The patient's broad coverage antibiotics were then changed to IV
penicillin. An echocardiogram obtained on 4/5/97 revealed a high
normal left ventricular size with mild concentric hypertrophy ,
hypokinesis with inferior septum , and inferior posterior region ,
ejection fraction 45% , normal RV size and function , left atrial
enlargement , mild to moderate mitral regurgitation , and no aortic
stenosis or insufficiency. The patient was initiated on Captopril
which was then increased titrating with the patient's blood
pressure over his hospital stay. The patient , during his hospital
course , was also noted to have increased blood sugars to the 450
range. Therefore , he was started on a sliding scale insulin
regimen.
The patient improved with regards to his hypoxia and , on the
morning of 6/15/97 , he was breathing room air with an O2
saturation of 93%. His lung examination was significant for only
rare rhonchi on the right side. Chest x-ray of 3/4/97 revealed
improvement of his right lung pneumonia with persistence of
bilateral effusions consistent with his episodes of pulmonary
edema. Fingerstick glucose was 164 reflecting an overall
improvement and decreased need for sliding scale insulin. The
patient was felt to be well and ready for discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Coumadin 2.5 mg
one p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday , and Friday ,
and two p.o. q. Sunday , Saturday , Tuesday , and Thursday , Nitro-Dur
patch 0.4 mg per day to be removed at night , Captopril 25 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.a.m. , penicillin-V 500 mg p.o. q.i.d.
times seven more days , Mevacor 20 mg one p.o. q.p.m. , and glipizide
5 mg one p.o. q.a.m. and two p.o. q.p.m.
DISPOSITION: The patient is to be discharged. He will be staying
with family and is to follow up with the Aer Medical Center
cardiology team in 10 days. He is also to follow up with his
Ilos Bao Hospital doctor within three weeks. The patient is not
expected to have any disability and should recover well. He has
been instructed to call should he develop a high fever , further
chest pain , or shortness of breath.

ATTENDING: GABBY , TROY M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Sensabaugh is a 79-year-old f
emale
with a history of Ehlers-Danlos , osteoarthritis and left knee
replacement in 1998 , and left hip replacement in 2002 who was leaving her
primary care physician's office and was hit by the elevator door and fell to
the ground. She suffered a left periprosthetic fracture of her left distal
femur. She was initially admitted to Manteton Hothood Medical Center where
she was found to have , by report , a closed distal femur fracture
between her prior ORIF and TKR with no neurovascular deficits.
Operative intervention was referred by Seases Ryn Owish General Hospital due
to her medical problems and she was treated conservatively with
nonweightbearing and a knee immobilizer. Her course there was
significant for a hematocrit drop requiring 2 units of PRBC's as
well as being ruled out for an myocardial infarction. In addition , she also
had a negative MIBI test. She was transferred to DCHO for further management.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives in an apartment in Hiscall Hunt Laranseat Mother
recently deceased. No alcohol. No tobacco.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 98.8 , heart rate
75 , blood pressure 100/50 , respiratory rate 18 , and saturations
94% on room air. No acute distress. Regular rhythm and rate.
No murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Lungs , clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended.
Positive for colostomy. Left lower extremity in knee
immobilizer , swollen and tenderness to palpation. Left lower
extremity slightly externally rotated. Bilateral EHL/tibialis
anterior/gastrocnemius intact distally with 5/5 motor. Sensation
to intact to light touch and SPN/DP/sural/tibial nerves/saphenous
distributions. Bilateral 2+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Sodium 137 , potassium 3.6 , chloride 114 ,

9. White count 11.6 , hematocrit 39.6 , and platelets 170. INR
1.1 , PT 14.2 , and PTT 21.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Upon admission to SHAMC ,
Ms. Sovel underwent an echocardiogram to rule out any ca
rdiac
abnormalities. Her ejection fraction was revealed to be 50% with
no wall motion abnormalities and only mild aortic insufficiency.
She was determined to be medically stable to go the operating room by Internal
Meidicine. On January , 2005 , she underwent an open reduction
and internal
fixation of her left femur fracture with a LISS plate placement.
Postoperative film showed good placement of hardware and good
alignment of her fracture. Her postoperative course was
complicated only by mild hypotension ( systolic blood
pressures in the 70s ) and by shortness of breath. She was
successfully treated with fluid boluses and inhaled nebulizers
respectively. Postoperative chest x-ray revealed lower lobe
atelectasis. Once she was more mobile by postoperative day #3 ,
her blood pressure and O2 saturation stabilized. The remainder
of her postoperative course was uncomplicated. She was kept on
perioperative antibiotics and as well as prophylactic Lovenox
while in house. She was kept touchdown weightbearing on her left
lower extremity. Her dressing was removed on postoperative day
#2. She was evaluated by physical therapy who worked with her to
increase her activity. She was deemed safe for discharge to
rehabilitation. Upon discharge , her left lower extremity was
neurovascularly intact. Her incision was clean , dry , and intact
and healing well. She is discharged in stable condition with
instruction to continue Lovenox and left lower extremity
touchdown weightbearing status until followup in clinic in two
weeks.
TO DO PLAN:
1. Touchdown weightbearing , left lower extremity.
2. Follow up with Dr. Lassetter in two weeks.
3. Continue Lovenox until next appointment with Dr. Macnaughton .

PRINCIPAL PROBLEM: Vascular insufficiency.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: Diabetes mellitus , known vascular disease ,
incontinence , recurrent UTIs , hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 89-year-old woman with
insulin dependent diabetes , coronary
artery disease , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , and
ejection fraction of 28% who had a left fem-peroneal bypass in the
past presented with on-going left toe pain admitted for left toe
vascular insufficiency and cellulitis refractory to treatment for
two months. The patient reported having her podiatrist clip her
nails about two months ago which is when her pain in her foot
started. She denies any fever , chills , cough , shortness of breath ,
nausea , or vomiting. At home she was able to ambulate , but had
significant pain localizing to her left foot and toe. She was
recently admitted here on July for the same
complaint treated with IV levofloxacin and clindamycin for five
days and then went home on ten days of dicloxacillin , then Keflex.
She comes back on the April with the same pain
and infection in her left foot. On admission she was afebrile with
mild tachycardia and stable blood pressure. Exam was notable for a
soft systolic ejection murmur at the base , non-palpable pulses in
her left lower extremity. Left foot was cool. There was swelling
over the dorsum of her left foot to the ankle. There was a
superficial ulcer along the medial aspect of the nail bed without
purulence. She had normal white blood cell count and negative
blood cultures taken here.

Non-palpable pulses in lower extremity. NEUROLOGIC: She was
intact. Able to ambulate with some difficulty and pain.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for recurrent vascular
insufficiency with superimposed cellulitis likely
due to her poor lower extremity perfusion from her peripheral
vascular disease. An MRI was obtained which was concerning for
early osteomyelitis and there was concern that her bypass graft in
her left leg was not patent. She had angiography of the left leg
vessels and proceeded to get stenting of the left common iliac and
external iliac vessels without complication on May .  Also
during her hospitalization she had elevated LFTs which were
attributed to a three gram dose of Unasyn that she received in the
Emergency Room. The Unasyn was changed to IV clindamycin and levo ,
and a right upper quadrant ultrasound showed a calcified
gallbladder wall and no obstruction , and her LFTs then began to
normalize. Her cardiac status remained stable throughout her
admission and she is to be treated with Plavix 75 mg for 30 days
after the stenting of her iliac vessels. A PICC line was placed on
the day of discharge for on-going IV antibiotics
PLAN: The plan is as follows: 1. Plavix times 30 days , 75
milligrams a day. 2. IV clindamycin and p.o. levofloxacin
for another ten days , and then switch to p.o. Flagyl and
levofloxacin for an additional four weeks. 3. She is to follow-up

bilaterally. There was no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium was 138 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 102 ,
bicarb 25 , BUN 28 , and creatinine 1.0. Glucose
was 255. White count was 5 , hematocrit 37 , platelets 151. Calcium
was 8.7. PT was 12 , PTT 23 , INR 1.1. Urinalysis showed 3+
protein , 1+ ketones , 3+ blood , positive nitrites , no WBCs.
IMPRESSION: L3-4 herniated disc.
PLAN: The plan was for the patient to undergo L4 hemilaminectomy.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on June , 1999 , to the
Neurosurgery service. After consent was signed ,
he was taken to the Operating Room. The patient underwent left L4
hemilaminectomy. The surgeon was Dr. Defosses . The anesthesia was
general. Estimated blood loss was 1000 cc. There were no
complications. The patient was stable post-extubation and was
transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit. The patient was then ,
after observation , transferred to the regular neurosurgery floor ,
Ra The patient did well postoperatively. However , it was noted
that the patient was not able to void when the Foley was
discontinued. Thus , a Genitourinary was consult was obtained on
June , 1999. It was noted that the patient had his own
urologist , Dr. Burdsall . for a previous problem of benign prostatic
hypertrophy. It was recommended by the Genitourinary consult that
he be started on Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q d. , to try a second voiding
trial. On the repeat voiding trial , the patient was able to void
on his own , voiding 1700 cc on postoperative day three. The
patient was also referred for Physical Therapy and Occupational
Therapy consults to evaluate his physical therapy. It was
recommended that the patient be discharged with home physical
therapy as well as home occupational therapy. Today , on October ,
1999 , the patient is in good spirits. He is feeling well. His
T-max is 99.2 , heart rate 80 , blood pressure 130/80 , respiratory
rate 16. O2 saturation is 94%. Is and Os shows 2100 in and 2800
out. The patient is an obese white male , alert and oriented x 3 ,
with fluent speech. He has no drift. Cranial nerves were grossly
intact. Strength and sensory were intact in all four extremities.
His wound was clean , dry , and intact. The assessment was that the
patient was feeling well.
The patient had a positive urinalysis on admission. He was started
on levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q d. x 4 days for his presumed urinary
tract infection.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home with home physical
therapy and occupational therapy in stable condition.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow up with Dr. Wilbur Hambric in
approximately one week in his clinic. The patient is
also to follow up with Dr. Rickenbacker in approximately one week if he
continues to have any problems with his voiding. He was given Dr.
Kirkendall number , 003-3132.

Discharge Date: 2/5/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Raffo is a 59-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery
disease status post small non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in
October of 2000 and also status post cardiac catheterization with 2
vessel disease , small left PICA cerebrovascular accident ,
congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in October
revealing an ejection fraction of 30%. Also diabetes mellitus type
II complicated by retinopathy , nephropathy and question neuropathy.
History of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia as well who
presented to Dr. Bouie clinic on May , 2001 with
progressive increasing dyspnea , increasing abdominal girth and
weight gain over the past few months.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus x 20 years , chronic renal
insufficiency with the last creatinine in
January of 3.5 , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
30% in October of 2000 , coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction , October 2000 question f silent myocardial
infarction x 2 , history of hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin daily , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day ,
Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg p.o. q day , toprol XL
50 mg p.o. q day , insulin 70/30 65/45 , Actos 45 q p.m , Avapro 300
mg p.o. q day , Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , sublingual nitroglycerin
p.r.n..
PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.1 , blood pressure 116/70 , pulse 88 ,
primary care physician of 18. The patient appeared
to be in no acute distress. Jugular venous pressure approximately
13 cm water. LUNGS: Faint bibasilar rales. CARDIAC:
Tachycardia , regular rhythm without murmurs. ABDOMEN: Positive ,
normal active bowel sounds. Obese , distended and nontender.
EXTREMITIES: 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulse , 2-3 plus edema
bilaterally to the knees.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: It was felt that given notes
of thyroid dysfunction , his history was
consistent with fluid overload. His jugular venous pressure was
elevated and he had 3plus pitting edema to the knees without
significant rales on chest exam. He was aggressively diuresed with
doses of Lasix 200 mg b.i.d. IV as well as Zaroxolyn. Weight on
admission was 135 kilograms and on discharge he was down to 132
kilograms. A repeat echocardiogram at Ethool Hospital
showed an ejection fraction of 30-35 , left ventricular dimensions
of 47 mm , 1 plus mitral regurgitation and global hypokinesis as
well as moderate right ventricular dysfunction. Abdominal
ultrasound showed no ascites despite extremely distended abdomen
and right renal cyst x 2. Follow up abdominal CT also showed there
was no mass or ascites and his distended abdomen was likely due to
adipose tissue. Diuresis was limited by acute and chronic renal
failure and oliguria. Diuresis was held from May , 2001.
Right heart catheterization on February , 2001 showed mildly
elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and moderately elevated
right ventricular pressures. Dopamine was started on June ,
2001 to aid with renal perfusion and diuresis and he was then
weaned off of that on July , 2001. His Lasix was stopped on
July , 2001 and he auto-diuresed until the time of discharge
with stable blood pressure. He remained stable with no dyspnea at
rest and is symptom free at the time of discharge.
2. Renal: His basic chronic renal insufficiency is likely
secondary to poor diabetic control with a creatinine of 2.5 on October , 2001 , 3.3 at the time of admission. Acute renal failure with
increasing creatinine of 6 after aggressive diuresis with a mean of
0.8 percent. Renal function improved with creatinine of 4.1 on
July , 2001 with autodiuresis. The renal service was
consulted to comment on the nature of the patient's renal
insufficiency and acute renal failure as well as to assist in the
use of vasodilators.
3. Endocrine: He has a long standing history of type II diabetes
complicated by retinopathy and neuropathy and nephropathy. He was
maintained on his outpatient endocrine regimen during his stay.
The patient was discharged home with services. He is to follow up
with Dr. Marro on November , 2001 at 3:30 p.m. , with Dr. Loatman on

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Pt is a 65 yo w/CHF presenting w/episode of Vtach
at outside hospital. Pt. felt somewhat nauseous on coming home from
work on day PTA. Wife noticed pallor when he came home , called
ambulance. Was found to be in monomorphic Vtach to 200 which responded
to lidocaine. Lidocaine drip d/c'd in AM of transfer in the abscene of
further VT. Pt found to have troponin of 0.8 at
outside hospital. It was initially unclear if the pt had an ischemic
event which caused VT , or if the pt's VT caused a bump in cardiac
enzymes. Pt also has anginal equivalent w/jaw pain which
worsens when the pt carries heavy things or walks
up flights of stairs. Recent outside echocardiogram showed EF 15-20% ,
w/ global hypokinesis. PE onadmission w/JVP 10 cm , faint crackles ,
II/VI SEM worse w/inc. afterload. EKG , unchanged from
11/1 .
HOSPITAL
COURSE 1. Ischemia - The patient was admitted to the cardiac
service. Given the presence of vtach and a slight EKG bump , and
clinical signs of heart failure , the initial presentation was
suspicious for CAD. The
patient was initially diuresed slowly , however , the pt began to develop
worsening HTN and shortness of breath along w/a prolonged episode of
vtach and was subsequently
diuresed aggressively by approximately 5 L. The patient was also
loaded w/amiodarone. The patient's weight also dropped 5 kg. Left and
right
coronary catheterization were performed and revealed only a discrete rt
PDA lesion 60% and a discrete 60% D1 , otherwise essentially clean. No
interventions were
necessary. The right heart catheterization revealed a PCWP of 6 after
the diuresis. The patient had no further vtach episodes on amiodarone
and was discharged on 400 mg qd of amiodarone.
The patient had an
ICD placed on 3/16/2004 .  The initial plan was for the patient to also
have his aflutter ablated to decrease the propensity for vtach ,
however , the presence of a lt atrial clot could not be ruled out during
TEE , so rhythm ablation was deferred. An transthroracic echocardiogram
was
also performed prior to discharge which revealed EF of 30% , w/anterior
akinesis and global hypokinesis. A broad differential diagnosis for his
heart failure was entertained , however no conclusive etiology could be
determined. The patient is to follow up with his cardiologist and his P
CP. These appointments were coordinated by the attending physician ,
Dr. Versteegh . He should also follow up w/Dr. Yafuso as described in that
section. For the patient's afib , he should take coumadin , 5 mg , for the
next three nights and should subsequently drop down to 2.5 mg qd ,
unless differently as suggested by his INR which should be drawn on
Monday , May , and Wed September by the VNA. The patient should call an
MD immediately w/chest pain , sob , or pallor. The patient's blood
pressure medications were also significantly adjusted to maximum doses
while the patient was under close acute care monitoring to facilitate
optimization of his outpt regimens. Additional changes at the
discretion of the pt's PCP , Dr. Schwarm . The patient also presented w/an
elevated creatinine which slowly returned to normal levels during the
hospitalization. The elevated creatinine was most likely due to a
combination of hypoperfusion secondary to vtach , and dye load from
catheterization.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
F/u as described above. INR on June .  Stop old medications.
Take only medications as prescribed from here.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Gerache is a 59 yo man with poorly controlled diabetes , asthma
who presented with chest pain. Over the past few weeks he has had
intermittent chest pain with activity , lasting 5 minutes , relieved
with rest. He also has shortness of breath when he
climbs stairs , but he said that this is more from
his asthma. He presented to his PCP because of
a finger injury , and then told him about the
chest pain. Pt was sent to the ED. He has
been chest pain free since the day before admission.
His finger sticks at home have been in the 200-300 range.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV - ischemia: Mr. Wanzer had a cardiac catheterization on the mor
ning of 10/06 .  He has had 3 sets of negative enzymes ( elevated CKMB but
negative troponins ). EKG significant only for j point elevation
diffusely.
-beta blocker was started
-cholesterol was checked ( elevated triglycerides 308 , total cholesterol
146 , HDL 29 ). Baseline LFTs checked.
-statin was started
-aspirin was held because of the patient's stated allergy to aspirin
( causes asthma type symptoms )
-will start patient on low-dose lisinopril
PUMP: no prior echo , consider as outpatient. appears
euvolemic.
rhythm: no active issues.
2. ENDO - on insulin at home but rarely checks his sugars. when he
does it's usually 200-300s. Hemoglobin A1c is 10.7.
Patient was continued on home regimen of NPH insulin but clearly needs
better control of his sugars as outpatient.
3. PULM:
pt says he has had asthma as a child. no record of PFTs but should
obtain as outpatient. Home inhalers continued
4. RENAL: Mr. Gaulding currently has good renal function but needs to
have his Cr checked after starting the lisinopril.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You must have your kidney function checked within 1 week , please make
an appointment with your primary care doctor. Please take your
medications as instructed. Please follow up with Dr. Shiley , your
cardiologist within 4-6 weeks.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Please consider carefully your lifestyle , including your diet and
exercise plans. Although you did not have blockages in your heart
vessels requiring stenting , you have started to have blockages , so the
best thing you can do is to slow this process down. This includes
losing weight through diet and exercise , taking medications including
statin , beta blocker ( atenolol ) and ACE inhibitor ( lisinopril ).

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Septic arthritis and bacteremia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 54-year-old male with factor IX hemophilia , HCV with
cirrhosis and chronic ascites , HIV , diabetes , end-stage renal
disease on dialysis , and history of multiple infections including
mitral valve endocarditis , and bilateral knee replacement and
left hip replacement who was transferred from rehab with a
painful right knee in a prosthetic joint which was concerning for
a septic joint. He was in his rehab therapy one week prior to
admission when he twisted his knee. He gave him some factor IX
at this time with some relief , but in the intervening time , it
had become more painful , red and swollen , and was unable to walk
without great difficulty where as before he had been tolerating
rehab with a walker without incident. In addition , he had a
temperature to 103.0 degrees , two days prior to admission and was
given vancomycin and gentamicin dialysis the day prior to
admission. The knee , however , continued to worsen , and he has a
significant restriction in range of motion , and he reported to
the emergency department for concern for an infected knee versus
hemarthrosis. He reported some fatigue and decreased p.o.
intake. He did have chills with his fever. He denied any
shortness of breath , chest pain , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting
or bleeding. Of note , he has chronic ascites , which for the past
three months has required paracentesis three times weekly with a
total of 3 to 4 liters taken off each time. In the emergency
department , he was loaded with factor IX by the hematology
fellow. The knee was then tapped by Orthopedics , which
demonstrated only some dark blood and minimal fluid. He was
admitted to the Renal Service given that he is a dialysis
patient.

1. Hemophilia factor IX deficiency.
2. Hepatitis C virus with cirrhosis and chronic ascites.
3. HIV.
4. End-stage renal disease , on dialysis.
5. Diabetes type 2.

transfusion. He is not currently working.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Notable for factor IX deficiency hemophilia.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
The patient was afebrile , slight tachycardiac at 105 , and
normotensive at 120/72 , sating well on room air. General: He
was cachetic and chronically ill appearing , alert and oriented ,
and comfortable. Neck veins were flat. Cardiovascular exam was
notable for regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 , S2 and a 3/6
holosystolic murmur at the apex. Chest was notable for mild
bibasilar crackles , otherwise clear. Abdomen was distended ,
notable for flank dullness. He did have normal active bowel
sounds and a peritoneal port on the right. Extremities were
notable for being wasted , warm with absent pulses. Right knee
was erythematous , edematous , and extremely tender to palpation.
LABS ON ADMISSION:
Notable for potassium of 5.2 , BUN of 42 , and creatinine of 4.2.
His liver function panel was within normal limits. His white
blood cell count was 10.4 , hematocrit 36.6 , and platelets
332 , 000. His PT was 15.4 , PTT 62.3 , and INR was 1.2. X-ray of
his right knee demonstrated an effusion and no fracture. A chest
x-ray demonstrated a small left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
His erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 70.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
On 8/22/04 , he had an incision and drainage of his right knee by
Dr. Moelter of Orthopedics. On 10/20/04 , he had a
hemodialysis-tunneled catheter placed by Interventional
Radiology. On 2/7/04 , he had a PICC line placed at the
bedside , and he underwent hemodialysis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Musculoskeletal and Infectious Disease: He was admitted to
the Renal Service for treatment of septic arthritis of his right
knee , which was a prosthetic joint. Blood cultures were positive
for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus , which was the
organism , which had caused his prior endocarditis. He underwent
incision and drainage of his right knee by Orthopedic Service ,
Dr. Majka , on 8/22/04 .  In addition , his hemodialysis catheter
was pulled on 10/15/04 because it too had grown blood cultures
positive for MSSA. He had no further positive cultures once his
dialysis catheter was pulled except for 1/4 bottles coag-negative
Staph from 9/23/04 , which was attributed to contamination. He
was treated with vancomycin and gentamicin just after dialysis.
He received a total of seven days of gentamicin and was on day
#14 of a six-week course of vancomycin upon discharge. He had
some low-grade temperature during admission but only one
temperature spiked to 101 degrees. Both Orthopedics and
Infectious Disease Services were consulted and followed him
throughout admission. Orthopedics and Infectious Disease
consultant determined that if any blood cultures became positive
after removal of the hemodialysis catheter , he would need to
return to the OR for joint exploitation. Given his negative
culture this did not occur and he is discharged with prosthetic
joint in place. The joint fluid culture as well synovial tissue
and synovial culture from his I&D were positive for MSSA.
Surveillance cultures were negative for seven days following the
procedure. He was instructed to continue vancomycin for a total
of six-week course and to follow up with Infectious Disease in
two months. He was cleared for physical therapy and returned to
rehab by Orthopedics with instructions to remove his sutures
three weeks after discharge and to follow up with Orthopedic , Dr.
Glader , as indicated by his symptom.
2. Hematology: He has factor IX deficiency hemophilia for which
he normally takes q. week or twice weekly factor IX before
dialysis. During admission , he was initially loaded with factor
IX in the emergency department for arthrocentesis. Hematology
was consulted and they recommended b.i.d. factor IX 4000 units
during admission while the situation regarding surgery and line
placement was unclear. He continued receiving b.i.d. factor IX
until the day of discharge as his last line was placed on that
day. He was to return to factor IX before dialysis only upon
return to rehab and was to follow up with Dr. Tutson , his
primary hematologist. In addition , he received erythropoietin
with dialysis.
3. Renal: He has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis
Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays. He continued this regimen
while he had his hemodialysis catheter in place , however , when
that was removed , he was dialyzed to a temporary femoral artery
catheter and only as clinically indicated. He was dialyzed most
recently on 10/20/04 after his dialysis catheter was replaced by
Interventional Radiology , and he should return to his Monday ,
Wednesday , Friday schedule. He was continued on his home renal
supplements. He was continued on erythropoietin with dialysis
and midodrine.
4. GI: He has HCV cirrhosis and chronic ascites and history of
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as well as upper and lower GI
bleed. He had no evidence of bleeding during admission. The
occult blood was negative x3. He additionally had no evidence of
infection or SPP. He was taped by a peritoneal port thrice
weekly with removal of 3 to 4 liters of fluid each time. The
first set was sent for culture , which was negative.
Additionally , he was continued on his b.i.d. proton pump
inhibitor given his history of upper GI bleed.
5. Endocrine: He has diabetes for which he was covered with
Regular Insulin sliding scale upon admission. Given some
elevated blood sugars up to 300s and the risk of bacteremia , he
was started on NPH and was discharged on 10 q.a.m. and 5 q.p.m.
with continued Regular Insulin sliding scale for added coverage.
6. Prophylaxis: He was not anticoagulated despite his
immobility. Given his hemophilia , he was placed on TED hose and
pneumoboots and continued on his PPI.
7. FEN: Nutrition was consulted because of his low albumin and
general cachexia. He was placed on a 1.5 liters fluid
restriction and 2 g sodium restriction given his chronic ascites.
He is also on a diabetic diet and renal diet. Nutrition
recommended supplementing with Enlive and Ensure , and the patient
had adequate oral intake during admission. He was not given IV
fluids.
DISPOSITION:
He has full code. He was discharged in stable condition to rehab
with instructions to follow up with his new primary care doctor ,
Dr. Ezequiel Strawn , Orthopedics as needed by symptoms with his
regular hematologist , his regular renal physician , and with

Discharge Date: 3/15/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
PROCEDURES PERFORMED: October , 1997 , coronary artery bypass graft
times three with left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending artery , and saphenous vein graft to diagonal
one.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Effner is a 74 year-old
gentleman , status post inferior
myocardial infarction in 1995 , and percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex in September , 1995. The
patient is also status post stenting of the left anterior
descending artery in September , 1996. After that time , the patient
continued to have chest pain , although with decreased frequency and
intensity. The patient did receive Ticlid for six to eight weeks
following the stenting.
The patient presented with increased frequency and duration of his
chest and epigastric pain. The patient denied shortness of breath ,
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , diaphoresis , nausea or
vomiting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , hyperlipidemia , paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation in 1982 , osteoarthritis and diet controlled
diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES: Amoxicillin , which gives him arthritis.
MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d.;
Imdur 120 milligrams p.o. q.a.m. and 60 milligrams
p.o. q.p.m.; Cozaar 100 milligrams p.o. q.a.m.; Atenolol 50
milligrams p.o. q.d.; Norvasc 5 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has no smoking history and rarely
drinks alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Sclerae are anicteric. Oropharynx without
lesions. Carotids 2+ without bruits. The
neck is supple. The lungs are clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular examination is a regular rate and rhythm with an S4.
Normal S1/S2. Abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended , with
normal active bowel sounds. Extremities are without edema.
Dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse and femoral pulses
are 2+ bilaterally without bruits in the femoral arteries.
Neurological examination is without gross focal abnormality.
LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count 9.8 , hematocrit 40.8.
Glucose 188 , creatinine 1.8. CK 40.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Service
for management and evaluation of his angina. He
underwent cardiac catheterization on June , 1997 , demonstrating
90% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis , 99% diagonal
one ostial stenosis; circumflex was okay. The right coronary
artery had a mid stenosis of 50%. The patient arrived in the
Catheterization Lab with mild angina on 200 micrograms per minute
of intravenous nitroglycerin. Post catheterization , the patient
developed 5/10 chest pain with an increasing pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure to 40 and D-waves of 52. Increasing the
nitroglycerin led to resolution of these changes. The patient had
intra-aortic balloon pump placed via the right femoral artery with
return of the wedge to approximately a mean of 6 and his pain was
relieved. The patient returned to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit
where he underwent aggressive heart rate and blood pressure
control. He was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery and taken to the
Operating Room on October , 1997 , for coronary artery bypass
grafting times three as described above. The patient was
transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Electrocardiogram
remained unchanged. He was extubated without difficulty. The
intra-aortic balloon pump was removed. The patient was noted to
have slight confusion on postoperative day number one and two.
Lopressor was restarted and the patient was gently diuresed. His
chest tubes were discontinued. On postoperative day number three ,
the patient was noted to be slightly more confused with left facial
droop and aphasia that resolved with mild left lid lag in the early
afternoon. The patient was evaluated by Neurology. A head CT scan
was performed , demonstrating no hemorrhage or acute stroke. There
was a small left cerebellar hemisphere lesion that was believed to
be consistent with a lesion that was greater than 24 hours old.
The patient , however , became progressively encephalopathic. The
patient underwent an echocardiogram and carotid studies , which
demonstrated no evidence of embolic source. The patient's
expressive aphasia and facial weakness , however , recurred. The
patient again underwent head CT scan , demonstrating acute right
parietal infarction that appeared cortically based. Given the
recent intra-aortic balloon pump placement , the aorta could not be
ruled out as a source for embolus. Therefore , heparin was started ,
as was Coumadin. The goal INR is 2 to 3. Also the patient had a
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , and although had no
evidence of atrial fibrillation , there was concern over potential
cardiac source for embolization. The patient's aphasia and left
facial droop improved steadily. He was evaluated by the Speech and
Swallowing Service. He had no difficulty with swallowing; however ,
it was felt that he would benefit from language therapy in addition
to his physical therapy and occupational therapy. The remainder of
the patient's course was uncomplicated from a cardiac standpoint.
His chest x-ray prior to discharge demonstrated very small left
sided effusion without any significant failure.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to rehabilitation
for reconditioning and intensive speech , physical
therapy and occupational therapy. He will follow-up with Data Medical Center
Cardiology in one to two weeks. He will follow-up with Dr. Bost
in four to six weeks. He will receive physical therapy ,
occupational therapy and speech therapy. He must also follow-up
with his internist , as he has been requiring a sliding scale
insulin dosing , with previously diet controlled diabetes.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol #3 one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h.
p.r.n. pain; Colace 100 milligrams p.o.
t.i.d.; sliding scale insulin; Lopressor 50 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.;
Coumadin , with goal INR of 2-3 , to be dosed q.d. after checking a
prothrombin time.

therapy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69-year-old man
without prior cardiac history. He has
cardiac risk factors including possible hypertension , and possible
history of hypercholesterolemia. The patient has had a history of
atypical chest pain , including a cardiac workup in the past with an
echocardiogram in 1995 showing concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy , asymmetric septal hypertrophy. He had a normal
ejection fraction at this time. In October of 1997 , he had an
exercise tolerance test at which time he went eight minutes , with a
maximal heart rate of 151 , maximal blood pressure 226/90 , and no
electrocardiogram changes. At 2 p.m. on the day of admission he
developed substernal chest pain with a crushing tightness ,
radiating to both shoulders and his jaw. He was not short of
breath. He experiences pain on and off through the afternoon ,
although the pain was never completely gone. At 6 p.m. , he became
acutely worse , and at that time called the EMT and was brought to
Nama Emergency Department. Within the
Emergency Department , the patient was noted to have ST elevations
in the inferior leads. He was enrolled in the NPA/TPA trial.
Infusion was begun at 8:15. The patient was given Lopressor ,
oxygen , morphine , aspirin , and heparin. He did not drop his
pressure with sublingual nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history includes prostate
cancer in September 1997 , status post XRT , as well
as a possible transient ischemic attack in 1990.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Medications included Zantac p.r.n.
FAMILY HISTORY: Family history was negative for coronary artery
disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married with three children. He
denies any tobacco or alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission
demonstrated a well-appearing black male in
no acute distress. Vital signs were a heart rate of 48 , blood
pressure 83/30 in the Emergency Department , he was afebrile , with
oxygen saturation level 99 percent on two liters. HEENT
examination , the oropharynx is benign , he had a left facial droop.
The neck was supple , 2+ carotids without bruit. Jugular venous
distention was normal. The chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally. The heart had a regular bradycardic rhythm with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur. The abdomen was soft , non-tender ,
non-distended , positive bowel sounds , no organomegaly. The
extremities were warm and well-perfused , no clubbing , cyanosis or
edema , trace distal pulses. Neurologically , he was alert and
oriented x three , cranial nerves 2 through 12 are grossly intact
except for a left facial droop. Motor and sensory were grossly
intact.
ADMISSION LABORATORY: Admission labs showed a sodium of 144 ,
potassium 4.2 , chloride 108 , bicarbonate of
22 , BUN 16 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 136. White count was 8 with a
hematocrit of 35 , platelets were 239 , CK was 276 with an MB of 0.8.
Troponin on admission was 0.0. INR was 1.0 , partial thromboplastin
time was 22.6. The patient's first electrocardiogram in the
Emergency Department showed normal sinus rhythm at 70 with
first-degree AV block , axis of 56 degrees. He had ST elevations of
4 millimeters in leads 3 and aVF , 3 millimeters in 2 , ST depression
0.5 to 3 millimeters V2 through V5 , 1 and aVL. Chest x-ray did not
showed acute disease in the Emergency Department.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Within the Emergency Department , the patient
initially had resolution of his electrocardiogram
changes , but had persistent jaw pain , remaining at 5/10. He was
taken to catheterization , which demonstrated a mid right coronary
artery lesion of approximately 95 percent with a clot , but with
TIMI-III flow. No intervention was done at that time. The patient
initially required vigorous intravenous hydration to maintain good
blood pressure , but remained essentially stable and pain-free. He
had a drop in hematocrit from 35 on admission to 28 after his
catheterization secondary to blood loss of the right femoral triple
lumen site placed in the Emergency Ward prior to tPA , blood loss at
catheterization , small hematoma and dilution. He was given two
units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in his
hematocrit. The patient was then transferred to the Floor , where
he maintained his good course. He had no postcatheterization or
post myocardial infarction chest pain. The decision was then made
to take the patient back to the Catheterization Laboratory to have
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stenting of
this lesion , and to see if it continued to persist.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Serafine is a 78-year-old gentleman who presented with
increasing dyspnea on exertion and New York Heart
Association Class III heart failure. The patient also complained of fatigue
over the last four years prior to admission. He currently denied
any angina , diaphoresis , nausea , orthopnea , PND , presyncope or
syncope. The patient had been treated with serial transthoracic
echocardiograms which revealed an ejection fraction worsening
from 60% down to 40% along with aortic stenosis. The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization , which revealed no significant coronary artery disease
and elevated left and right
heart filling pressures. Cardiac catheterization was abandoned
prematurely due to the increasing filling pressures. Echocardiogram was
performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 40% , aortic stenosis with a
mean gradient of 31 mmHg , a peak gradient of 50 mmHg , calculated valve
area of 0.7 cm2 , mild mitral insufficiency , mild tricuspid
insufficiency , mild left atrial enlargement , moderately

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Delcour was brought to the operating room on 7/9/07
where he underwent a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement
with a 25-mm Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve. Total bypass
time was 101 minutes , total crossclamp time was 63 minutes. Intraoperatively ,
the patient was found to have a calcified trileaflet
aortic valve. The patient came off bypass without incident , was brought to the
Intensive Care Unit on 3 mcg of epinephrine and insulin and
Precedex. The patient did well and was brought up in stable
condition in normal sinus rhythm. Postoperatively , the patient
was extubated and the Electrophysiology Service was consulted to
evaluate his internal pacemaker which was reprogrammed and
functioning well. The patient continued to require vigorous
diuresis with a Lasix drip. He was extubated on postoperative day #1 without
incident. The patient was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on
postoperative day 5. The patient experienced some postoperative
tachycardia and his beta-blocker was increased with good result.
He was also found to have a positive urinary tract infection and
was started on ciprofloxacin for a total of five days. The
patient at one point required 5 liters of nasal cannula to get
his saturations in the 90s. He did continue to require
intravenous Lasix but had weaned Lasix drip and had intermittent
boluses of 40 mg IV to promote diuresis with good result. He was
weaned off his oxygen and the patient began to ambulate and was

treatment for lower extremity cellulitis on 10/9/2003 at Stongarfo Hospital .  He was doing well and cellulitis was
improving and participating in physical therapy until 2 weeks
when he became progressively increased shortness of breath with
exertion. He has orthopnea at baseline but no PND , no increased
swelling of lower extremities , also had increased daytime
sleepiness ____ conversation while eating earlier in the day than
previously.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denies fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting ,
cough , or abdominal pain. He reports occasional chest pain at
rest lasting 2-3 minutes without radiation not associated with
shortness of breath or diuresis. His last episode of chest pain
was 3 days ago. He denies palpitations. He has had 3 episodes
of gross hematuria but no abdominal pain , no frequency , or
dysuria. Also complains of shoulder and neck pain , cramping ,
constant at 4/10 , not improved or worsened with movement , not
better or worsened anytime of the day. Rehab reports increased
ammonia on his labs. The patient has been given increased doses
of lactulose and has now continuous diarrhea times several days
but no blood in his stool. The patient urinates every 1-1/2
hours.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for obesity , obstructive sleep
apnea , restless legs syndrome , hypertension , congestive heart
failure , right ventricular hypertrophy , status post MI with an
echo in October 2003 showing EF of 70% , diabetes , peripheral
neuropathy , and new light chain gammopathy , chronic renal
insufficiency , cellulitis , panniculitis , venous insufficiency ,
frequent UTIs , and BPH.
MEDICATIONS: His medications on admission are the same as his
medications on discharge.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , he was afebrile. His vital
signs were stable. He was sleepy , unable to stay awake
throughout the interview. His neck was supple. His JVP was 15
cm. His chest had crackles at the bases. His heart was regular.
His abdomen was obese. His extremities were warm , well perfused
and wrapped. On neurologic exam , he was alert and oriented x3 ,
sleepy , with poor dentition , decreased reflexes throughout ,
decreased sensation below the knee , no asterixis , but an
intention tremor.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascularly , he was continued on his home
medications and given IV Lasix , ____ 1-2 liters , negative. An
echo showed an EF of 40-45% with global dysfunction but no
regional wall motion abnormality. His BNP was checked on
admission and was found to be 761. He was kept even to negative
daily at the time of discharge. He was euvolemic on Lasix 80 mg
p.o. b.i.d.
Pulmonary wise , he has obstructive sleep apnea. The patient
provided his own CPAP and that was checked by respiratory and
found to be adequate.
Renal wise , he had a chronic renal insufficiency with a
creatinine baseline at 4. The goal was to have him negative 1
liter per day. A renal ultrasound was checked that was within
normal limits and showed no hydronephrosis.
ID wise , his UA was positive. A Foley was placed on admission
for volume monitoring. He had too-numerous-to-count whites on
admission and received 5 days of Augmentin for presumed UTI.
Endocrine wise , he has diabetes. He was admitted on glyburide
and this was discontinued secondary to rise in creatinine. He
was placed on subcutaneous NPH insulin and regular sliding scale ,
which may be changed over to p.o. glucose control agents as an
outpatient.
The patient was discharge to Chimoff Hospital for further care ,
wound dressing care for his lower extremity ulcer , and PT and OT.
On discharge , he was stable.
PLAN: Plan is to follow up with Dr. Mead regarding his
pulmonary status , to rehab for further PT/OT and wound care. The
patient needed his CPAP mask replaced and humidifier added. He
should be on CPAP 16 cm of water while sleeping. He was to
follow up with Dr. Teddy Lands in Nephrology , Dr. Dungey in
Hematogy , and his PCP , Dr. Rubin Lortz .

Hospital course:
This is a lovely 79 year-old lady with multiple risk factors for
atheroscosis , including long standing HTN with evidence of LVH on Echo
from 2004 , DM II complicated by neuropathy , hyperlipidemia , and age.
She presented with overt symptoms and clinical signs of congestive heart
failure , including complaints of progressive shortness of breath , PND ,
fatigue , and peripheral edema. Her physical exam was significant for an
elevated JVP , lower extremity edema , pulmonary rales , laterally displaced
PMI , and S3 gallop , all consistent with heart failure. Even though the
patient had cardiolmegaly on CXR from 2004 , her LVEF was about 60% ,
suggesting a recent development of CHF. Her EKG showed NSR with new LBBB ,
and no QW. Due to her multiple atherosclerotic risk factors , new LBBB ,
and evidence of neuropathy , the initial impression was that she had a
recent ischemic event. Three sets of cardiac enzymes were negative
during her first 24 hours stay. She had a stress MIBI showing no
scars or evidence of reversible ischemia with a calculated EF of 23%. An
Echo showed dilated LV , with globaly reduced LE function and near normal
pulmonary pressures , suggestive of dilated cardiomaypathy. Extensive
interviewing of the patinet was negative for other possible etiologies of
HF , TSH and A1C were normal , and and the cause of her dilated CMP
remained undifined. she was diuresed to a dry weight of 57Kg , responded
well to PO Lasix ( 40-60mg ) , treated also with Toprol XL 25mg , and
Spironolactone 12.5mg. Her symptos completely resolved both at rest and
with gentle ambulation. One can argue toward evaluating her coronaray
arteries either by cath or CTA to exclude balanced ischemia. However
considering her age , no changed in EKGs , negative MIBI , and an Echo with
globaly reduced EF , we choose to medicaly treat her. she will be
evaluated in the future for AICD/CRT , then a cath can also be considered.
She will follow up with Dr. Rafael Abeita .

Discharge Date: 5/12/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 78-year-old gentleman
who is admitted for aortic valve
replacement on August , 2002. He has has asymptomatic aortic
stenosis. He also has known coronary artery disease having
undergone angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary
artery in 1991. Catheterization at that time demonstrated an 80%
left anterior descending lesion and a 60% first diagonal lesion.
He has had a 4-5 year history of shortness of breath diagnosed with
mild aortic stenosis and followed clinically. In the planning
process for knee surgery , serial echocardiograms were performed
showing decreased aortic valve area and decreasing ejection
fraction. Most recent echocardiogram shows moderate to severe
aortic stenosis and has been suggested to have the valve replaced
before undergoing knee surgery. The patient was admitted for
elective aortic valve replacement prior to knee surgery. He has a
history of class II heart failure , slight limitation of physical
activity. He is in normal sinus rhythm.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , degenerative
joint disease of the bilateral knees , left greater than right ,
status post left total knee replacement in 1994 with persistent
symptoms to undergo surgery for his knee , benign prostatic
hypertrophy , decreasing hearing , left greater than right.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: A total knee replacement in 1994 ,
appendectomy in the 1960s.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Diltiazem ER 180 mg once a day , Isordil
30 mg three times a day , enteric coated
aspirin 325 mg once a day , Zocor 10 mg once a day , Cozaar 25 mg
once a day , Humulin N 30 units in the morning and 14 units in the
evening.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Heart rate 80 and regular.
HEENT: Dentition is without evidence of
infection. NECK: No carotid bruits were heard. CHEST: Clear.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. He has a systolic ejection murmur
at 3/6 in the aortic area radiating to the carotids. ABDOMEN:
Soft and non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Left total knee replacement
incision , no varicose veins. NEUROLOGICAL: Intact.
LABORATORY: Laboratory studies on admission include a BUN of 13 ,
creatinine 1.3 , white blood cell count 6.0 , hematocrit
40.7. His echocardiogram performed on June , 2001 demonstrated
an TPP Hospital65% , aortic stenosis with a mean gradient
of 42 mm Hg , peak gradient of 63 mm Hg , calculated valve area of
0.9 cm squared with mild mitral insufficiency , trivial
insufficiency and a mildly dilated left atrium. EKG shows normal
sinus rhythm at 88. Chest x-ray is clear.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent coronary arteriography on
August , 2002 at Wi Wirolllen Hospital .
This examination showed a right dominant system with a diffuse 40%
lesion of the left main , discrete 50% lesion of his proximal left
anterior descending coronary artery , a 70% lesion of his mid left
anterior descending artery with an 80% distal lesion. He also had
an 80% lesion of his first diagonal and a diffuse 50% proximal
lesion of the same vessel , 70% ostial lesion of his circumflex and
an eccentric 45% lesion of his right coronary artery with a 70%
lesion in his large left ventricular branch. The patient went to
the operating room on August , 2002 where he underwent an aortic
valve replacement with a #23 Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve
and a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery ,
saphenous vein graft to the first marginal and saphenous vein graft
to the posterior left ventricular branch. His intraoperative
course was uneventful. He was seen in consultation by the Diabetic
Management Service for blood sugar control and initiation into the
Portland Protocol for intravenous insulin. His postoperative
course was complicated by an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation
which was treated with replacement of his electrolytes and
initiation of Lopressor therapy and also mild anemia that was
monitored and addressed with diuresis for fluid overload. His
postoperative course was uneventful. He continued to require
diuresis for pleural effusion. Chest x-ray on discharge
demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions. His hematocrit on
discharge is 25.6. At this point in time , there is no need to
transfuse the patient. He is stable. Heart rate is stable. He is
on room air oxygenating at 97%. He is to be discharged to
rehabilitation on the following medications.

PROCEDURES: 9/25/2007 , therapeutic paracentesis , 4 liters of
ascitic fluid removed without complication. Chemistries and cell
counts of ascitic fluid as described above in the laboratory
section.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 63-year-old man with history of
end-stage renal disease - on hemodialysis , coronary artery
disease , diabetes , severe peripheral vascular disease status post
bilateral knee amputations , who presented with two months of
worsening ascites of unclear etiology. His hospital course by
problem is as follows:
1. Gastrointestinal: The patient underwent a therapeutic
paracentesis with ascites fluid revealing chemistries with total
protein greater than 2.5 and serum ascites albumin gradient
greater than 1.1 consistent with a transudative ascites , likely
due to volume overload with resultant right heart failure.
Ascites had 460 white blood cells with 20% polys. Therefore , it
was not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Ascitic fluids were negative for growth of bacteria and cytology
of the ascitic fluids identified no malignant cells. After
consultation with the cardiology service , it was concluded that
the ascites was due to massive volume overload , and therefore the
patient should undergo reduction of volume through
ultrafiltration at dialysis. This process was begun as an
inpatient by the renal service. While the patient was an
inpatient , efforts to remove fluid was complicated by
development of hypotension during dialysis as
well as by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
with heart rates up to the 140s. Due to the difficulties with
removing fluid at dialysis , the patient was offered the option of
undergoing ultrafiltration by CVVH or an ultrafiltration machine ,
but the patient and the family declined to participate in such
care. It should also be noted that despite our efforts , the
patient was not compliant with fluid restrictions that were put
into place in the patient's diet order , therefore also making it
difficult to treat the patient's volume overload. The patient
was discharged with the plan to continue ultrafiltration at outpatient
dialysis in an attempt to continue to remove fluid and reduce the
patient's volume overload. This plan was communicated by the
attending renal , Dr. Simon Esbrandt , to the patient's outpatient renal
attending , Dr. Archie Chhum .
2. Renal: As described above , the patient has end-stage renal
disease - on hemodialysis. As described above , ultrafiltration
was attempted at hemodialysis to remove as much fluid as possible
and to reduce the patient's volume overloaded state.
Ultrafiltration should be continued as an outpatient to continue
to attempt to counteract the patient's volume overload.
3. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , the patient has a history of
coronary artery disease status post CABG and stent , but his usual
aspirin and Plavix were initially held given that surgical
revision of his right below-the-knee amputation had been planned.
However , after discussion with the patient's vascular surgeon ,
Dr. Herb Piecuch , it was decided that the patient's volume
overload should be corrected prior to his undergoing surgical
revision of his right leg. Therefore , aspirin and Plavix were
restarted on 11/16/2007 .  Pump: The patient has evidence of
right heart failure by echocardiogram. On physical exam and as
described above , this is likely a consequence of the patient's
volume overload. Again , as described above , volume was removed
through ultrafiltration at dialysis. Rhythm: The patient has a
history of atrial fibrillation but is not anticoagulated , likely
for fear of noncompliance. The patient was in normal sinus
rhythm for the majority of this admission but on 1/8/2007 , the
patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular with
rates to the 120s to 140s. However , the patient refused to
accept monitoring on cardiac telemetry and also refused to
cooperate with the administration of intravenous medications for
heart rate control. Therefore , the patient's dose of oral
Lopressor was slowly titrated upward as tolerated by his blood
pressures , but on discharge his rate remained in the low 100s and
were not optimally controlled. However , the patient refused
further management of his atrial fibrillation , and it was
therefore decided that this should be managed as an outpatient
with continued slow readjustment of his oral beta-blocker
regimen.
4. Endocrine: The patient was continued on his home insulin
regimen and fingersticks were monitored on a q.a.c. and nightly
basis with adequate control of blood sugars.
5. Vascular: As described above , the patient has a right
below-the-knee amputation , which need surgical revision. As
described above , after discussion with the patient's vascular
surgeon , Dr. Mel Bierut , it was decided that the patient's
surgical revision of his right leg would be addressed after his
issues with volume overload are resolved.
6. Infectious disease: It was noted that the patient has as a
likely paronychia of his left index finger. Plain films were
obtained , which did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. A
hand surgery consult was obtained , and it was noted that there
were no vascular issues with his left hand and that no urgent
surgical debridement of the left finger was necessary. The
patient was treated with oral levofloxacin and will continue
taking levofloxacin for a total of 3-week course to end on
6/11/2007 .  Oxycodone was administered for pain control of his
left finger as well as for pain control of his right leg.
Prophylaxis , the patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin for
DVT prophylaxis and placed on Nexium for GI prophylaxis.
The patient was full code during this admission.
PHYSICIAN FOLLOWUP PLANS: The patient has a followup appointment
with his vascular surgeon , Dr. Huey Lamond , on 10/26/2007 at
2:30 p.m. , phone number 178-843-9703. The patient should call
his doctor his primary care physician , Dr. Jamal Gehlert ,
telephone #204-180-5657 , for appointment in two to three weeks.
The patient will continue dialysis at Gentville under the
direction of Dr. Alphonso Berwald on a Monday , Wednesday , Friday
schedule. This patient should complete a total of 14-day course
of levofloxacin to end on 6/11/2007 for his left fourth finger
paronychia/skin infection. The patient's beta-blocker should be
titrated upwards as tolerated by blood pressure for better
control of his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. As described
above , ultrafiltration should be used during dialysis to remove
total body volume.

PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Pneumonia.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. COPD.
2. Arrhythmia.
3. AVNRT/SVT.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
On admission was shortness of breath and fever.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 73-year-old male with COPD , hypertension , chronic renal
insufficiency , CHF , with ejection fraction of 60% , pulmonary
hypertension , and arrhythmias who was discharged on 5/10/05 but
returned later in the evening complaining of worsening shortness
of breath and fevers at home. On prior hospitalization , the
patient had presented on 10/10/05 with acute shortness of breath
and hypertension with chest pain and was ruled out for MI and PE.
In addition , he was treated for minor COPD exacerbation with
steroids and nebulizer but not antibiotics and was discharged on
5/10/05 at baseline home O2 of 2 liters and was afebrile. At
presentation on 9/30/05 , the patient noted worsening shortness
of breath with increasing oxygen needs and in the ED was found to
have a temperature of 102.4. On chest x-ray , the patient was
found to have left lower lobe pneumonia that had not been noted
on chest x-ray from 10/10/05 and on the PECT on 4/19/05 .  The
patient was admitted on 9/30/05 for pneumonia and increasing
oxygen requirements.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Past medical history is notable for a. fib with SVT not on
Coumadin , hypertension , COPD with home oxygen at 2 liters ,
hyperlipidemia , gout , coronary vascular disease , chronic renal
insufficiency , and type II diabetes controlled on diet.
MEDICATIONS:
His medications at time of admission included aspirin 81 mg
daily , allopurinol 100 mg daily , Lopressor 50 mg t.i.d. , the
patient was on the prednisone taper , Hytrin 2 mg daily , Zocor 40
mg q.h.s. , Flovent , Prilosec , and Atrovent.
ALLERGIES:
He has allergies to sulfa , lisinopril , and quinine causing
platelet deficiency.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient had quit cigarette and denied any alcohol or illicit
drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Physical exam at the time of admission was notable for a
temperature of 101 , blood pressure 95/53 , oxygen saturation of
86% on 2 liters , pulse of 96 , and respiratory rate of 24. The
patient was noted to have crackles with left side being greater
than right. His cardiovascular exam had normal S1 , S2 regular
rate and rhythm with no rubs , murmurs or gallops. His
extremities were notable for trace edema. Neurologically , he was
intact.
LABORATORY DATA:
His labs at time of admission was notable for a creatinine of
1.7 , and a white cell count of 16 , he had a ABG with pH of 7.42 ,
PaCO2 of 35 , PaO2 of 52 , and 89% oxygen saturation on 2 liters.
His EKG showed T wave inversions in V2-V3 , flat V4 , borderline
first-degree AV block in sinus rhythm. Chest x-ray was notable
for left lower lobe pneumonia.
ASSESSMENT:
On assessment , this is a 73-year-old gentleman recently
discharged for minor COPD flare , presenting with acute hypoxemia
likely secondary to left lower lobe pneumonia with COPD.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Pulmonary:
a. Hypoxia: The patient presented with acute and chronic
hypoxia. The patient initially required short term MICU stay for
a BiPAP and was gradually weaned to facemask over 24 hours. On
day two of admission , he was weaned to 8 liters and was
transferred to the floor where his respiratory management was
continued. On 10/4/05 , day 3 of hospitalization , the patient
had been weaned to 5 liters when he began coughing and abruptly
desaturated to 70% oxygen saturation with complaints of shortness
of breath and chest pain and required nonrebreather. The patient
had no EKG changes and a chest x-ray was unchanged from prior on
9/30/05 .  The patient was given DuoNeb and chest PT. He was
stabilized and was able to be managed on the floor and
transitioned back to 8 liters. At time of discharge , he has been
weaned to 4 liters with 91-97% oxygen saturation. The patient
does continue to desaturate with activities and requires further
pulmonary rehabilitation including chest PT to remove mucus
plugging noted on CT PE from earlier hospitalization in April .
b. Pneumonia: The patient presented with left lower lobe
pneumonia. He was started on vancomycin , ceftriaxone , and
azithromycin on 9/30/05 .  He had a sputum culture positive for
MRSA and was therefore continued on vancomycin. He was briefly
transitioned to vancomycin with ceftazidime and Flagyl from
8/14/05 to 08 , but was switched back to vancomycin with
cefotaxime and azithromycin on 5/26/05 .  On day of discharge , he
will be leaving on vancomycin to complete two more days of
treatment for a total 10-day course. In addition , he will be
discharged on Levaquin for an additional seven-day course of
treatment for his pneumonia.
c. COPD: The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation and was
most recently discharged on 5/10/05 for mild COPD exacerbation
treated with DuoNeb and steroid taper. During this hospital
course , the patient continued on DuoNeb treatments as well as a
steroid taper. Given his acute clinical course in this
hospitalization , the patient did not have pulmonary function test
performed but with benefit from PFT studies as an outpatient. At
time of discharge , the patient is on 4 liters of oxygen and is
currently on prednisone 5 mg which will be tapered to his home
regimen of prednisone 5 mg every other day.
d. Hypertension: The patient had been noted to have a pulmonary
artery pressure in 2003 in the 60s but on this admission had an
echo at time of admission that noted that his pulmonary artery
pressure was now at 98 mmHg. The patient was followed by the
Insmotho Erout Hospital Service to assess his pulmonary hypertension.
The patient will be followed as an outpatient by the
Malv Medical Center Service and will likely need right heart
catheterization to assess his right heart function as well as his
pulmonary hypertension.
2. Cardiovascular:
a. Pump: The patient has congestive heart failure with
diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction around 60% as
noted on an echo done on 9/30/05 .  The patient initially had his
Lasix held due to his creatinine of 1.7 at time of admission.
However , given his acute respiratory status , as well as his
increasing edema during his hospital course , the patient was
again aggressively diuresed for his CHF exacerbation with Lasix.
At time of discharge , the patient still has trace edema and his
creatinine has remained at his baseline of 1.1-1.2. The patient
will be discharged on his home Lasix regimen of 40 mg p.o.
although he required IV Lasix on multiple occasions during his
hospital course.
b. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension.
Overall , his systolic blood pressure remained in the range from
110-130s. The patient was on Lopressor during his hospital
course and had no acute issues regarding his hypertension.
c. Ischemia: The patient had been ruled out for MI with three
sets of negative cardiac biomarkers. He was continued on
telemetry and remained on a regimen of aspirin , beta blockers , as
well as statin during this hospital course.
d. Rate: The patient has a history of arrhythmias with
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and SVTs. At last admission on
10/10/05 , the patient presented to the ED in SVT and hypotensive
and reverted back to normal sinus rhythm after one dose of IV
Lopressor. The patient was continued on Lopressor 50 mg t.i.d.
during his hospital course with his DuoNeb treatments. The
patient did occasionally have heart rate into the 140s consistent
with AV nodal reentry tachycardia. These incidences did not last
more than 2 minutes and the patient was in general asymptomatic
from these arrhythmias although did occasionally did complain of
some shortness of breath on occasion during these periods of
arrhythmia. The patient is being continued on Lopressor 50 mg
t.i.d.
3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of type II diabetes
that was under diet control as an outpatient with steroid
treatment for his COPD exacerbation. The patient did have his
blood glucose measured regularly three times a day and required a
regular insulin sliding scale for his steroid-induced diabetes.
With tapering of the steroids , the patient's blood glucose has
generally ranged between 100-150 and has required less insulin.
While the patient is on steroids , we will continue to monitor his
blood glucose level and cover with insulin as needed. The
patient will follow up with his primary care physician and
discuss further his overall need for oral hypoglycemic agents.
4. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency with baseline creatinine around 1.1-1.2. At
initial time of presentation , his creatinine was 1.7 and his
Lasix had been held. However , the patient developed lower
extremity edema with shortness of breath and required Lasix for
his CHF exacerbation. His creatinine was followed closely during
his hospital course and with Lasix diureses his creatinine did
rise slowly to 1.4 , however , the benefits of diureses for CHF
exacerbation outweighed his chronic renal insufficiency state.
We would recommend that the patient follow up with his primary
care physician to monitor his renal state.
5. FEN: During this hospital course , the patient's electrolytes
were monitored and repleted as needed. He had no acute issues
regarding his electrolytes or nutritional status. However , the
patient should continue on low-salt 2 g sodium diet as well as
limit his fluid intake to 1.5 liters per day.
6. ID: The patient , at initial time of admission , had a
temperature of 101.2 with white cell count as high as 16. He was
found on chest x-ray to have a left lower lobe pneumonia and was
started on a antibiotic course as dictated above in pulmonary.
The patient remained afebrile through the extent of this hospital
course while on the antibiotic therapy his sputum cultures were
positive for MRSA. At time of discharge , he will be continued on
his antibiotics on vancomycin for an additional two days for a
total of 10-day course and he will also be started on Levaquin
for a seven-day course. At time of discharge , the patient
remained afebrile with his white cell count of 12.6. The patient
is on prednisone , which can slightly his overall white cell
count. The patient is aware that if he had worsening of his
sputum production as well as fevers , to seek medical attention.
7. Heme: The patient had no active issues.
8. GI: The patient had regular bowel movements during his
hospital course and deferred bowel regimen. He was on proton
pump inhibitor for prophylaxis and would be continued on this as
an outpatient.
PROPHYLAXIS:
The patient received heparin 5000 units subcutaneous t.i.d.
CODE STATUS:
The patient is full code.
DISPOSITION:
The patient will be discharged to rehab for further management of
his pneumonia as well as for pulmonary rehabilitation with
physical therapy.

history of non ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy thought to be either familial or secondary to
alcohol use who is on the transplant list and presents with
worsening CHF symptoms.
Ms. Ohlenbusch cardiac history began in 1995 when she was admitted
with worsening dyspnea. Echocardiogram at that time revealed an
ejection fraction of 15% with global hypokinesis and 3+ mitral
regurgitation. Catheterization revealed a right dominant system
with clean coronary arteries. Exercise test at that time revealed
a peak VO2 of 12.6 liters per kg per minute. IN October of 1997 , a
repeat echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% with
moderate mitral regurgitation and significant left atrial
dilatation. At that time , she received tailored therapy with
Digoxin , diuretics and ACE inhibitors. In February of 1997 , she
was again hospitalized , this time with severe pancreatitis
resulting in acute renal failure , hypotension and respiratory
failure requiring intubation in the ICU. In April of 1997 , she
developed progressive dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and PND. In
October of 1998 , repeat echocardiogram revealed severe left
ventricular dilatation with an EF of 10 to 15% , global hypokinesis
and left atrial dilatation secondary to mitral regurgitation. She
was hospitalized most recently in August 1999 for abdominal
discomfort thought to be secondary to worsening right heart failure
and improved with aggressive diuresis.
She has done well since then until approximately three weeks prior
to admission when she developed worsening dyspnea and intermittent
tachycardia. She reports four pillow orthopnea and three nights of
PND. She becomes short of breath walking up only five stairs , and
reports approximately three weeks of a dry cough , productive
occasionally of clear sputum. She denies fever , chills , nausea ,
vomiting or diarrhea , GI , or GU symptoms.

Discharge Date: 10/11/2006
ATTENDING: KELLIHER , ASHLEY MD
SERVICE: General Medicine Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Altered mental status.
LIST OF PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: Altered mental status , metastatic
adenocarcinoma , diabetes type 2 , history of sarcoid by report ,
status post cholecystectomy , status post laminectomy of T9
through T12.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Malloch is a 51-year-old
woman with a history of metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown
primary origin who presents as a transfer initially from Ons Hospital with altered mental status. The patient was initially
diagnosed with cancer and presenting with lower back pain in
5/15 when she was found to have lytic spinal and pelvic
lesions on MRI. Immunohistochemistry was most consistent with
pancreatic cancer origin. She was admitted to the Laso in early October for cord compression and
underwent XRT and laminectomy by orthopedic surgeon by Dr.
Kasey Mahaxay . During that admission , she was also noted to have
a large pericardial effusion and underwent pericardial window.
She was then discharged from Madei Coxcli Hospital on
7/20/06 to rehab. At rehab , the patient was noted to have
difficulties expressing herself and word finding at 01:00 a.m. on
the day of admission. Prior to this episode , she had normal
speech and mental status and it is pertinent to note that on the
day prior to admisison she had been seen in Oncology Clinic with
Dr. Randell Youkhana and hence was started on Zometa. The patient
denies any fevers , chills , neck stiffness or focal neurologic
symptoms. She was initially sent to Inh Hospital And Medical Center where a
noncontrast CT scan was done and found to be negative for an
acute process and was then admitted to General Service. At that
point , it had been over three hours since symptom onset and her
cancer further precluded any possible TPA therapy. An MRI was
then attempted to be obtained , however , the patient required
intravenous conscious sedation to attempt the MRI secondary to
agitation and anxiety. The patient received total of 2 mg of
Versed , 4.5 mg of IV Ativan and 2 mg of oral Ativan and several
attempts were made to facilitate the MRI. She was unable to sit
for MRI and was able to sit for a head CT with angiography. As
she became more and more somnolent , it was felt that additional
sedation might necessitate intubation. The Anesthesia Service
called and pointed out that the Mas MRI machine is
not compatible with intubated patients. The patient was then
transferred to Down Camp for possible MRI with
intubation. An LP at this time was also unable to be performed
secondary to her restlessness.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Metastatic adenocarcinoma , diabetes
mellitus type 2 , history of sarcoid ( although never had a
biopsy ) , status post cholecystectomy , status post laminectomy of
T9 , T11 and T12.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Lorazepam 0.5 mg q.3 h. p.r.n.
agitation , omeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily , senna two tabs p.o.
b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation , metoprolol SR 50 mg p.o. daily ,
ondansetron 8 mg p.o. b.i.d. , furosemide 20 mg p.o. daily ,
insulin sliding scale , insulin Humalog 6 units a.c. , insulin NPH
10 units b.i.d. , enoxaparin 40 mg daily subcutaneous , docusate
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation , Tylenol 650 mg q.6 h.
p.r.n. pain.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin with an unknown reaction.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature of 98 degrees , heart rate
81 , blood pressure 107/51 , respirations 20 , sating 97% on 2 L.
General exam showed a drowsy-feeling patient who was oriented x1
( not for place or time ). HEENT exam shows pupils equal , round
and reactive with no photophobia. Neck exam showed a supple neck
with no lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary exam showed lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam showed a JVP that
was difficult to assess , heart rate showed a regular rate and
rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops , distal pulses were bilateral
and 2+ and symmetric. Abdominal exam showed an obese abdomen , is
nontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities exam showed extremities warm and well perfused.
Neurologic exam showed the patient was alert and oriented only x1
with 2+ patellar reflexes , 2+ ankle reflexes and 1+ brachial
reflexes. The patient was poorly responsive to questions and
commands , hence a motor and sensory exam was unable to be
obtained , however , the patient was moving all extremities.
PERTINENT LABS ON ADMISSION: Included a negative tox screen ,
otherwise unremarkable. EKG showed sinus tach to 103 beats per
minute , slightly low voltage. Chest x-ray showed cardiac
enlargement without acute or active disease. Head CT showed no
acute intracranial abnormality noted. Urinalysis showed trace
leuk esterase , 5 to 10 white blood cells , 200 rbc's , however ,
urine culture showed no growth.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Neurologic: The patient was initially admitted to the
medical ICU for possible MRI with intubation. However , upon
arrival , the patient was alert and oriented enough to refuse the
MRI/MRA ( this was desired to rule out metastatic disease versus
leptomeningeal disease ). Because she did not require she was
then sent to the floor on 2/11/06 .  A full toxic metabolic
workup was obtained , which showed the ammonia levels within
normal limits and nonreactive RPR , B12 assay that was actually
slightly elevated and a TSH level of 10.6 ( a full thyroid panel
was also sent , which was pending at the time of discharge and
should be followed ). Given the concern for her slight pyuria on
her UA and her altered mental status she was also given a
three-day course of ciprofloxacin , however , her urinary culture
was negative. She presently , within the first 24 hours of her
stay on the floor , her mental status improved remarkably and was
at her baseline. Hence , an MRI/MRA was not performed , as this
would require the patient to undergo further sedation ( it was
felt that her significant amount of benzodiazepines that were
given previously only served to worsen her mental status ). An LP
was not indicated at this time since she had returned to her
baseline. An echo was ordered but was not performed secondary to
the fact that the patient had had a previous echo within the last
month , but was desired to rule the very small chance that she had
marantic endocarditis with embolic phenomenon. At the time of
discharge , the patient was at her neurologic baseline and was
alert and oriented x4. The likely source of her altered mental
status appears to be toxic metabolic multifactorial etiology ,
including the possibility of Zometa effect , the urinary tract
infection and possible hypothyroidism.
2. Onc: The patient has an appointment with Dr. Garrett Gavidia of
Shiresy Medical Center Oncology on 2/10/06 to initiate Gemzar
chemotherapy.
3. Ortho: The patient has a followup appointment with Dr. Maron
of Spi Medical Center Orthopedics on 8/9/06 for
further followup.
4. Endocrine: The patient will be discharged to rehab on a
regimen of Lantus and sliding scale insulin. She should have her
TFTs followed up as they are pending at this time for possible
initiation of hormone replacement.
5. ID: The patient finished a three-day course of ciprofloxacin
for possible urinary tract infection , however , her urinary
culture was negative.
6. Cardiovascular: The patient was initially transferred on
metoprolol , however , her blood pressures have been well
controlled in-house. If her blood pressures are elevated at
rehab , one could consider restarting her metoprolol.
7. Disposition: The patient was in stable condition and
discharged back to rehab for further care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: Temperature of 98.6 , blood
pressure of 110/60 , heart rate 98 , respirations 18 , sating 99% on
room air. General exam shows a slightly obese female who is
alert and oriented x4 in no acute distress. Cardiovascular exam
shows a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
Neck shows a supple neck with no JVD. Pulmonary exam shows
lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal exam shows a
slightly obese abdomen that is nondistended and nontender with
good bowel sounds. Skin exam shows a midline back scar that is
healing well and nontender with no erythema. Extremity exam
shows no calf tenderness with trace edema.
MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE: Tessalon Perles 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
p.r.n. cough , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , guaifenesin 10 mL p.o.
q.6 h. p.r.n. cough , Lantus 20 units subcu q.p.m. , Insulin
Regular sliding scale q.a.c. and at bedtime , Zydis 5 mg p.o.

10 mg p.o. q.6 h. p.r.n. pain , Lovenox 40 mg subcu daily.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to rehab for further
care in stable condition.
PENDING TESTS: The patient's thyroid function test should be
followed up.

ATTENDING: WEDD , ELLIOT MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Diabetes management and teaching.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Diabetes management and teaching.
ID/CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Ms. In is a 32-year-old G6P2-0-3-2 at 22-6/7 weeks' gestational
age admitted for blood sugar control after first prenatal visit
in Special OB Clinic. Her dating is by her last menstrual
period , which was 9/26/05 , giving her an estimated date of
confinement of 2/27/05 .  An ultrasound at 14 weeks done during
an ER admission for vaginal bleeding confirmed her gestational
age. Prenatal screen were not known at the time of admission.
HISTORY OF PRESENT PREGNANCY:
Ms. Horka had been scheduled to see a midwife at Do 1 but
had been unable to keep appointment. Her pregnancy thus far has
been notable for:
1. Late prenatal care.
2. Hypertension. She has had blood pressures that were
140's/90's several months prior to pregnancy. Her blood pressure
in clinic on the day of admission was 139/79.
3. Diabetes , likely type 2 , class B diabetic. Predates
pregnancy , per the patient her blood sugars prior to pregnancy
ranged from the 120-180 range and that she reports she has never
needed to take insulin. She had a visit at Til Dr. , Burg A Rill and was
given a glucometer and known fasting sugars ranged from the
90s-140s and one hour postprandials ranged from 140-230.
4. She is a smoker.
5. History of depression. She currently takes Remeron and is
followed by her outpatient psychiatrist with whom she has had a
longstanding relationship. Given that the Remeron was a class C
medication , she was discontinued on that.
HER PAST OB HISTORY:
She had three prior first trimester TABs and two priors
spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Her largest baby was 7 pounds 12
ounces.
GYN HISTORY:
She has a history of high-grade SIL , status post colpo with
biopsies. Her last Pap was a year ago and within normal limits.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Also , notable for a history of renal stones and migraine
headaches.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
She had laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS:
Her only medication is Remeron.
ALLERGIES:
She has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She smokes approximately seven cigarettes daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Her blood pressure is 139/79. She is well appearing. Her heart
was regular rate and rhythm. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen was soft and obese. It is
difficult to assess fundal height. Pelvic exam had normal
mucosa , normal cervix. Bimanual exam revealed approximately 22
weeks size uterus with audible fetal heart tones.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Diabetes: Given the late time in the day of her appointment
and the inability to establish proper diabetic teaching as an
outpatient , she was admitted for diabetic teaching and control.
She had never previously used medications and has had reportedly
poor control with diet. Risks of diabetes were discussed. She
was started on a regimen of 14 of N q.a.m. and 14 of N at bedtime
with 6 of Humalog premeal as per Dr. Haggett . Her sugars overnight
while in-house were as follows: 100 fasting , 175 approximately
two hours postprandial , 157 and then a fasting of 94 this is
while receiving that stated insulin regimen. She was seen by the
Diabetes Management Service and Dr. Saunders on 5/10/05 who
recommended increasing her prebreakfast and predinner Humalog to
8. She will need an Ophthalmology consult as an outpatient.
Hemoglobin A1c was sent and was 5.3.
2. Hypertension: Given her elevated blood pressure of 139/79 in
clinic and her history that was notable for potentially a
longstanding hypertension , her blood pressure was monitored
closely and baseline preeclampsia labs were sent. Her blood
pressure overnight was within normal limits with values this
morning of 108/60 seated and 90/50 lying. She had a normal BUN ,
creatinine , ALT , AST , and uric acid. A 24-hour urine protein was
completed during this hospitalization and the results are pending
at the time of this dictation.
3. History of depression: Her Remeron was discontinued and I
discussed her symptoms of depression with her in greater detail.
She said that she primarily uses Remeron as a sleep aid and the
major side effect she experiences with withdrawal of Remeron is
nightmares. She does not feel as if she has a problem with
depression and declined a psychiatry consultation while in the
hospital. She has an outpatient psychiatrist whom she has a
longstanding relationship with. I advised to discuss her
pregnancy with her psychiatrist and to be in contact should she
have any concerns. She reported that she always knows if she
needs additional help and will be in contact with her doctor.
4. Fetal well-being: Baseline and prenatal laboratories were
sent on 4/19/05 .  Her blood type is B positive. Her antibody
screen was negative. Her RPR was nonreactive. Her hepatitis B
surface antigen is negative , rubella immune , gonorrhea and
chlamydia are negative. She had an ultrasound done on the
5/10/05 which revealed a singleton intrauterine gestation. Her
placenta was posterior and not previa. She had normal Dopplers
and normal fetal survey. The fetal risks of uncontrolled
diabetes were discussed and she expressed that she understood all
of these concerns.
5. Cardiac. A baseline EKG was obtained which revealed normal
sinus rhythm , normal axis , normal rate , however , her QT-interval
was slightly prolonged at 491 msec. The upper limit of normal in
women is 460. I briefly discussed this finding with the Medicine
Consult Service and Cardiology Service who felt that this is
likely attributable to her low potassium of 3.2. Therefore , high
content potassium foods were encouraged and she will have a
repeat EKG at her prenatal visit next week to evaluate for
resolution of this prolonged QT. Of note , she reports that her
mother had a congenital heart condition and experienced her first
heart attack at the age of 27 due to what she thought was an
enlarged heart. Her mother ultimately died at the age of 56 from
a heart attack. She reports aside from her mom who she does feel
had this condition since birth; no one in her family has
experienced sudden cardiac death. She also has never experienced
palpitations or chest pain.
6. History of kidney stones. A urinalysis was sent which
revealed 1-5 red blood cells and the urine culture showed 10 , 000
of mixed flora.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
Given Ms. Bruechert strong desire to be discharged after only a day
of admission , she was discharged to home with the following
instructions:
She is to take her fingerstick blood sugars fasting and at one
hour postprandial intervals and record them prior to her
follow-up appointment. She is also instructed to eat foods high
in potassium and to call the office in an urgent manner should
she develop chest pain or palpitations. She has appointments
scheduled for 6/6/04 with Dr. Gettys in special OB Clinic ,
Dr. Weisse in Endocrine Clinic and Nutrition. She was given
prescriptions for NPH to take 14 units subcu a.m. and 14 units
subcu at bedtime and Humalog 8 units prebreakfast , 6 units
prelunch , and 8 units predinner. She is also advised to take
prenatal vitamins one tablet p.o. daily. She understands all
these follow up plans and has no concerns with her discharge at
this time.

ATTENDING: KAPPLER , TRINIDAD MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 70-year-old woman with a
history of an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction
of 35% and also a history of coronary artery disease status post
MI , insulin-dependent diabetes , peripheral vascular disease and
chronic renal insufficiency who presented with volume overloaded.
The patient was recently discharged after a 9-day admission from
6/10/2006 to 05 for a CHF exacerbation. During the
previous admission , she had been diuresed with a Lasix drip and
then started on amiodarone and Coumadin for a new paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. After discharge , she presented to NSCHC
Cardiology Clinic on 1/16/2006 with a jugular venous pressure at
15 cm and severe bilateral lower extremity edema and a BNP of
2500. The assessment in clinic was that she had been under
diuresed in the previous admission and therefore she was directly
admitted to Poredtiesbarre General Hospital for reinitiation of aggressive
diuresis. Of note , the patient had recently changed from Lasix
to torsemide after the last discharge as her outpatient
medication. She endorsed worsened orthopnea , dyspnea on
exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as well as early satiety.
She denied any chest pain or other anginal equivalents.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30%-35%.
2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , newly on Coumadin and
amiodarone.
3. Coronary artery disease status post MI.

ALLERGIES: Lisinopril and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives at home with
her husband. She quit tobacco with rare alcohol use and no
drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. There is no family history of
cardiac disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature was 98.9 , heart
rate 70 , blood pressure 104/50 , respiratory rate of 20 , oxygen
saturation 95% on room air. In general , the patient was
comfortable in no acute distress. HEENT , Pupils were equal ,
round , and reactive. Oropharynx was clear. The JVP was greater
than 15 cm , chest exam showed bilateral crackles at the bases
with bibasilar dullness well as well as right greater than left
base. Cardiovascular was regular rate and rhythm with a S3 and
no murmur. Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended with a
nonpulsatile liver. Extremities showed 3+ pitting edema
bilaterally to the hips with bilateral changes of arterial and
venous insufficiency. Laboratory studies were significant for an
INR of 1.6 , BUN of 110 , creatinine 3 , white blood cell count of
11.7 and a hematocrit of 27.9.
EKG on admission was a normal sinus rhythm with evidence of a
previous anterior MI with lateral repolarization , ST and T wave
abnormalities , and possible LVH.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions , left greater than right
with increased vascular markings and fluid in the right fissure ,
but no discrete infiltrates.
IMPRESSION: This is a 70-year-old woman with ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 35% , coronary artery disease status
post MI , insulin-dependent diabetes , peripheral vascular disease ,
chronic renal insufficiency who presented in volume overload
after a recent admission with insufficient diuresis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular. In terms of pump , the patient was clearly in
gross volume overload from both the right sided and left-sided
failure on presentation. Her blood pressure was stable and she
had no evidence of severely decreased cardiac output or/and organ
perfusion. She was started on the Lasix drip at 10 mg per hour
and Zaroxolyn at 2.5 mg p.o. daily. Her Lopressor was held for a
decompensated heart failure. She initially diuresed well
overnight; however , on the second day her diuresis tapered off
and her Lasix drip was turned up to 20 mg per hour and the
Zaroxolyn was increased to b.i.d. She met her I&O goal of
greater than 1 liter negative overnight the following night ,
however , a day later , she again had poor diuresis and the
Zaroxolyn was changed to Diuril. At this time , a repeat chest
x-ray showed a very little change in her bilateral pleural
effusions , so her diuresis up to this point was felt to be
insufficient. After the transition from Zaroxolyn to Diuril ,
which was given 250 mg IV b.i.d. , she was noted to have an
increase in creatinine from 2.9. gradually up to 3.2; however ,
remained stable for the next few days and the patient was able to
maintain good diuresis on this regimen without bump in her
creatinine.
On 4/25/2006 , she was noted to have greatly improved lower
extremity edema and that improved lung exam and she had met her
goal weight of less than 85 kilograms. Lasix drip was
discontinued in the afternoon on 4/25/2006 and she was restarted
on her home p.o. torsemide regimen of 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 50
mg p.o. q.p.m. for anticipated discharge home on 8/13/2006 .  The
Diuril was also discontinued. The patient was anticipated to be
stable on b.i.d. torsemide and p.o. on metolazone at home. Her
new dry weight on this admission was established at 85 kilograms
and this should be at a goal for diuresis should she require
admission in the future.
She will follow up with her CSH cardiologist for further
monitoring of her volume status after discharge. In terms of
rhythm , the patient had a new presentation of atrial fibrillation
on the prior admission and was started on amiodarone and Coumadin
at that time. She was in normal sinus rhythm on presentation at
this admission and remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the
admission and was monitored on telemetry with no other events.
She was continued on her home dose of amiodarone and continued on
Coumadin; however despite the dose being decreased from her home
dose of 1 mg q.p.m. to a 0.5 mg q.p.m. , her INR continued to rise
and was eventually 3.5. Her Coumadin was discontinued. She was
recommended to be discharged off Coumadin and follow up with her
primary care provider during the week following discharge to
recheck her INR and restart her Coumadin when it falls below 2.5.
In terms of ischemia , the patient had no acute evidence of
ischemia on presentation. Denied any chest pain and had no
changes consistent with ischemia on her EKG. She was continued
on aspirin and Lipitor throughout the admission.
2. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency at
baseline. Her creatinine did increase from a baseline of 2.9 to
3.2. During this admission , however , remained stable after that
point. She continued on renally-dosed medications and actually
required repletion of both potassium and magnesium despite her
renal insufficiency throughout the admission in the setting of
aggressive diuresis. Her electrolytes were stable prior to
discharge home. She was followed by the LCH Renal Clinic with
whom she has had a previous conversations about the possibility
of hemodialysis in the future and she will see them shortly after
this discharge:
3. Pulmonary: The patient had dyspnea on exertion and bilateral
pleural effusions on her chest x-ray on admission. This was all
felt to be consistent with her heart failure. She did have no
signs or symptoms of any infectious etiology either on imaging or
as a part of her clinical picture. Her dyspnea on exertion and
her lung exam both improved with her aggressive diuresis.
4. Endocrine: The patient had erratic fingersticks early in the
admission with a very low fingerstick blood glucoses in the
morning initially , so her p.m. Lantus dose was decreased from 18
units to 16 units and the NovoLog sliding scale was started.
On 11/10/2006 , she was noted to continue to have lower sugars in
the morning , but routinely elevated sugars in the afternoon
greater than 200. She was started on q.a.c. NovoLog regimen.
However , on this regimen , she was found 1 morning to have a
fingerstick blood glucose of 33 and to be hypothermic with a
temperature of 94 taken rectally. This was thought to be
secondary to hypoglycemia which may have progressed over several
hours prior to assessment and her temperature returned to normal
at 98 after her blood glucose was aggressively repleted. It was
felt that the patient likely had decreased metabolism of her
injected insulin in the setting of worsening renal failure , so ,
her Lantus was decreased in accordance with a curbside
consultation with the diabetes management service. She will be
discharged home on a similar regimen to her home regimen simply
with a decreased Lantus dose down to 12 units nightly. She
should continue to monitor her fingerstick blood glucoses at
home. We were hesitant to change the types or timing of her
insulin during this hospitalization. I left that item to be
further managed by her primary care provider after discharge:
5. Hematologic: The patient has a chronic normocytic anemia
felt likely to be secondary to her chronic renal insufficiency.
Her iron studies were rechecked on this admission and her iron
studies were also normal. She was continued on Aranesp through
this hospitalization and she is on Procrit as an outpatient and
she will continue on that with further discussion with the GGVH
Renal Clinic after she is discharged.
6. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient was fluid
restricted to 2 liters of fluid per day p.o. and potassium and
magnesium were repleted as needed and she was maintained on a
cardiac diet. Prophylaxis was with Coumadin and Nexium.
DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will be discharged to home with VNA
services for some home physical therapy. She will follow up with
her primary care provider Dr. Bublitz at MHS and also with the
SRRH Cardiology Clinic and Renal Clinic. She should have her INR
checked within 4-5 days after discharge and her Coumadin
restarted when her INR is less than 2.5.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.
2. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.
3. Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily.
4. Folate 1 mg p.o. daily.
5. Lantus insulin 12 units subcutaneous nightly.
6. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7. Metolazone 2.5 mg p.o. daily as needed for fluid retention as
directed by your physician.
8. Multivitamin one tablet p.o. daily.
9. Torsemide 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. at 50 mg p.o. q.p.m.

ATTENDING: MANCHE , EARLE MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Dyspnea on exertion.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. CHF.
2. Stage IV esophageal cancer.
PRESENTING SYMPTOMS:
Mr. Kanaan is a 68-year-old gentleman with stage IV esophageal
cancer who was two weeks status post his third cycle of
chemotherapy for his cancer. He also had ischemic cardiomyopathy
with a known ejection of 20% and coronary artery disease status
post CABG in 1993. He presented with progressive shortness of
breath over the three days prior to admission. He denied any
fever. However , he did note increase in his weight and increased
lower extremity edema over the last week. He has three-pillow
orthopnea at baseline , but has been sleeping both upright for the
three days prior to admission. Two weeks prior to admission , he
was walking in the mall and was able to accomplish all of his
ADLs without difficulty. On admission , he was unable to walk
more than 20 feet without becoming severely dyspneic. He does
describe having diminished appetite , increased fatigue , and three
days of copious watery stool , possibly related to his
chemotherapy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for pneumonia two weeks ago treated as an outpatient ,
esophageal cancer stage IV status post chemo x3 cycles ,
obstructive sleep apnea , ischemic cardiomyopathy , COPD , atrial
fibrillation status post pacemaker and AICD placement , gout ,
pulmonary vasculitis , and also CAD.
OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
Include amiodarone , digoxin , colchicine , Atrovent , lisinopril ,
spironolactone , torsemide , Ativan , Zocor , and Prilosec.
ALLERGIES:
He has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He lives at home and denies alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
The patient was afebrile with the temperature of 95.8. His heart
rate was in the 90s. His blood pressure was 90/60 breathing at a
rate of 22. His room air oxygenation was 82% , but increased to
98% on 3 liters nasal cannula. He was slightly uncomfortable
sitting straight up in bed and visibly tachypnic. His lung exam
demonstrated bilateral scattered wheezes throughout the lung
fields and bibasilar crackles. His JVP was approximately 15 cm.
Heart exam reveled regular rate and rhythm with prominent S3.
Abdominal exam was nontender. His extremities had 2+ pitting
edema to the knees.
PERTINENT LABS:
On admission , he had a creatinine of 1.7 , which is at his
baseline and BUN of 46. His BNP was 2960 , CK 48 , CK-MB 1.0 , and
troponin 0.1. Hematocrit 44.5 , white count 7.8 , and D-dimer was
150. His INR was 1.3.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
The patient had a palliative esophageal stent placed on 4/5/05 .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient presented with exam and labs
findings consistent with decompensated heart failure. For this ,
he had a known ejection fraction of 20%. While he was in the
hospital , he had strict I's and O's and was diuresed with Lasix
and torsemide. His diureses was somewhat limited by systolic
blood pressure with a range of 85 to 110 during his
hospitalization. On discharge , his weight was down to 82.1 kg
and was down from 87.5 on admission. The patient did have slight
leak in his troponin of 0.1 on admission , but his EKG was
unchanged and his enzymes x3 were negative except for the
troponin , which did not trend to higher. His cardiac medical
regimen was maximized with an ACE inhibitor or statin and baby
aspirin was started on him. He was discharged home on torsemide
100 mg daily in addition to his spironolactone dose.
2. Pulmonary: The patient received Atrovent nebulizers in-house
to help with his shortness of breath. His primary etiology ,
however , was pulmonary edema secondary to decompensated heart
failure. His diuresis goal of 1.5 liter a day was achieved with
the combination of dopamine , nesiritide , and Lasix drips. He was
most responsive to combination of nesiritide and dopamine. At
the time of discharge , the patient's room air saturations were
94% with ambulatory saturations of 86%. He was therefore
discharged home with oxygen to use overnight and when
symptomatic.
3. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with diarrhea
that was felt to be related to his chemotherapy , which has been
completed two weeks earlier. Stool was sent out for C.
difficile , which was negative. His colchicine was initially held
because of his diarrhea , but the patient then developed a flare
of his gout in his right great toe. Colchicine was resumed to
treat this with good results. The patient received palliative
stent to his esophagus on 4/5/05 that is placed by Dr. Cap
without complications. The patient had plans to follow up with
is outpatient oncologist for ongoing care of his esophageal
cancer after discharge.
4. Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.7. His baseline
chronic renal insufficiency was with the creatinine of
approximately 1.3 to 1.5. At discharge , his creatinine was 1.6 ,
which has been stable throughout his entire stay. He briefly
required having a Foley catheter placed on 4/4/05 because of
urinary retention , but it was removed the next day without
difficulty and did not have problems with voiding prior to
discharge.
5. Hematology: The patient was placed on DVT prophylaxis with
Lovenox. He did exhibit some right leg edema more pronounced
than his left leg edema , but this is felt to be due to his gout
in his right great toe.
The patient was discharged to home with services and PT was
arranged to go and do a home safety evaluation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:
The patient's vital signs were stable. He was resting
comfortably in bed. Crackles in his lungs were notably
diminished from admission. He no longer was tachypnic. His
heart had a regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , occasional S3. No
murmurs. Abdomen was soft and nontender. His extremities had
trace pitting edema.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiodarone 300 mg daily.
2. Colchicine 0.6 mg every other day.
3. Digoxin 0.125 mg every other day.
4. Ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily.
5. Lisinopril 5 mg daily.
6. Ativan 0.5 mg b.i.d.
7. Spironolactone 12.5 mg daily.
8. Trazodone 50 mg at night.
9. Multivitamins one tablet daily.
10. Torsemide 100 mg daily.
11. Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d.
12. Simvastatin 80 mg at night.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was discharged to home with services. He had
instructions to follow up with his primary care doctor , Dr.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , IN-STENT
RESTENOSIS
PROBLEM LIST: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
2. IN-STENT RESTENOSIS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Segonia is a 53-year-old female
with a cardiac history as follows. In
October of 2001 she presented with substernal chest pain and had a
positive exercise tolerance test. Cardiac catheterization at
Tormor Community Hospital revealed a 40% LAD , 50% left circumflex ,
80% RCA , and 90% RCA. Stents were placed to both the proximal and
mid RCA lesions. In August of 2001 , the patient represented with
substernal chest pain and had a positive exercise tolerance test.
Cardiac catheterization revealed in-stent restenosis. She was
treated with angioplasty and brachytherapy. In July of 2002 , she
underwent repeat cardiac catheterization for recurrent angina and
was again found to have in-stent restenosis. Again , she underwent
a angioplasty to zero percent. Later in July of 2002 , she
presented with chest pain; however , cardiac catheterization
revealed no significant stenosis. Finally , in September of 2002 , the
patient presented with her usual chest pain and a cardiac troponin
I of 0.15. MIBI showed inferior ischemia and cardiac
catheterization showed an RCA instent restenosis. She underwent
PTCA without stenting.
Today , the patient presents complaining that she has had a sharp
chest pain across the precordium with onset three days prior to
admission and was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. Her
symptoms were intermittent until the day of presentation when she
experienced 10/10 chest pain that was only partially relieved with
sublingual nitroglycerin and was associated with shortness of
breath. She presented to Vic Storgre Hospital Emergency Department
where she was given aspirin 225 mg , nitroglycerin sublingually
x one , and Plavix 75 mg x one. On presentation , her blood pressure
was 98/54 and she was given one bolus of heparin 5 , 000 units.
While in the Emergency Room she had recurrent pain and was started
on intravenous nitroglycerin.

bradycardia at 49 with normal axis , normal intervals and no acute
ST changes. A T-wave inversion seen in lead III on 3/12/02 was no
longer present.
HOSPITAL COURSE: ( 1 ) Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted for
cardiac catheterization on 5/6/02 , which
revealed a 90% in-stent restenosis of the RCA stent. No
intervention was made at that time. Post cardiac catheterization
she was kept on Plavix , aspirin , atenolol , Zestril , lipitor , and
intravenous TNG. Because of recurrent chest pain on 8/11/02 she
was restarted on heparin. There was an attempt to wean both the
intravenous TNG and heparin on 9/4/02 with a planned transition to
p.o. Isordil. However , the patient again had chest pain at rest ,
leading to restarting of a heparin drip and intravenous TNG. There
were no EKG changes at that time and the pain was relieved by
nitroglycerin. Of note , the patient did have a small hematoma and
bruit at the right femoral artery catheterization site. Ultrasound
of the groin on 9/4/02 was negative for pseudoaneurysm. Because
of recurrent in-stent stenosis , the patient is planning to be
transferred to Tia Mid- Health Of in Che A Fay on 9/1/02 for
Robimycin coated stents.
( 2 ) Hematology: The patient was maintained on intravenous
unfractionated heparin with a goal PT of 60-80. Her PTT on the day
of discharge was in therapeutic range.
( 3 ) Renal: The renal function was stable post catheterization.
CODE: The patient is full code.
DISPOSITION: The patient is planned to undergo transfer to Foote Health in Mi for Robimycin
coated stents. The transfer will take place by ambulance on

6. Insulin dependent diabetes.
7. Hypothyroidism.
8. Mild hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old woman
with past medical history significant for osteopetrosis ,
persistent atrial fibrillation , baseline dementia , and
hypothyroidism who presents at a transfer from DCMC
to the Bona Pase Ro Health with a nondisplaced hairline
fracture of the left femoral neck noted after the sudden
development of severe pain with ambulation on March , 2005.
Her husband describes her developing leg pain when weightbearing
as she was getting out of car in March , 2005. He denies any
recent fall and trauma. Transfer paper from SH
suggest , the patient may have fallen prior to admission. Her
baseline , her husband states , Ms. Maisey can walk with a walker ,
uses bathroom herself , feed herself , and handle petty cash and
recognizes family members. She needs assistance with bathing and
remainder of her actual daily living. He reports that his wife
has been confused since early after admission to MMHC .  He states that she does not drink alcohol.
As per her past medical hospital , Mr. Debem states that his wife
has not suffered a heart attack , although she did have
difficulties for heart rhythm and he recalls for having a stress
test but no cardiac catheterization. The patient's cardiologist
did send copies of a recent vicinity inspect in January 2005 and was
negative for ischemia and echocardiography. She was admitted to
the Orthopedic Service on June , 2005 , for hip replacement
and has since then transferred to the Medicine Service on
November , 2005 , for medical management.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 96.9 , pulse 94 ,
blood pressure 142/68 , respiratory rate 16 , and O2 saturation 94%
on room air. In general , the patient was somnolent , arousable ,
but confused but no apparent distress. HEENT: Normocephalic and
atraumatic. Anicteric sclerae. Pupils were equal and round to
light. She had moist mucous membranes and no lymphadenopathy.
Her neck was supple with full range of motion. Chest had faint
bilateral crackles at the bases right greater than left.
Cardiovascular: She had irregularly irregular rhythm. S1 and
S2. No murmurs , gallops , or rubs. JVD was less than 10 cm.
Abdomen: Soft and nontender and mildly distended with positive
bowel sounds. Extremities: There was no edema. DP were
palpable bilaterally. She was warm and well perfused. Neuro:
The patient was alert and oriented to self only. She was
somnolent , follow command , but no focal abnormalities were noted.
PERTINENT LABORATORY TESTS AND STUDIES: TSH within normal
limits. CT head on June , 2005 , showed a possible old small
left posterior frontal contusion. CT pelvis on June , 2005 ,
showed a hairline left femur fracture plus osteopetrosis. EKG
was irregularly irregular but otherwise unremarkable. Urine
cultures taken on March , 2005 , and February , 2005 ,
no growth to date. Stool Clostridium difficile , toxin assay has
been negative to date as well taken on the February , 2005.
Chest x-ray on admission was unremarkable. Chest x-ray following
surgery was significant for bilateral pleural effusions right
greater than left. Chest x-ray on the morning of discharge
significant for bilateral pleural effusion somewhat improved over
prior study.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: On January , 2005 , Dr. Leslie did a
Girdlestone on May , 2005. Dr. Hepp , a left hip
hemiarthroplasty. Please see a full dictated operative notes for
details.
HOSPITAL COURSE: She is a 76-year-old female with atrial
fibrillation , dementia , and presenting with a left hip fracture
for orthopedic surgical correction on June , 2005. She had
a surgery but without complication and a postoperative course
complicated by delirium , atrial fibrillation with RVR , and new
hyponatremia.
1. Ortho: She presented with left femur hairline fracture. She
had a Girdlestone procedure performed and a left hemiarthroplasty
performed without complications. She was treated postoperatively
with cefazolin and has been discharged will be discharged on
Keflex. She developed a mild incisional cellulitis with no signs
of abscess and no fever.
2. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: She was screened preop in the determined
intermediate risk. She was given a beta-blocker for surgery and
has no signs of symptoms of ischemia throughout this
hospitalization.
B. Pump: The patient was found to be mildly hypertensive and
was started on lisinopril with good control.
C. Rhythm: The patient with known atrial fibrillation. She
developed a rapid ventricular response on postoperative day #3.
Heart rates in the 140s. Blood pressure was stable. This was
difficulty to control with IV and p.o. beta-blocker , calcium
channel blockers , and digoxin so she was IV amiodarone loaded and
is currently undergoing a p.o. amiodarone load as well. To date
on January , 2005 , she has had seven days of p.o. 400 mg t.i.d.
and with current loading plan is seven more days of 400 mg
amiodarone b.i.d. followed by 400 mg q.d. indefinitely. She is
currently weight controlled. Heart rates in the mid to low 60s.
She is getting amiodarone and Toprol-XL 300.
3. Neurology: The patient has baseline dementia and per husband
was developing delirium prior to transfer to Bingvent Medical Center .  Differential diagnosis of this delirium infection
versus medications versus electrolytes. This is also complicated
by stress of surgery. Psychiatry was consulted , and initially
she was restarted on her Cymbalta. However , this was stopped
development of hyponatremia. Postoperatively , the patient has
slowly improved in terms of mental status and this new baseline
at discharge.
4. Infectious Disease: The patient has been afebrile
throughout. There was a report of a Gram-negative UTI at the
outside hospital for which she received a course of Levaquin.
She received postop prophylaxis of cefazolin until the September , 2005 , when this was stopped. Subsequently , she had increased
her white blood cell count to 23 , but no fever. UA , chest x-ray ,
and stool for C. diff was sent and are all negative to date. Her
white count has subsequently come down to 17 on the day of
discharge , and she has remained afebrile. Keflex was restarted
given the possible incisional site mild cellulitis , and she to be
continued until the staples were out after seven days course with
improvement. The patient developed a nonbloody diarrhea on
May , 2005. C. difficile studies were sent and have come
back negative to date. She was started on prophylactic dose of
Flagyl , which will be discontinued prior to discharge.
5. Pulmonary: The patient developed pleural effusion postop but
never was compromised in terms of oxygenation or ventilation.
She is making modest improvement at discharge and was self
diuresing.
6. Fluids , Electrolytes , and Nutrition: On admission , the
patient had a sodium of 140 which seems to gradually dropped to
her course to a nadir of 119 on the November , 2005. No obvious
med changes except for the SSRI that was subsequently stopped.
She was started on free-water restriction and urine lytes were
drawn. These lytes were consistent with picture of SIADH , so
free-water restriction has worked. On the day of discharge , her
sodium is 131 , and she should be continued on free-water
restriction and recheck in a week. Otherwise , electrolytes were
repleted p.r.n. The patient was given a low fat ADA diet.
7. Endocrine. The patient's sugars are moderately well
controlled on regular insulin sliding scale. NPH insulin was
added and has been titrated up to 12 units q.a.m. with regular
insulin sliding scale for coverage on top of that. The patient
with known hypothyroidism was euthyroid on admission. TSH was
within normal limit. Her home dose Synthroid continued and
should be indefinitely.
8. Hematology: Given the patient atrial fibrillation , she had
been on Coumadin at the outside hospital; however , on
presentation , her INR was subtherapeutic at 1.2. She was put on
Lovenox prophylactic dose prior to the surgery , and following
surgery Coumadin was restarted and up titrated to 30 range. On
discharge , she was therapeutic with an INR of 2.0 , Coumadin dose
of 5 mg q.h.s. Her hematocrit has fell following the surgery ,
and she has transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells on
May , 2005. Since then , her hematocrit has increased
appropriately and she has been stable throughout her rest of
admission. On discharge , the hematocrit was 39.0.
9. Prophylaxis: Given her high risk for DVTs , the patient was
prophylactic with Lovenox while waiting for her INR to become
therapeutic. She also given pneumo boots and TED stocking.
Finally , she was given Nexium for peptic ulcer disease
prophylaxis. No consultants were called; however , the orthopedic
service initial have this patient contact would be Dr. Scott E Kercy .
At discharge , she is afebrile , T max of 97.9 , pulse between 49
and 64 , blood pressure between 98 and 120/44 to 60. She is
breathing 18 times per minute and satting between 94% and 98% on
room air. Fasting sugars have been well controlled. On exam ,
she is in no apparent distress. She is alert and oriented x2 to
place and person but not the time. She is also alert to her
situation. HEENT: Her pupils are equal and reactive to light.
She has anicteric sclerae. Chest exam , she has slightly
decreased breath sounds at the right base but no crackles or
wheezes. Cardiovascular: She has irregularly irregular S1 and
S2. No murmurs , gallops , or rubs. Abdomen: Soft and obese with
mildly distended positive bowel sounds , nontender. Extremities:
Warm and well perfused. She has left hip incision with staples
with no signs of dehiscence but a 5 cm round area of erythema
which is nontender. Neuro exam is nonfocal.

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Jason Kassing , NP
SERVICE: WH
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Buetti is a 49-year-old woman
with a history of CHF , COPD on 3 to 4 liters at home , CAD , status
post CABG , PE with a recent admission for cellulitis complicated
by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation as well as
recent admission for shortness of breath and fluid overload
complicated by PE while anticoagulated leading to a pulseless
electrical activity. The patient was also admitted to DHC from
5/15/06 to 07 for respiratory distress again with fluid
overload requiring diuresis. The patient was discharged to the
En General Hospital .  On the day of admission , the patient
complained of burning chest pain and shortness of breath
different from her previous cardiac chest pain. The patient also
notes that she did not feel well.

ALLERGIES: None.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is homeless , but occasionally lives
with family. No tobacco history. Positive ETOH. Positive
addiction , methadone.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Vital signs stable. Cardiac ,
irregularly irregular. No murmurs , gallops or rubs. Pulmonary ,
bibasilar crackles and wheezes. Abdomen , firm , distended ,
nontender , no rebound or guarding. Lower extremities , edematous.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A1 49-year-old woman with a history of CHF ,
COPD , CAD , status post CABG , status post PE with CHF exacerbation
complicated by acute renal failure , hyperkalemia and UTI.
PLAN:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. Because of the patient's new
onset of CHF , she was ruled out for MI shortly after admission.
Serial enzymes and EKGs were negative for ischemia. The
patient's chest pain , however was not consistent with the
patient's usual cardiac pain. During her stay , the patient was
maintained on an aspirin , beta-blocker and a statin , although the
chest pain was gone on arrival to the ED. Throughout the three
months of the patient's stay , she did experience similar burning ,
substernal chest pain. EKGs and enzymes sent during these
episodes were always negative for ischemia. It was felt that
this pain was likely secondary to GERD , as it often responded to
Maalox , benzo , lidocaine and/or food.
2. Pump: The patient's primary symptoms of shortness of breath
likely due to fluid overload. The patient was diuresed with IV
Lasix on the medicine floor. However , on 10/22/06 , the patient
experienced somnolence , low respiratory rate and desaturations in
the setting of opioid administration for pain. The patient
responded partially to Narcan and was transferred to the CCU for
three days for increased monitoring and continuation of diuresis
with a goal of negative 2 liters per day. The patient was
transitioned off methadone and on to oxycodone p.r.n. The
patient was maintained on BiPAP and given albuterol and DuoNeb
inhalers. She passed through this acute decompensation with no
further complications and was transferred back to E on
7/7/06 .  On the floor , the patient was transitioned to p.o.
Lasix. She was diuresed with a goal of 1 to 1.5 liters per day.
IV Lasix were administered p.r.n. shortness of breath/physical
exam consistent with fluid overload. One week prior to transfer ,
the patient was transitioned back to IV Lasix as her daily output
had slowed on p.o. Lasix , she was unable to make TBB goals. On
transfer , the patient shows signs of fluid overload , lower
extremity edema at bedtime BiPAP requirement , but relatively
while pulmonary compensation. The patient's dry weight is about
200 pounds.
3. Rhythm: The patient has a history of afib. She was rate
controlled with Lopressor and verapamil. She was also
anticoagulated for both her afib and a recent PE with an INR goal
of 2 to 3. Rate control was obtained with the beta-blocker and
calcium channel blocker. During the stay , the patient's heart
rate is often slightly faster than goal ranging in the 90s to
110s. Further rate control is limited by the patient's BP with
systolics often in the 90s to 100s. The patient was begun on
verapamil , which was titrated up with her beta-blocker , which was
titrated down. On transfer , the patient was on verapamil 60 mg
p.o. t.i.d. and atenolol 70 mg p.o. daily.
4. Pulmonary: The patient's pulmonary issues as described
above. The patient also has a history of PE and COPD/asthma.
Post MICU , the patient was maintained on 4 to 5 liters oxygen by
nasal cannula and during the day with BiPAP at nighttime. The
patient's O2 requirement remained stable until transfer , although
requiring albuterol nebs p.r.n. The patient was kept on Coumadin
for PE with an INR goal of 2 to 3.
5. Renal: The patient's baseline creatinine was 0.8. On
admission , the patient had ARF felt to be due to CHF/volume
overload leading to poor cardiac output , decreasing perfusion to
the kidneys. As the patient was diuresed , her renal function
improved. This was stable throughout her stay until 10/24/06
when her creatinine began to rise. It was felt that this was due
to a combination over diuresis leading to a prerenal state. No
medication changes have been made near that time except for Lasix
p.o. to IV. In the setting of creatinine bump , Lasix and
spironolactone were discontinued on 10/12/06 .  On 10/25/06 , Lasix
20 IV daily was restarted because of an improving creatinine , but
again held when creatinine returned as 1.5. On transfer , the
patient not on Lasix secondary to creatinine bumps/ARF. We did
not hydrate but monitor creatinine and continue diuresis when
able. Likely prerenal secondary to intravascular depletion
caused by liver cirrhosis leading to poor intravascular
albumin/osmotic pressure. In the setting of discontinuing of
Lasix and poor renal function , the patient did become
hyperkalemic x2 during the week of transfer. The patient did not
initially respond to Kayexalate and lactulose , as she did not
have a bowel movement likely due to opioid use. The patient did
respond to insulins and D50. On 5/30/06 , the patient again had
the elevated potassium to 5.5 , Kayexalate and lactulose x2 ,
produced two bowel movements lowering her K appropriately.
6. ID: During the stay , the patient was treated for UTI with a
three-day course of levofloxacin. Upon discharge , the patient
was asymptomatic.
7. GI: The patient was known to have vascular ectasias in her
stomach. The patient is still guaiac positive during her stay
with no active bleeding. Complicating this is the patient's need
for anticoagulation secondary to recent PE and afib. This is
felt to be the cause of her slowly dropping hematocrit for which
she required occasional weekly transfusions of packed red blood
cells. The patient on a PPI b.i.d. The patient also has
cirrhosis leading to poor synthetic function , poor intravascular
osmotic pool contributing to fluid overload.
8. Heme: As above , the patient required several transfusions of
TIBCs , although no more than once every one to two weeks. Felt
due to slow GI losses.
9. Endocrine: During the patient's stay , she was on a basal
Lantus with Aspart coverage. This was titrated up to achieve
good glycemic control. On discharge , the patient was on Lantus
42 units subcu at bedtime and Aspart 10 units a.c./h.s. with an
Aspart sliding scale. This achieved fingerstick glucoses of 120s
to 160s.
10. Psych: The patient has a history of addiction and came to
SMH on methadone. During the patient's stay , methadone was
tapered and the patient transitioned to oxycodone. The patient
often complained of back pain and burning foot pain felt to be
neuropathy , which was relieved by opioids. The patient often
refusing NSAIDs. On transfer , the patient was on oxycodone 5 to
10 mg p.o. q. 6 h. p.r.n. pain , often taking 10 mg x4 a day. The
patient also complaints of anxiety and insomnia for which 0.5 mg
of Ativan achieved good resolution. At transfer , the patient was
not on standing Ativan just requiring occasional one-time orders
at bedtime. Neurontin was also titrated up during the patient's
stay. Finally , the patient was started on nortriptyline at
bedtime for pain with good effect.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: The patient was alert and oriented
x3 sitting up in a cardiac chair , able to walk to the bathroom
unassisted. Off of O2 , although does experience mild shortness
of breath. Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Cardiovascular ,
irregularly irregular with no murmurs , gallops or rubs.
Pulmonary , faint bibasilar crackles and no wheezes. Abdomen ,
distended and nontender. Extremities , warm , well perfused with

TO-DO PLAN: To accepting MD.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
1. Fluid balance. The patient is still volume overload with a
baseline weight at 200 pounds , however , the patient
intravascularly dry likely secondary to cirrhosis. Discharge
diuresis was limited by acute renal failure likely prerenal. The
patient has received packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit
and for colloid fluid resuscitation. The patient responds to
Lasix 40 mg IV or 80 mg p.o. Please continue when renal function
improves.
2. Electrolytes. The patient hyperkalemic twice this week
secondary to poor urine output and acute renal failure , responds
to lactulose and K. The patient's EKG was unchanged.
3. GI bleed. The patient has vascular ectasias in her GI tract ,
however , she is on Coumadin for afib and PE. She is on Nexium 40
mg p.o. b.i.d. and her stools are guaiac positive.
4. Heme. The patient has a slowly dropping crit , might be
secondary to the slow GI bleed. Transfused with a goal
hematocrit greater than 25. Her INR goal is 2 to 3.
5. Physical therapy has worked with the patient and she is able
to get out of bed to the bathroom by herself , though slowly.
6. Pulmonary. The patient is on BiPAP at night , able to secure
facemask on by herself. She is on 4 to 5 liters of nasal cannula
during the daytime , though she often takes , but removes the
oxygen.
7. Psych/Pain: The patient is on oxycodone at minimum , has
received 10 mg x3 a day , now at 4 to 5 per day. The patient is
full code.

Discharge Date: 10/4/2006
ATTENDING: DRAPEAU , TRINIDAD MD
DISPOSITION:
To home with VNA service.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Status post MVP with 30 Cosgrove ring , AVR with a 25 CE and PFO
closure and MAZE.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
Hypertension , diabetes mellitus type 1 , gout , paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation , prolapse mitral valve with moderate MR.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with past medical history
significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation , severe aortic stenosis and moderate MR. His
symptoms also consisted of dyspnea on exertion. He states that
he gets short of breath walking on an incline after one to two
blocks. He has no angina , orthopnea , no neurologic symptoms.
Stress echo on 8/10/06 showed no evidence of ischemia but
importantly a fall in BP with exercise and was not able to go
beyond 2.5 minutes due to fatigue. Echo also demonstrated an
aortic stenosis with a neck area of 0.9 cm2 with a peak gradient
35 , mean of 21 , and a junctional moderate MR from myxomatous
prolapse. Cardiac cath at GMH on 3/4/06 showed single-vessel
CAD involving LAD. The patient was initially scheduled to
undergo AVR , plus MVP and MAZE on 1/26/06 .  Preop chest x-ray
revealed pulmonary fibrosis and mild pulmonary edema , which was
also confirmed with CT of chest without contrast. PFTs were
suggestive of restrictive lung disease. Pulmonary service was
consulted and it is considered that the patient's fibrosis has
not progressed and that new chest x-ray changes may be likely due
to his interstitial pulmonary edema. It was suggested that the
risk of pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery would be
moderate. Carotid ultrasound showed 65-70% RCA occlusion , which
is asymptomatic. The patient is rescheduled for AVR , plus MVP
and plus MAZE on 5/5/06 .
PREOPERATIVE CARDIAC STATUS:
Elective. The patient presented with valve dysfunction with
history of class II heart failure. Recent signs and symptoms of
congestive heart failure included dyspnea on exertion/pedal
edema. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

Bypass time: 219 minutes. Crossclamp time 156 minutes. There
were no complications. The patient was transferred to the unit
in stable fashion with lines and tubes intact. In the ICU ,
starting postop day #1 , the patient was extubated , postop day #2
remains AV paced. Transferred to Step-Down Unit on postoperative
day #2.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: Pain control , Toradol.
Cardiovascular: On Coumadin , captopril issues was being AV paced
through a.m. with transfer and now in first-degree AV block ,
holding Lopressor.
Respiratory: No issues , have been extubated postoperative day
#1.
GI: Passed speech and swallow. Diet was advanced as tolerated ,
Nexium for GI prophylaxis.
Renal: Started Lasix 20 b.i.d.
Endocrine: Diabetes insulin treatment with subq insulin.
Hematology: Anticoagulation with Coumadin , recent MAZE
procedure/atrial fibrillation.
ID: No issues.
Transferred to the Stepdown Unit where he
proceeded to progress well. Postop day #2 , chest tubes removed
wires left in. Postop day #3 , slow junctional rhythm with rates
in the 40s being externally V paced , rate of 88 and wires not
working. EP states if further rhythm is not recover by postop
day #4 to #5 to reconsult. Foley reinserted for retention of 400
mL output. Started Flomax. On low-dose Coumadin for MVP/MAZE in
case pacemaker was needed. We will need rehabilitation upon
discharge. Post-day #4 remains to be V paced with junctional
rhythm. The wires are in and do not conduct or capture. EP
feels the patient may require pacemaker , we will observe for now.
Upper extremity noninvasive studies for left greater than right
arm swelling , negative for DVT. Holding Coumadin pending
possible pacemaker placement. Past video swallow today for
regular diet.
Postop echo pending for MVP. Rehabilitation when medically
ready. Postop day #5 , postop showed slow junctional rhythm with
EP following for possible pacemaker , and they set a pacemaker at
heart rate of 40. The patient in junctional rhythm/afib , heart
rate in the 60s , A wire and do not conduct or capture. V wire
set at a backup rate of 40. EP just came by and feels patient is
likely recovered conduction. Possibly an atrial fibrillation
versus accelerated junctional with heart rates in the 80s and
thinks pacemaker will not be indicated. Plan to discontinue
wires in a.m. if the patient's rhythm remain stable.
Postop echo done for MVP. EF 55% , No comment on MR. Foley
discontinued last night after insertion voiding well today on
Flomax. Low-dose Lovenox anticipate eventual discharge to
rehabilitation on Lovenox/Coumadin and bridge after pacemaker.
White count up slightly to 11.1 low-grade temps. UA negative.
Rehabilitation when medically ready given possibility of
pacemaker requirement. Postop day #6 , spoke with EPS as the
patient is in stable sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block ,
okay to remove wires implanted for pacemaker , ambulating well for
room air. We plan to send to rehab when bed available. Postop
day #7 , the patient was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery Service to
be stable to discharge to home with VNA service with the
following discharge instructions.

Discharge Date: 1/25/2003
ATTENDING: DORIAN GENEREUX MD , PHD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Muschaweck is an 80-year-old woman
with known history of congestive heart failure and flash
pulmonary edema who presents with gradually increasing shortness
of breath for 2 weeks. Patient denies any chest pain , nausea ,
vomiting , palpitations or syncope. She does acknowledge sitting
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for approximately 48
hours before admission , no lower extremity edema. She denies any
changes in diet or changes in medical adherence. She states her
weight has been about constant at 180 pounds on her home scale.
She does note that she has poor exercise tolerance at baseline
but even now unable to perform activities of daily living for 48
hours , so she came to the Istbern Sentne Emergency Department with her
daughter. She was found to be hypertensive , hypoxic with
clinical and chest radiographic evidence of congestive heart
failure. She was treated with oxygen , IV Lasix and nitro-paced
in the ER and admitted for further treatment of her CHF
exacerbation. Her physical exam revealed a heart rate of 52
beats per minute , respiratory rate of 20 , blood pressure of
176/74 , and she was satting 97% on 4 L of oxygen. The patient
was in no acute distress , she is pleasant , a little overweight ,
alert and oriented times person , place and time. Her jugular
venous pressure was approximately 12 cm of water. She did have
pulses parvus et tardus , no Kussmaul sign. She had rales
one-half way up the pulmonary fields bilaterally. Her heart was
regular rate and rhythm , bradycardic. There was a 3/6 systolic
murmur with a slurred S2. Her abdomen was benign. She had no
lower extremity edema. She had cool extremities and neurologic
exam , other than patient being alert and oriented , was nonfocal
with no motor deficits.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Revealed a sodium of 142 , potassium 4.2 ,
chloride 105 , bicarb 26 , BUN 31 , a creatinine 1.9 , a glucose of
152. A white count within normal limits , a hematocrit of 41.8 , a
platelet count of 289 , calcium 8.8. Her coags revealed a PTT of
32.7 , an INR of 3.2 , her creatine kinase was 41 , her MB fraction
was 1.9 , her troponin was negative. Her BNP , brain natriuretic
peptide , was 885. Her chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary
edema. Her EKG showed sinus bradycardia at
48 beats/minute. No significant ST or T-wave abnormalities. No
significant from change from 1/8 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Patient has known aortic stenosis with an
AVA of 1.0. She has coronary artery disease status post acute MI
in 2001 , status post two-vessel CABG , she had the left internal
mammary to the LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the OM-2. She
has atrial fibrillation , for that she is on amiodarone and
Coumadin. She has diabetes mellitus. She has
hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease ,
bladder cancer status post resection.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Amiodarone 300 mg each day.
2. Aspirin 81 mg each day.
3. Lasix 120 mg by mouth twice a day.
4. Zestril 40 mg po each day.
5. Zocor 40 mg p.o. every night before bedtime.
6. Niferex 150 mg twice a day.
7. Insulin NPH 48 units in the morning and 4 units in the
evening.
8. Levoxyl 25 mcg each day.
9. Coumadin 2.5 mg on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , and 3 mg on
Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday , Sunday.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She denied all vises , such as tobacco , alcohol or
drugs. She lives with her daughter , Severi .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As in HPI , no fever , chills , rash , medications
changes or urinary symptoms.
ASSESSMENT ON ADMISSION: She was an 80-year-old woman with known
coronary artery disease here with a chief complaint of worsening
shortness of breath consistent with congestive heart failure
exacerbation most likely left-sided diastolic dysfunction. There
was no clear etiology , however , dietary or medication issues were
not likely given the patient's excellent awareness and
involvement in her care. The suspicion was that the patient may
have had increasing blood hypertension out of control , increasing
oxygen demand and creating diastolic function and pulmonary
edema. The role of her aortic valve was unclear , however , there
may have been gradual progression and renal artery stenosis
cannot be rule out as an etiology.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: In terms of her cardiovascular system , she
was diuresed with IV Lasix and her electrolytes were followed
closely. She came in with a weight of 84.7 kg and left with a
weight of 83.7 kg. For two days in the middle she was diuresed
with IV Lasix
120 mg b.i.d. and she was converted to oral Lasix and actually
continued her diuresis , in fact after pacemaker placement , which
will be noted below , she may have actually continued to urinate
even more so on the last day of her admission. Her blood
pressure was stable throughout her stay , in the low 100s ,
consistently below 150 systolic and above 100 systolic.
Rhythm: In terms of her rhythm , she was found at several points
throughout her stay in the first several days to have bradycardia
consistent with junctional rhythm and because of her atrial
fibrillation treated with amiodarone; it was thought she would
benefit from a pacemaker also because of her beta-blocker. So , a
pacemaker was placed on 6/21/2003 without complications. The
pacemaker was a dual-chamber PPM. Her INR before it was placed
was 1.7 , and there was some oozing from the site , however , her
hematocrit was stable and her hemodynamics were stable for 24
hours after the procedure. Electrophysiologists analyzed the
device and found that it was working properly. She is scheduled
for follow up with Dr. Gutirrez on 4/13/2003 at 9:40 in the
morning. She has been advised to limit her driving until that
appointment. She has also been advised that she will not be able
to have an MRI in the future. She will be discharged on Keflex
( cephalexin ) 250 mg p.o. 4 times a day for 3 days on discharge
for her pacemaker and if she has any problems at all with her
pacemaker she should call Dr. Richel at
telephone # ( 851 ) 491-7503 , adetc # 33243.
2. Pulmonary: The patient had PFTs done in 9/18 which showed
an FVC of 73% of predicted , FEV1 of 77% of predicted , and FEV1 to
FVC ratio of 108% , and FEF 25/75 of 80% , a TLC of 50% of
predicted , an SVC of 73% of predicted , a residual volume of 40%
of predicted , and an RV/TLC of 72% of predicted. Her DLCO
uncorrected was 44%; her DLCO corrected was 44%. During her
stay , patient had low O2 saturations at rest ranging from the
high 80s to the low 90s , but often below 88% and on exertion
consistently in the mid-80% range , not depending on where the
probe was placed. She was unable to be weaned from the oxygen
and will be sent home on oxygen. She should be followed up with
a CT of the chest. A CT of the chest was done on this admission ,
however , it was consistent with CHF and other things could not be
ruled out. Of note , on the chest CT there were found to be liver
lesions which will be commented on below. The patient should
also be worked up for her pulmonary issues.
3. Radiology: The patient had this chest CT which showed
multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities in the lungs , diffuse
haziness , some septal thickening with slight basil predominance ,
multiple borderline mediastinal nodes in the anterior
mediastinum , an AP window region with the largest node on image
21 measuring 1.3 x 2 cm , there were extensive vascular
calcifications , cardiomegaly with multi-chamber enlargement and
particularly dense coronary calcifications , trace right and left
pleural effusions. Visualized organs of the upper abdomen
demonstrate multiple ill-defined low attenuation foci in the
liver but no other abnormality. Review of bone window shows
extensive thoracic degenerative change , sternal wires and
epicardial pacer leads. The lung findings were consistent with
cardiomegaly and CHF , but could not rule out other diagnostic
possibilities including atypical pneumonia , hypersensitivity ,
pulmonary hemorrhage or less likely lymphangitic tumor. In order
to workup the liver mass , an ultrasound of the abdomen was
attained. The liver showed a mass 2.9 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm , it was
hyperechoic in the posterior segment of the right lobe of the
liver corresponding to the dominant mass seen in the CT of
7/21/203 and 11 , gallbladder was normal with no stones ,
the biliary tree was normal , as were the right kidney and left
kidney , pancreas , although it was poorly visualized. The spleen
was normal , the aorta was normal , pleural effusion was noted on
the left which was small and prominent hepatic veins were noted.
The radiologist's impression was that the ectogenic mass on the
right lower lobe of the kidney corresponded in the location of
the mass reported on prior CTs , may be a hemangioma or other
ectogenic masses which could not be excluded and he noted that
the patient could not hold her breath sufficiently well to
evaluate the mass with Doppler. If indicated , the PMD should
either get a nuclear scan , CT , the radiologist suggested MRI but
that is now impossible given the pacemaker , for confirmation and
further evaluation. Also , it was noted that she had prominent
hepatic veins possibly due to the right heart failure.
OTHER ISSUES:
4. Endocrine: The patient was continued on her Levoxyl 25 and
her home dose of insulin with good blood sugar controls generally
below fingerstick of 200.
5. Heme: The patient was continued on her Niferex. Her
hematocrit was stable throughout her stay with her admission
hematocrit being 41.8 and discharge hematocrit being 38.8. Her
white count also was not elevated. She is discharged with a
white count of 6.8. Her INR on admission was 3.2 , her Coumadin
was held and 1 mg of vitamin K was given before her procedure.
Her INR on the day of the procedure , 6/21/2003 , was 1.7 and on
discharge it was 1.3. She will be reinstituted on her same
Coumadin level , to follow up with Dr. Garder and to have her
Coumadin level checked on 5/25/2003 and be followed as she was.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: As admission medicines except #1 , she will
be taking cephalexin for 3 days and that is the only difference.
Her primary care doctor can consider can titrating her CHF
medicines and/or her hypertension medicines.

A/P: 77F w ho CAD p/w chest pain of sudden onset: Original ddx includes
acs/usa/PE/hypertensive urgency or emergency/msk/chf. Given the excellenet
response to heparin and a negative cardiac catheterization , and the
continuoation of pain despite control of hypertension , the cardiac team
felt that the most likely diagnosis was a pulmonary embolism. However , had
neg lenis and PE CT , so unlikely PE. She was discharged home with follow up
with Dr. Sollitto and with her usual PCP. Will need monitoring of lytes and
Cr given possibility of contrast induced nephropathy in setting of
underlying elev Cr.
**CV: ( i ): Chest pain was initially concerning for ischemic pain;
however , cardiac catheterization was unchanged from prior cath. She
will continue asa/plavix/BB/statin; she ruled out for MI w serial
enzymes and ekgs. Given an intermediate to high probability story
and an intermediate V-Q scan , she was continued on heparin and PE protocol
CT of chest was obtained , which was neg for PE but showed a pulmonary
nodule; she will need repeat CT for nodule f/u in 6-12 months. Excellent
oxygentation , stable walking and nearly pain free at time of discharge.
( r ): no active issues , telemetry monitoring was nl.

ATTENDING: MULLALY , DOMINIQUE THEO MD
This is an interim dictation from 7/3/06 through 04 while
the patient was on the General Medicine Service.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease likely due to her
diabetes mellitus. The patient's postoperative course was
significant for contrast induced oliguric acute renal failure. A
renal consult was obtained on 2/6/06 and the patient was seen
by Dr. Studdard to evaluate her acute on chronic renal failure.
Dr. Cowlin that her acute renal failure may be due to chronic
kidney disease from renovascular disease or possibly due to
interstitial nephritis in the setting of a drug allergy. The
patient was also seen by Dr. Shope , Erik Garret Manuel F.
from the Nephrology Department while she was an inpatient. After
consideration of possibilities causing her acute renal failure ,
it was thought that her acute renal failure was most likely due
to cholesterol emboli syndrome given her eosinophilia , stepwise
progression of renal impairment and her chronic course. The
patient will need to be followed by a nephrologist as an
outpatient. In addition ,
the patient has known renal artery stenosis that may have
contributed to her acute renal failure and she did have a
possible drug allergy to diuril and perhaps a component of her
renal failure was also due to acute interstitial nephritis. On
1/27/06 , the patient developed gross hematuria. At this time ,
the urinalysis showed red blood cells but no evidence for
ATN. This gross hematuria was in the setting of a
worsened coagulopathy. She had a renal ultrasound at that time
that was negative for renal obstruction. Gradually with
resolution of her coagulopathy , the patient's urine output
increased and her creatinine improved with supportive measures
alone. The patient did have gradual improvement in her urine
output and her creatinine decreased to 2.8 prior to discharge.
The patient is currently off diuretics at this time. Daily
weights should be checked and if her weight increases by more
than 3 pounds Dr. Bockoven should be notified. The patient was also
started on calcitriol given elevation of parathyroid hormone.
Cardiovascular: Rate and rhythm: The patient has a history of
atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. The
patient was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.6 h. for rate
control , however , this dose was decreased to 12.5 mg p.o. twice a
day , given some bradycardia on her telemetry. The patient was
also started on Flecainide 75 mg p.o. q.12 h. She will continue
on these two medications upon discharge.
Congestive heart failure: The patient had evidence for
congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension during this
hospitalization. The patient did become volume overloaded on
physical examination with an oxygen requirement , elevation of her
JVP and shortness of breath. She was diuresed with Lasix during
her postoperative course. The patient was transferred to the
medical Service on 2/10/06 for management of her renal failure
and volume overload. The patient did undergo a trial of renally
dosed dopamine to see if this medication improved her cardiac
output and renal function. The patient showed no improvement on
this medication and it was discontinued after a short trial. The
patient's diuresis was discontinued prior to discharge as the
patient did have acute worsening of her renal function , which may
have been related to over aggressive diuresis. The patient was
instead started on spironolactone for management of her
congestive heart failure. As stated above , she should have daily
weights checked.
Ischemia: The patient has no history of coronary artery disease.
She was maintained on aspirin , statin and a beta-blocker during
the admission.
Hematology: The patient was started on iron supplementation for
her anemia in the setting of chronic kidney disease. The
patient's Coumadin was held briefly in the setting of a
coagulopathy that she developed on 1/27/06 .  The patient was
evaluated by the Hematology Service and was seen by Dr. Codilla and
Dr. Vallas from the Hematology Service for workup of her
coagulopathy. The patient had elevation of her INR to 5.8 and a
slight reduction in her hematocrit to 25 , as well as elevation of
her PTT to 97. Workup included factor 7 level , mixing study ,
anticardiolipin antibody , lupus anticoagulant , Von Willebrand's
panel , hepatitis B and C testing as well as complement levels.
The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells as well
as 2 units of FFP on 1/27/06 as well as vitamin K with much
improvement in her coagulopathy and increase in her hematocrit to
about 29. The patient should not receive any
heparin flushes. The patient showed no evidence for DIC or
hemolysis. Her coagulopathy was most likely thought to be due to
residual Coumadin with factor deficiency in the setting of her
decreased renal clearance. At this time , the results of the
inhibitor screen are pending and should be followed up as an
outpatient. The patient was restarted on Coumadin prior to
discharge. Her INR goal is 2 to 3 and her Coumadin dosing should
be monitored by Dr. Hynum . Her current Coumadin dose is 1 mg
p.o. once every evening and her most recent INR 1.2. The patient
will follow up with Hematology as an outpatient.
Infectious Disease: The patient had a wound culture that grew
pseudomonas for which she was briefly treated with a course of
ceftazidime. The patient completed a course of ceftazidime and
remained afebrile off antibiotics with no signs of active
infection. A wound care consult was obtained for the patient's
decubitus ulcer. She should have DuoDERM dressing applied every
three days to her ulcer.
Pulmonary: The patient continues to have an oxygen requirement
despite diuresis. She did not show clinical signs of pneumonia.
Her oxygen requirement is thought to be due to atelectasis ,
deconditioning , as well as her known congestive heart failure and
likely pulmonary hypertension. She requires supplemental oxygen
at 2 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations in the
mid 90s. This should be continued at her rehabilitation.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and was
followed by the Diabetes Nursing Service during her stay. She
was on Avandia during the admission in addition to Lantus and
NovoLog before meals. Upon discharge , the patient will be on
Avandia 4 mg p.o. every noon as well as NovoLog 4 units
subcutaneous before every meals in addition to a NovoLog sliding
scale. The patient was also started on thyroid supplementation
and will be on Synthroid as an outpatient.
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient had hyponatremia
thought to be in the setting of volume overload and total body
water excess. This improved somewhat with diuresis. In
addition , the patient developed dysphagia with liquids during her
hospitalization. She was evaluated by the Speech and Swallow
Service and had evidence of aspiration on bedside swallow
examination as well as video swallow examination. The patient
was also evaluated by the ENT Service and was seen by Dr.
Cassetty on 11/26/06 .  On laryngoscopy , she was found to have a
left vocal cord paralysis. She underwent MRI imaging of her neck
and chest. She did not have any evidence of mediastinal mass and
no abnormalities of the recurrent laryngeal nerve were seen.
Gradually , the patient has had some mild improvement in her
hoarseness and dysphagia. She benefits from turning her head to
the left with each swallow to minimize the risk of aspiration.
The patient was also followed by the Nutrition Service throughout
her hospital stay.
Vascular: The patient is status post left femoral distal bypass
on 8/21/06 .  The patient continued to be followed by the
Vascular Surgery Service during her hospitalization. She should
have three t.i.d. wet-to-dry dressings applied to her left lower
extremity up to her thigh daily. She will follow up in Vascular
Clinic with Dr. Skreen in two weeks upon discharge.
Allergy: The patient had a DIURIL induced drug rash. She showed
no signs of mucous membrane involvement and no signs of
Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on a PPI as well as her
Coumadin.
Disposition: The patient was followed by the Physical Therapy
Service while an inpatient and will benefit from inpatient
rehabilitation.

ATTENDING: REOPELL , ROLF M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
This is the diagnosis responsible for causing the admission is
sinus arrest with apnea.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of nonischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy ( EF of 55% on this admission , although
prior admission indicating an EF of 35% ) , diabetes , obstructive
sleep apnea , obesity hypoventilation syndrome , atrial flutter
status post ablation. On 5/24/05 , he presented with shortness
of breath as well as a witnessed apneic episode. His recent
history is significant for having stopped his Lasix dose one week
prior to admission due to increased frustration with
incontinence. Since then , he has had increasing shortness of
breath , orthopnea , bilateral lower edema , and dyspnea on exertion
to the point of symptoms upon walking 10 feet. In the Centsshealt Careman Inerist Medical Center Emergency Department , he was found to be
saturating 91% on room air and 99% on a nonrebreather. An ABG
showed a pH of 7.31 and a PCO2 of 55; he was tried on BiPAP
without improvement in either PCO2 or PO2. While being
interviewed by the medical residents , he was seen to have a
30-second apneic episode with loss of consciousness and cyanosis;
his sensorium quickly returned after this event , although he
retained no memory of this occurrence. He received Lasix 80 mg
x1 , Solu-Medrol , and DuoNebs in the ED. He was admitted to the
CCU initially with CHF/apnea/sinus arrest , and subsequently
transferred to the hospital floor when he was stable.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Congestive heart failure , nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy ,
2/13 echo with an EF of 35% and global left ventricular
hypokinesis; 7/18 echo with an EF of 55% , without hypokinesis.
2. Atrial flutter , status post ablation ( 2003 ).
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Hyperostosis frontalis.
5. Complex renal cyst versus angiomyolipoma , resected via
laparoscopy in 8/2 .
6. Morbid obesity with obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
7. Obstructive sleep apnea.
8. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline creatinine 2 ).
MEDICATIONS:
1. Allopurinol.

employee. He is an ex-smoker , quit in the 1960s. He is a heavy
drinker in his 20s , but now he rarely drinks alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Gastric cancer in his father.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature of 96 , pulse of 53 , blood pressure of 125/65 , and
saturating 94% on 2 liters by nasal cannula. In general , alert
and oriented , in no acute distress. HEENT: Pupils are equally
round and reactive to light , sclerae are anicteric , moist mucous
membranes. Cardiovascular exam: Regular rate and rhythm , normal
S1 and S2 , although JVP difficult to assess due to body habitus.
Lung exam: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no wheezes or
crackles. Abdomen: Obese , soft and nontender , normal abdominal
bowel sounds. Extremities: 2+ edema.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:
Notable for creatinine of 2.3 ( at baseline ) , BNP of 500. His
admission EKG: Sinus rhythm with occasional bradycardia to the
40s , no ST changes.
SUMMARY OF THE HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE:
Assessment and Plan: A 71-year-old female with a history of
obesity hypoventilation syndrome , restrictive lung disease ,
diabetes , nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with a preserved EF ,
who was admitted for congestive heart failure , sinus arrest ,
ultimately treated with diuresis and a pacemaker placement.
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: No active issues during this
hospitalization. Pump: The patient had a history nonischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy with a preserved EF , ( an echo during this
hospitalization revealed an EF of 55% without hypokinesis ,
although prior echo in 2003 showed an EF of 35% with global left
ventricular hypokinesis ). On admission , the patient had signs
and symptoms of volume overload in a setting of having not taken
his Lasix for about a week. He was admitted initially to the
CCU , and subsequently transferred to the floor , with aggressive
diuresis of approximately 10 kg since admission ( including
diuresis with ultrafiltration in the CCU ). Following transfer to
the floor , he was switched to Lasix diuresis , which was titrated
down gradually to 40 mg daily , ( cautioned with administration
giving a rise in creatinine ). The patient was also maintained on
captopril , which was up titrated to 25 mg t.i.d. ( held at one
point due to the rise in the creatinine ). The patient was also
titrated up on metoprolol to 25 mg b.i.d. Rhythm: The patient
was followed by the Electrophysiology Service. In the CCU , he
was noted to have sinus arrest of 8-9 seconds in the setting of
apnea. Following transfer to the floor , he was noted to have
sinus arrest of 4 seconds , again in the setting of apnea. His
last such episode was on 8/16/05 .  In addition , the patient has
history of atrial fibrillation/flutter , status post ablation. On
4/30/05 , he underwent pacemaker placement through cephalic
veins , which he tolerated well.
2. Pulmonary: The patient , as noted above , had several episodes
of apnea , some of which were associated with sinus arrest.
Following diuresis , the patient's apnea episodes improved. He
was recommended for formal sleep study as an outpatient.
3. Renal: The patient was admitted with a creatinine roughly
around baseline ( 2 ) , which rose briskly during his
hospitalization to a peak of 3.2 on 4/30/05 .  His FENa on
admission was 6-8%; a repeat FENa in the setting of his peak
serum creatinine of 3.2 and following 10 kg of diuresis was
1.86%. His urine eosinophils were negative. His UA showed
evidence of a UTI plus triple phosphate crystals; urine culture
showed greater than 100 , 000 colonies of mixed morphology. It was
thought that the rise in the patient's creatinine was likely due
to a combination of intravascular depletion and possibly UTI.
The patient was started on antibiotics following his pacemaker
placement , which would be expected to cover GU microbial flora
and SNHU microbes.
4. Endocrine: The patient had a history of diabetes and was
maintained on a Regular Insulin sliding scale.
5. ID: The patient was expected to having an UTI as noted
above. Following his pacemaker placement , he was placed on
cefazolin while in-house , followed by Keflex. The patient should
stay on Keflex for four days.

ADMIT DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure , aortic valve and
mitral valve dysfunction.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is 59-year-old female who is
status post mitral valve repair , aortic valve repair , history of
endocarditis , history of rheumatic heart disease , hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus , and congestive heart failure who presents with
increasing shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal
pain. She has been under significant stress at home since last
summer and notes slowly declining health since that time. She
has had increasing shortness of breath as well as dyspnea on
exertion since September 2004 and has gotten worse in the past one
month , and even significantly worse in the past week. The
patient notes increasing lower extremity edema on the right side
greater than the left. She states that this is her baseline with
the right side being more than the left. She has no increase in
her abdominal girth , the patient has two-to three-pillow
orthopnea ( from one-pillow orthopnea , one month ago ) , she does
have some paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , she has no increased
nocturia. The patient notes that the shortness of breath is ""not
angina; I do not have that."" She does not have any
lightheadedness , diaphoresis , or radiation of pain. The patient
says that she does not check her weigh at home , but ""knows"" she
is in failure when she is short of breath. She also notes
nausea , vomiting , and some abdominal pain stating that it started
about a week and a half ago. She had gone to see the ED on the
Sunday prior to admission where the patient reportedly had a
benign exam , low-grade temperature , given recent Levaquin for an
upper respiratory tract infection , she was then started on Flagyl
for a possible C. difficile infection. The patient's diarrhea
stopped , but she had still remained some abdominal pain and
increased cough , which was nonproductive. She went to her PCP on
the day of admission for increasing shortness of breath and was
sent to the ED for diuresis. In the ED , she was given 60 mg of
IV Lasix with good output per report. She did have some decrease
in her shortness of breath shortly thereafter. She also
complained of 10/10 abdominal pain and was given some Dilaudid.
On the floor during the interview , she did have some projectile
vomiting. She was able to pass gas. She reported no fevers ,
chills , or night sweats. She reported no bright red blood per
rectum. She reported no change in her bowel , bladder , or urinary
habits.

at 65 beats per minute. She had frequent PVCs. There was a
normal access. There were some nonspecific T-wave inversions.
CHEST X-RAY: Showed mild vascular congestion. There was no
evidence of any effusion.
IMPRESSION: This is a 59-year-old female with a rheumatic heart
disease , status post St. Jude's MVR and AVR , congestive heart
failure who presents with mild volume overload and abdominal pain
with nausea and vomiting.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: When the patient was admitted , she was ruled out
for an MI. She did have a slight increase of her troponins ,
which were attributed to mild demand ischemia. In addition , she
had some slight anemia , which could also be contributed to the
demand as well in addition to the clear volume overload. She did
fine from the standpoint , had no ST changes on any of her EKGs.
The patient laid her head workup for future AVR and MVR with the
Surgical Service , with Dr. Bio . Her workup was extensive and
included a cardiac catheterization , which showed no significant
coronary artery disease. The hemodynamics were notable for the
following: RA of 12 , PA of 92/23/44 , pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 22 with V waves to 42. The mitral valve was grossly
normal with appropriate leaflet motion. The AV was also grossly.
The overall conclusion was elevated right-sided heart pressures.
She had no evidence of major atherosclerotic disease of the
coronary arteries.
b. Pump: Please see cath report as above. The patient was
admitted and diuresed with IV Lasix , so she came down to a
euvolemic state. Her diuresis was continued with 80 mg IV Lasix
on a b.i.d. basis. She was diuresed until there was a subsequent
bump in her creatinine to 1.8 , 1.9. After that point , diuresis
was slowly modified. She was then placed back on a regimen of
120 mg of p.o. Lasix q.o.d. That is the dosing of Lasix on which
she is discharged.
c. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation that has been rate controlled with a beta-blocker.
On admission , her digoxin was stopped. She was evaluated by the
EP Service. They recommended epicardial lead placement at
surgery due to her tachybrady syndrome. The patient was
discharged on diltiazem 30 mg q.i.d. She will have her
medications modified status post her valvular repair in the very
near future.
d. Presurgical workup: In addition to echo , right and left
heart cath , the patient had a TEE performed. TEE showed normal
left atrial appendage without evidence of localized thrombus.
St. Jude's valve was well seated in the aortic position. There
was no significant aortic regurg that was noted. A St. Jude's
valve was well seated in the mitral position as well. There was
trace mild regurgitation noted. There was slight asynchronous
motion of the prosthetic valve apparatus that was noted. The
tricuspid valve was normal in appearance. There was mild
regurgitation present. Visualized portion of the thoracic aorta
revealed minimal atheromatous plaque.
2. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from her pulmonary
standpoint. She continued to sat well on room air. She did not
required any nebulizers during her stay.
3. GI: The patient was initially admitted with some abdominal
pain and also nausea and vomiting. She had a KUB performed for a
question of potential bowel obstruction. A single frontal view
of the abdomen was obtained and is reported in the final
radiology report. There was gas seen within the loops of small
bowel as well as the colon. There is no bowel dilatation seen.
The overall impression was no evidence of any high-grade bowel
obstruction. It is likely that some of her pain was secondary to
hepatic congestion. The nausea and vomiting eventually resolved
and perhaps this is some type of viral illness or
gastroenteritis. She did have some episode of diarrhea prior to
admission along with some abdominal cramping. The patient was
continued on her PPI for GERD prophylaxis. At one point , she
required increasing her dosage of Nexium secondary to GERD-like
symptoms. It seemed that increasing the amount of Nexium she
received , precipitated some diarrhea. She was returned to a
normal dosing of Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. while in-house. She was
discharged on omeprazole 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , which she will
continue to take as an outpatient. In addition , she was given
prescription for Colace and also Senokot today. She should
continue using.
4. Heme: Her hematocrit remained relatively stable during her
stay with averaging of 26 to 27 as far as her hematocrit. We
were not concerned with keeping her hematocrit 30 or above at all
times given her clean coronary arteries seen from the left and
also right heart catheterization. She did have a slight dip in
her hematocrit at one point requiring two units of packed red
blood cells. Her hematocrit bumped appropriately to 30 or 31.
She required no subsequent transfusions thereafter. With regard
to anticoagulation , she was placed on the heparin drip at 950
units per hour to maintain a PTT between 60 and 80 secondary to
her mechanical valves that are in place. On discharge , the
patient was transitioned to Lovenox 60 mg b.i.d. with a renal
dosing. She will continue to take this Lovenox as an outpatient
and stop it one to two days prior to her surgery as instructed.
She has home VNA in place.
5. Renal: Her BUN and creatinine was relatively stable on
admission. It did elevate to as high as 3.3 , 3.4 on her
admission secondary to her ongoing diuresis. When diuresis was
held for several days given her markedly increased urine output
and as she became more hydrated and euvolemic , her creatinine
returned to its baseline of 1.2 , 1.3. She has no active issues
now.
6. Endocrine: We appreciated the Diabetes Service for following
her very closely while in-house. Several modifications were made
to her regimen while here to get good control of her blood
glucose. She was maintained on a stable regimen of NPH 60 units
in the morning , NPH 30 units in the evening. She also was placed
on a sliding scale. She also received NovoLog of 15 units in the
morning with breakfast and also 15 at dinner. She was not
receiving any of the NovoLog while at lunch. She will continue
to take this regimen in home. All of her prescriptions were
provided by Carl Mcclenahan , who is following with the Diabetes
Service. They will become again involved with her care as she
plans for surgery in the very near future.
7. Infectious disease: The patient was stable from an ID
standpoint during her entire admission. On September , 2005 , the
patient was noted to have an increase in her white blood cell
count upwards towards the 20 , 000. This was one day prior to a
planned surgery on April , 2005 with Dr. Villata to repair her
aortic valve and also her mitral valve. The surgery was delayed
as a result of this , so an infectious workup could ensue. She
had a urine sent that showed , the suggestion of a urinary tract
infection. Levaquin was given for treatment of her UTI.
Surveillance cultures were drawn daily. Given the fact that she
had a right groin hematoma that performed after the heart
catheterization we questioned whether or not this could be some
type of infectious source. She had the hematoma aspirated , it
was negative for any organisms. She had no other identified
places as far as source of infection. It was believed that she
could potential have endocarditis as she has had in the past.
One of her cultures actually grew out a species of Abiotrophia.
There is only one culture positive , that was taken on February .
She has had no subsequent cultures growing out at the time of
this dictation. We appreciate the Infectious Disease Team
following. Their recommendations were to hold antibiotics unless
subsequent cultures began to grow out. Their recommendations
were to continue to follow all cultures and to perform a TEE. A
repeat TEE was performed and showed no evidence of any lesions or
change in bowel function. There were clearly no vegetation seen
on either any transthoracic echos or TEEs. ID made
recommendations as far as perioperative antibiotics , which would
include two weeks of ceftriaxone 1 g IV b.i.d. under the
assumption that this would be completing a course of her therapy
after SBE. They would also recommend sending all valve tissue
for Gram stain and culture as well as pathology. If the Gram
stain and culture were positive , they would suggest extending the
course of the above-mentioned antibiotic therapy.
8. Neurologic: The patient was given Darvon and also codeine as
needed for her pain. She complained of right groin pain
secondary to the hematoma. Her pain is much improved that she is
able to ambulate easily around the Tl Brown Vo on discharge. The
hematoma is resolving and her pain is resolving as well.
9. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient is
tolerating p.o. well. Her electrolytes were repleted as needed
daily.
10. Psychologic: The patient was seen by social work. It is
clear that she has many anxieties about the surgery and also in
going home and returning to her social environment. She
necessitated volume prior to many procedures given her severe
anxiety.
11. Disposition: The patient is stable from a medical
standpoint with all cultures clear and no evidence of active
infection. Her white blood cell count is now normal. She is now
awaiting surgical repair of her valve and will have a surgery
scheduled with Dr. Berreth office in the next one to two weeks.

Discharge Date: 7/20/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: HYPERLIPIDEMIA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Legions is a 54 year old professor
at A No Sa , status
post coronary artery bypass graft ( 5 vessel bypass ) 8 years ago who
presents with recurrent substernal chest pain times one day. The
patient was transferred from Phlukester Hospital after developing the
acute onset of substernal chest pain while driving his automobile.
The patient was under no extraordinary circumstances ( e.g.
emotional stress , exertional stress ) at the time he developed chest
pain. Since the time of his five vessel CABG in 1987 , the patient
had experienced no intercurrent angina.
The patient's coronary risk factors include a positive family
history and a previous diagnosis of hyperlipidemia. However the
patient does not have hypertension , diabetes and he is not a
tobacco smoker.
As mentioned , the patient's chest pain was substernal and radiated
to the upper epigastrium. He experienced an element of burning
with exertion. Prior to this episode of recurrent chest pain , the
patient had had multiple exercise tolerance tests which were read
as normal. He graded the chest pain at 8/10.
The patient presented to G urgent care where his pain was not
relieved with four sublingual nitroglycerin. An EKG demonstrated
lateral ST wave depressions. The patient was transferred to
Skaggssin Hospital where IV TNG , morphine and Nifedipine were given.
The patient's pain decreased to a level of 4/10. Despite these
maneuvers , the patient's pain continued through the night and in
the morning. In the morning , he received additional morphine and
IV Heparin was begun. Subsequently the patient became pain-free.
The patient was transferred to Ck Health Of for
further management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hyperlipidemia. Bilateral anterior and
lateral thigh achiness with exertion
times six months ( workup in progress ).
MEDICATIONS: On presentation to Menjack Hospital Medical Center ,
Lovastatin 40 mg q q.m. , 20 mg q p.m. and
enteric-coated aspirin one tablet q day.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM A,XO COMMUNITY HOSPITAL IV nitroglycerin , IV heparin , Nifedipine SL , morphine as
well as aspirin and Lovastatin.
The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's father developed angina secondary
to coronary artery disease at age 54 and died
at age 75 from an MI.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives at home with
his wife. He works as a professor at
Rieglemoinesro A Shing and restores buildings in his free time.
HABITS: The patient denies tobacco use. He is an
occasional alcohol drinker.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , Mr. Latimer is
a pleasant middle-aged man , mildly
anxious but in no acute distress. Vital signs on transfer:
temperature 98.6 , heart rate 78 , blood pressure 110/78 , respiratory
rate 22 with oxygen saturation of 99% on 4 liters of oxygen.
HEENT: unremarkable. Neck: no jugular venous distention ( JVP
less than 6 cm ) , carotids were 2+ bilaterally with no bruits or
delayed upstroke. Lungs: clear with good breath sounds
bilaterally. Coronary: regular rate and rhythm with good heart
sounds and a clear Sl and S2. There were no rubs , murmurs or
gallops appreciated. There was no S3 or S4. The point of maximum
impulse was not displaced. The patient's spine was not tender and
there was no evidence of costovertebral angle tenderness. Abdomen
had good bowel sounds and was soft and nontender to palpation. No
masses were palpated. Groin demonstrated decreased femoral pulses
bilaterally with a faint left femoral bruit. Rectal: normal
rectal tone with an anodular prostate. Stool was soft , brown and
guaiac negative. Extremities demonstrated no clubbing , cyanosis or
edema. The patient's pulses at the dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibialis were 2+ bilaterally. Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
Electrolytes on presentation were within normal limits. His LFTs
were notable for a slight increase in his LDH to 252. The
patient's first CK on presentation was 2300 with a quantitative MB
of 10.2 ng/ml. Cholesterol was 79. Albumin 2.8. Protime 12.4 ,
INR 1.1. PTT 40.7 , consistent with heparin therapy. CBC was
notable for a normal white count , hematocrit and platelet count.
Urine had a specific gravity of 1.021 , pH 5 , negative dipstick
evaluation.
Chest x-ray demonstrated clear lung parenchyma and no bony
abnormalities. EKG on admission to Raldmance Mountbay
showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 73 with normal intervals
and an axis of 0. The patient had Q waves in leads 3 and F and
biphasic T waves in leads V4 through V6. There was minimal change
in these abnormalities with resolution of the patient's pain. Of
note , EKGs taken at Townileahli Medical Center during the patient's initial
admission were notable for T wave depressions in leads V4 through
V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Intensive Care Unit on IV heparin and
nitroglycerine as well as continuation of his aspirin and
Lovastatin. The patient's pain was treated with morphine sulfate.
His CKs were followed serially every 8 hours and achieved a peak CK
of 2790 on 6/16/95 at 12 a.m. with an MB fraction of 188.8 ng/ml.
Thereafter the patient's CKs rapidly declined. On 3/30/94 , the
patient's CK was 317 with an MB fraction of 3.5 ng/ml.
After 24 hours pain-free in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit , the
patient was transferred to the Cardiac Step-Down floor. His IV
nitroglycerin and IV heparin were discontinued and the patient
remained pain-free. Echocardiogram performed on 6/16/95
demonstrated inferior and posterior hypokinesis with an ejection
fraction of approximately 46%.
On 3/9/95 , the patient underwent exercise tolerance testing with a
submax modified Bruce protocol. The patient exercised 9 minutes
and was able to complete the study without dyspnea on exertion or
chest pain. He achieved a maximum heart rate of 108 and a
maximum blood pressure of 160/80. EKG was notable for unifocal
PVCs and up to 2 mm ST depression in leads V2 through V4 which
persisted up to 15 minutes into recovery. The patient was given
one sublingual nitroglycerin and these EKG changes resolved.
The exercise tolerance test was interpreted as strongly positive
for ischemic coronary artery disease.
On 1/9/95 , the patient underwent a submax MIBI to assess coronary
perfusion of the heart. Similarly , the exercise component of this
examination demonstrated EKG changes consistent with ischemic
coronary flow. Nuclear imaging demonstrated a fixed apical lateral
defect in the patient's heart consistent with a healed or healing
transmural infarct. There was no evidence of ischemic reperfusion
defects.
The results of these tests were discussed with the patient and his
wife in conjunction with the treating medical team of Dr. Settecase .
The patient was offered the opportunity for coronary
catheterization to evaluate his anatomy , but he declined at the
present time. It was decided that the patient would be maximally
medically managed and discharged to home with close followup under
Dr. Cockburn and Dr. Stenkamp . The patient's cardiac medications were
appropriately adjusted while an inpatient to achieve maximum
cardiac benefit.
On presentation , the patient also complained of progressive
anterior and lateral thigh pain. This pain was brought on by
exertion and had increasingly limited his ability to walk over the
last six months whereas he had been able to walk four to five miles
a day in recent months. He had been able to walk only
approximately one-quarter mile before developing pain in his
anterior thighs as well whereas he had been able to climb several
flights of stairs a few months ago. He now was able to walk only
half a flight to a flight of stairs at a time before having to
rest. Six months ago , the patient had achieved a 25 pound weight
loss but , by his report , because of his inability to exercise
effectively , he had regained 15 pounds. The patient did not
experience this same anterior thigh pain while riding a bicycle or
swimming. As an inpatient , Mr. Woollen underwent a non-invasive
vascular study of the femoral and popliteal arteries. These
demonstrated no significant arterial occlusions as assessed by
pressure manometry. The possibility of myositis or neuromuscular
compromise was entertained and these are to be followed up as an
outpatient.
The patient also complained of symptoms consistent with an upper
respiratory viral infection which he had been experiencing over the
past two weeks. While an inpatient , he had a number of febrile
episodes , achieving a maximum temperature of 101.4. The patient
was treated symptomatically with Tylenol and started on Biaxin 500
mg po bid. He received a five day course of oral Biaxin with
resolution of his fever and decrease in his symptomatology.
The patient never complained of shortness of breath , palpitations ,
diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting or recurrent chest pain as an
inpatient. However physical examination demonstrated rales 4 to 5
cm above the bases bilaterally. The extremities remained free of
edema and the patient's jugular venous pressure never exceeded 6
cm. A chest x-ray on 5/7/95 demonstrated evidence of early
congestive heart failure. The patient was treated with daily doses
of IV Lasix with resolution of his rales. By the time of
discharge , there was no evidence of continued heart failure and the
patient's Lasix was discontinued.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg po q day
2. Cholestyramine one packet po q hs
3. Lovastatin 20 mg po q hs
4. Lopressor 50 mg po tid
5. Sublingual nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets to be taken prn
with chest pain
DISPOSITION: The patient is being discharged to home with
followup in MERH under Drs. Dwayne Ariel Bremme .
The patient was instructed to call CMH Urgent Care if his chest
pain recurs and does not resolve with sublingual nitroglycerin.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a 64-year-old with known CAD , atherosclerotic peripheral
vascular disease , and type 2 diabetes presented with back pain. She
describes a sudden onset of 8/10 stabbing back pain 4 days ago without
a clear precipitant. The pain was non raditating and partially releived
with analgesics.She denied any bowel or bladder incontinence or saddle
anesthes ia. She denied any fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , or
diarrhea. She does however complain of some urinary frequency ( on
lasix ) in the last few days with out any dysuria or urgency. Of note
over the past month she has had increasing had shortness of breath
however she denies any orthopnea or PND. The patient has long standing
pedal edema and has increasing abdominal distension over the last month
but has not noticed any change in her weight. The patient has CAD and
her angina equivalent is jaw pain.However in the last 6 months she has
had intermittent left sided chest pain that radiates to her left arm.
In the ED the patient was ruled out for an aortic dissection , MI and
had a negative D-Dimer. However lipase levels have been elevated with
norm al LFTs. She was admitted with a diagnosis of pancreatitis.
Hospital course:
1.GI- S/P cholecystectomy. Her lipase was mildly elevated on
admission to 200 , fell to 60 with NPO and IVF. However , MRA read with
radiology 4/4 shows diffuse atherosclerotic disease including
stenosis of celiac artery , vascular surgery was consulted for concer
about mesenteric ischemia. They do not think she is having symptoms of
ischemia , would like abdominal MRA to further assess abdominal
vasculature. Triglycerides very high , could be cause of her
pancreatitis , starting gemfibrozil. LDL was 151.
2.Cardivascular- Ischemia-On a beta blocker , statin , ARB , ruled out
for an MI , but has 6 month history of chest pain. Adenosine MIBI
negative. Started gemfibrozil. Pump-We changed atenolol to toprol XL
and amlodipine.
3.Endocrine- Has had poor glucose control. HbA1c 13. We continued
NPH qhs and started AM NPH as well.
4.Renal-Chronic renal insufficiency , Cr stable.
5. ID - Patient c/o urinary frequency. U/A negative.
6.Psych-On amitryptilline and fluoxetine.

In the ED , labs were all within normal limits. While on a monitor she
had an episode of bradycardia to the 40s. Dr. Hilmer of
the EP service interogated the device and indicated that it was
working properly with no arrhythmias. Telemetry in the ED also did
not record the bradycardic episode , suggesting that perhaps it was an
artifact. Pt's toxicology screen was negative. Her vitals in the ED w

also that she has been non-compliant in the past. PT was on Coreg but
this was held prior to admit for low BP's. Pt was hypertensive w/ SB
P 150's while inpt but we will d/c pt off Coreg and defer to Dr.
Doniel for reinstitution of beta blockade
2. NEURO: pt's neuro exam was normal with no focal signs , and no signs
of cerebellar dysfunction. Nevertheless given her significant vascular
risk factors there was concern for vertebral-basilar insufficiency.
MRI/MRA was not possible given pt's AICD/pacer. Upon discussion w/
team CT/CTA were deferred given pt's renal insufficiency and risk of
contrast nephropathy coupled with our feeling that any findings would
not change pt management. This will be discussed with pt's PCP , Dr.
Benedict Wichern .
3. ENDO: pt was continued on home insulin regimen with coverage with
insulin sliding scale. Pt was found have a TSH of 158 FT4 1.8 , FT3 56.
Upon discussion w/ pt , she revealed that she had previously been
diagnosed and begun on replacement but did not know what it was for and
subsequently stopped it on her own. Pt started on synthroid to be f/u
w/endocrine. This may be the etiology of her symptoms.
4. Prophylaxis: Nexium; pt was already anticoagulated with ASA , plavix
and Coumadin.
5. Disp: Pt to follow-up w/ Dr. Kishaba for managment of CHF/BP , and
with Dr. Blagg for f/u of potential neurovascular etiology of symptoms.
Pt to f/u with endocrinology for managment of hypothyroidism.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. continue levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. f/u endo for management
2. f/u w/ Dr. Schryer for possible reinstitution of beta blockade and
CHF/BP management
3. f/u Dr. Hackborn for w/u potential vertebral-basilar insufficieny with
recognition of risk of iv contrast nephropathy vs utility of
information

SERVICE: ONCOLOGY INPATIENT Louis Stockwood His
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: APLASTIC ANEMIA , HERE FOR HICKMAN PLACEMENT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Norsingle history dates back to
1976 , when she was diagnosed with
aplastic anemia. She did not have a bone marrow donor match at
that time and was thus treated with steroids without significant
effect. She has been transfusion dependent since 1986 and has
required q.2 weekly packed red blood cell transfusions and p.r.n.
platelet transfusions for epistaxis. She has had multiple
complications of her aplastic anemia , including hemochromatosis ,
bronzed diabetes , history of hepatitis B and hepatitis C positivity
secondary to transfusions , avascular necrosis of both hips , status
post bilateral total hip replacements , chronic shoulder bony damage
( both orthopedic prostheses secondary to chronic steroid use ) ,
history of perirectal abscess with Klebsiella while neutropenic ,
history of multiple Port-A-Cath infections. Her past history is
also significant for status post total abdominal hysterectomy for
high grade SIL in 1997.
Today Ms. Marsek presents for placement of a Hickman catheter
which had fallen out at the beginning of April of this year.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for fever , chills , nausea , vomiting ,
abdominal pain , upper respiratory infection
symptoms , urinary tract infection symptoms , shortness of breath ,
chest pain , palpitations.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Desferal was last given two months
prior to admission; Methadone 10 mg
t.i.d.; oxycodone 5 mg 3-4 times a day; Percocet 2-3 tabs q.4h. p.r.n.
pain ( Ms. Borchert was counseled to intake no more than two
Percocets q.8h. ); Reglan 10 mg p.o. q.i.d. p.r.n. with meals for
nausea; insulin 50 units NPH in the morning , 10 units regular in
the morning , 10 units NPH at 5:00 p.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: VITAL SIGNS: 99.3 , heart rate
75 , blood pressure 120/74 ,
respiratory rate 18 , satting 100% on room air. HEENT: Pupils
equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular

S2 , no murmurs. ABDOMEN: Soft with normoactive bowel sounds; no
hepatosplenomegaly. She had no palpable liver nodules. She has
slight nonpitting edema bilaterally in her ankles which was
baseline. NEUROLOGIC: She was alert and oriented x3. Cranial
nerves II-XII were intact.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She has a distant history of alcohol use. She is
a single mother with three children , ages 13 , 9 ,
and 9.
FAMILY HISTORY: Remarkable for diabetes in multiple family
members.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Pettit is a 35-year-old woman with a long
history of transfusion dependent aplastic anemia
with multiple complications secondary to hemochromatosis and
chronic steroid use. She was admitted for replacement of a Hickman
catheter which had fallen out in April of this year. Prior to the
procedure she was transfused with two bags of platelets. She had
one bag of platelets on call to the Interventional Radiology Suite ,
but did not require these platelets. She was also transfused two
units of packed red cells for a hematocrit of 23. On July ,
1999 , she had a right internal jugular venous Hickman catheter
placed without difficulty. There were no complications from the
procedure. There is no pneumothorax by fluoroscopy. The tip was
in the proximal right atrium , okay to use. Both lumens aspirated
freely and were flushed with heparin prior to being sent back up on
the floor. On the evening of July , 1999 , Ms. Deboer began an
infusion of Desferal while in house , watching carefully for signs
of anaphylaxis , as she has not received an infusion in over two
months. After she completes her Desferal infusion , she will be
sent home with visiting nurse for Hickman catheter care and
followup with Dr. Keith Hermans in clinic.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good.
DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with home services for Hickman
catheter care and monitoring of CBC.

Discharge Date: 8/21/2003
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: L4-L5 , L5-S1 HERNIATED NUCLEUS PULPOSUS.
PROCEDURE: Revision decompression at S1 with iliac crest graft
fusion. Instrument fusion with a later iliac bone
graft.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68-year-old male with
a history of lumbar spinal stenosis ,
status post L3-L4 , L4-L5 foraminotomy , left-sided L5-S1 foraminal
decompression , and L4-L5 laminectomy with new L4-L5 , L5-S1
herniated nucleus pulposus , and lower back pain with radicular
symptoms. He described his back pain as 80% of his complaint , and
20% is his radicular symptoms. The pain is greater on the right
than on the left. He has had conservative management. He
complains of bowel and bladder changes with decreased rectal tone ,
and control with urine and feces. He denies any lower extremity
weakness or numbness throughout his perineum. He was recently seen
in the I Ieldwall Health Care Emergency Room on 1/11/02 , for low back
pain and sciatica; however , he left AMA. He presents for elective
decompression and instrument infusion of his lumbar spine.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Obesity , hypertension , diabetes mellitus ,
coronary artery disease , GI bleed. A
history of seizure disorder and peripheral neuropathy.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Bilaterally total knee arthroplasty;
shoulder surgery; aortic valve replacement ,
times two; cardiac catheterization; hydrocele repair.
MEDICATIONS: Please see nurse's note.
ALLERGIES: Coumadin , is not a true allergy , however , he has been
unable to achieve therapeutic INR.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a reformed smoker and drinker. He is a
retired salesman.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pertinent neurologic findings. Bilateral
lower extremity edema. Light touch is
intact throughout with slight decrease in bilateral feet consistent
with neuropathy , left greater than right. Decreased sensation.
Motor strength is 5/5 with the quads , hams , GS , TA , EHL. The left
side fatigues sooner than the right. A negative clonus. DTRs are
equal bilaterally quads , hams and Achilles. Capillary refill is
less than two seconds.
MRI from 6/17/02 , reveals left-sided L5-S1 herniated HNP with
foraminal narrowing.
The EKG shows no ST elevation or depression; however , there is no
prior study for comparison.
Laboratory values: Potassium 4.7. Hematocrit 38.5. INR 1.0.
Urinalysis negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent lumbar spine decompression
with L4-S1 instrument infusion with augmentation
of the iliac crest bone graft. Postoperative course was
uneventful. The patient remained afebrile , hemodynamically stable.
Autologous blood was necessary. He was required to maintain a
hematocrit above 30. He remained afebrile. Normal perioperative
antibiotics were given , however. His p.o. intake was delayed
secondary to delay in return of GI function. He did have an
episode of dark emesis early in his postoperative course on
postoperative day #1/2. He was slow to mobilize with physical
therapy. This was in part secondary to his pain level and also
intermittent confusion , for which a medicine consult was obtained.
Kayexalate was given for elevation of his potassium; otherwise , his
confusion resolved with decrease of his narcotic medications.
Physical therapy was able to resume. He was able to advance
appropriately. Hospitalization was prolonged secondary to waiting
for a rehab placement. At the time of discharge , his incision was
clear , dry and intact.

1 ) Lightheadedness: unclear etiology but most likely 2/2 elevated BP
>200s as sxs resolved with BP lowering. She was not orthostatic , hct at
baseline , cardiac enzymes negative , and prior MRI/MRA in 2004 without
acute process. Her BP remained well controlled back on her home regimen
( ? compliance but she states she was taking her meds ). Will have outpt
MRI/MRA done , though low suspicion for disease and unclear if would
intervene if disease present. Given HTN spells , concern for a cause of
secondary hypertension. Labs sent for plasma catecholamines , aldoseterone
and plasma rening ( pending as of discharge )
2 )DM: -Aspart SS while in house but continued her home DM meds on day of
discharge.
3 )Disp: d/c to home and she will f/u with Dr Laychock in clinic.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please be sure to take all of your blood pressure medications every day
as prescribed. We think your symptoms were caused by very high blood
pressures.
Please be sure to follow up with Dr Carlos .
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Please follow up with plasma catecholamines , plasma renin and

ATTENDING: LORENSON , REED MD
SERVICE:
RBMC .
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Rule out MI.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Angina , tachycardia , and hypertension.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
Hypertension , chest pain , GERD , coronary artery disease ,
osteoarthritis , anxiety , diverticulosis , hypercholesterolemia ,
and chronic dizziness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with history of coronary
artery disease and difficult to control hypertension who
presented with chest pain in the setting of the elevated blood
pressure and tachycardia. Two days prior to admission , the
patient had developed the abrupt onset of palpitation , chest
pain , diaphoresis , anxiety , and shortness of breath. She took
her blood pressure and this was found to be greater than 200 with
the rapid pulse. She called her PCP and was instructed to call
911. She was taken to the Ha Hstibrook Medical Center ED. Of
note , she had not taken her Toprol-XL for the prior three days.
In the emergency department , the systolic blood pressure was in
the 180s. This was controlled with her home medications and IV
Lopressor. The patient was ruled out for an MI in ED/OBS. She
went for a MIBI on the morning of admission , but this was
canceled because the patient was dizzy. Of note , the patient has
had an identical admission several months earlier for a labile
blood pressure. During that admission , the patient's hydralazine
and beta-blocker was titrated up with improved blood pressure
control. She was ruled out for pheochromocytoma and renal
artery stenosis. She did have elevated plasma metanephrines
during that admission. She was discharged at that point on an
improved antihypertensive regimen as described above. She also
reports having had a similar episode two weeks ago.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Hypertension , angina , osteoarthritis , GERD , diverticulosis ,
hyperlipidemia , coronary artery disease status post CABG x4 and
multiple stents , chronic dizziness , stable cath 8/4 .

ALLERGIES:
ACE inhibitor , amlodipine , and niacin.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
No smoking , no ethanol. She lives in West O Uxkan by herself , has a
helper ( visiting aid ). No family nearby. Her family lives in
Pit Forda Sta
FAMILY HISTORY:
Her brother died at 61 years old of CVA. Her mother died at 75
years old with CVA. Her sister had an MI at age 80.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Vital signs: Heart rate 98 , blood pressure 172/70 with a range
of 103-172/40-70. O2 saturation was 97% on room air. Her exam
was significant for tachycardia with a regular rate , normal S1
and S2 , and soft systolic ejection murmur at the right upper
sternal border. The remainder of the exam was unremarkable.
LABS ON ADMISSION:
CBC was within normal limits. Chem-7 was significant for BUN of
22 and creatinine of 103. Calcium was 10.5 , phosphorus was 2.5 ,
and albumin was 4.3. LFTs were normal. Her D-dimer was 1305.
She had two sets of negative cardiac enzymes. Coags were normal.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at the rate of 75 beats per minute ,
left axis deviation , LVH , left atrial enlargement. T-wave
flatting in lead III only.
STUDIES:
1. Chest x-ray ( 9/29/05 ): No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. PE CT ( 11/9/05 ): No PE.
3. Head CT ( 11/9/05 ): Left-sided meningiomas , unchanged from
2004.
4. MIBI ( 10/27/05 ): Area of reversible ischemia , unchanged from
2002.
CONSULTS:
Cardiology ( FMCO ): Luke Ollie Buckley .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Paroxysmal hypertension/tachycardia: This was in the setting
of not taking her Toprol. She does have a history of labile
blood pressure and difficult to control hypertension. This
symptom was thought to look very much like pheochromocytoma , but
this was ruled out last admission. Renal artery stenosis was
also ruled out last admission. Given the description and the
fact that she had elevated plasma metanephrines on the previous
admission , one possible diagnosis that was considered with pseudo
pheochromocytoma. Studies for pheochromocytoma , pseudo
pheochromocytoma , carcinoid , and hypothyroidism ( including
24-hour urine metanephrines were sent ) these all returned as
negative. Her TSH was normal. She was initially put on q.i.d.
Lopressor and hydralazine. The hydralazine was then discontinued
due to hypotension. Her Lopressor was changed to Toprol-XL , this
was also discontinued for hypotension. Her ultimate regimen was
titrated based on her blood pressures and eventually she was put
on Avapro 75 mg daily , atenolol 25 mg daily , and her home dose of
Imdur 120 mg daily. Her target blood pressures were 140s to 150s
and with this regimen , she was well controlled and asymptomatic
upon discharge.
2. Ischemia: She was initially ruled out for MI. Her MIBI
showed reversible ischemia unchanged from 2002 despite two
catheterizations in intervening time. She was seen by LMH
Cardiology , and this defect was felt to be nonintervenable. She
was discharged home in stable condition and chest pain free.
3. Dizziness/nausea: She had episodes of this during her
hospitalization. It was of unclear etiology and she has had a
previous significant prior workup ( see previous discharge
summary ). She received p.r.n. meclizine and Compazine and was
discharged home without any dizziness or nausea.
4. Calcium: She had borderline high calcium and a PTH was sent
and returned mildly elevated. This will need to be followed up
as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:
Stable.
TO DO PLAN:
Further workup for question of elevated PTH in the setting of
high calcium suggestive of hyperparathyroidism.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.
2. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. daily.
3. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Lasix 40 mg daily.
5. Ibuprofen 400 mg q.8h. p.r.n. pain.
6. Lactulose 30 mL p.o. q.i.d. p.r.n. constipation.
7. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. daily p.r.n. anxiety.
8. Meclizine 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. dizziness.
9. Nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingual every five minutes
x3 doses p.r.n. chest pain.
10. Compazine 10mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea.
11. Imdur 120 mg p.o. daily.
12. Avapro 25 mg p.o. daily.
13. Celexa 10 mg daily.
14. Nexium 20 mg p.o. daily.

88 year old man who comes in from rehab with ?hypothermia and rigors. 6
weeks ago the patient was diagnosed with osteomyelitis of the finger. He
had a PICC line placed and was discharged with IV abx. At the tail end of
his antibiotic regimen he spiked a fever and was admitted to VOWH .  His
course of antibiotics was extended and he was discharged to rehab on
ceftriaxone and vanc. Today at the nursing home he was observed to be
""shaking"" and the staff was concerned for rigors. However , the patient
says his hands were just quivering. At the time , his temp at rehab was 92
degrees. He was sent to the ED for evaluation.
In the ED , his temperature was normal. He was not complaining of further
chills or rigors. However , his EKG demonstrated new ST depressions in
V3-V5. The patient denied any CP/N/SOB/diaphoresis. His first set of
enzymes were negative. He was given aspirin.

cerebrovascular accident with resultant expressive aphasia ,
seizures after this cerebrovascular accident , chronically
ventilator dependent , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis as
a complication likely of gentamicin in July 2006 , history of
peripheral arterial disease with multiple toe amputations and
atrial fibrillation who was recently admitted at Ahooldi Health for an increasing BUN and creatinine ,
who was transferred from Ark Hospital Medical Center after she
developed an ulcer on her right lower extremity. At baseline ,
the patient is bed bound , but is alert , able to smile and
communicates by mouthing words occasionally. She developed a
right calf hematoma several weeks prior to this admission that
was incised and drained by the Surgical Service about one to two
weeks prior to admission. Since then she has had daily dressing
changes at her rehabilitation and at first her skin was noted to
be intact. On 10/13/06 , the patient had an increased temperature

metronidazole on 10/13/06 for possible treatment of
ventilator-assisted pneumonia and she had remained
hemodynamically stable. There was no note of increased
secretions or other problems with ventilation. On the day of
admission , the patient was on hemodialysis and a blister erupted
over her right calf wound , which revealed an underlying deep
ulcer down to the muscle. At that point , the patient's son

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
GI: The patient was admitted to the hospital for likely UGI bleed given
significant anemia , guaic positive maroon stools and elevated BUN. She
was transfused with 2 U PRBC initially , placed NPO , IVF and GI consult
was obtained. GI took her to endoscopy and did upper endoscopy on
morning of November .  They found a friable ulcer located at an anastomosis
site from her previous bypass surgery. No active bleeding and blood
vessels were identified at the area. This represents the likely source
of her bleed. 2 more units of blood were ordered to keep goal over 30
but she only bumped to 26.6 from 20 after total of four units initially.
It is possible the blood was drawn distal to where IVF was adminitered
and there could have a been a dilutional effect. One more unit was given
for a total of five which put her over 30. Her HCT was monitored and
stayed stable at 30 after that for the remainder of her hospitalization.
She was placed on BID PPI. Her asprin and plavix were held on admission
as well as her BP meds.
---
CV: She does have a history of CAD s/p MI and coronary stents. She
had a negative MiBi a month prior to admission. A set of enzymes upon
admission were negative , another troponin was negative on the
13 of June .  Her HTN meds were held upon admission. Her goal HCT is >30
given CAD. She is on digoxin for question of afib which was on
hold during admission. Cardiac telemetry revealed no events. She had one
episode of ""chest pain"" on the night of the 13 of June which was actually
located in the epigastric region. An EKG was performed at that time
which was unchanged from the admission EKG. She was HD stable without
event on telemetry. She received NTG tabs X3 without any relief and a
follow up troponin was negative for the third time.
---
PAIN: She was continued on current pain regimen.
---
PPX: Teds , Pneumoboots
---
ENDO: She was continued home Levothyroxine
---
GI: She was constipated during admission and had not had a bowel
movement despite very aggressive regimen. Her abd became slightly
distended. The patient then started to refuse bowel meds as she was
getting prepared for discharge and was afraid to have movement on ride
home. She agreed to maintain agressive regimen at home and was instructed
to follow up with PCP or ER if she can not produce results within a day.
---
She was stable for discharge on January and discharged with instructions
to follow up with PCP within two weeks or sooner if lightheadedness ,
bloody or black stools , vomiting , chest pain or other concerns.

-----------------------
events: 6/10 w/ transient LBBB
----------------------------------
hospital course: 60F with htn , afib presents with acute onset L sided
chest/back/shoulder pain , atypical for cardiac cp.
1. ischemia: It was felt that patient's chest pain was likely
musculoskeletal. It was worse with movement of her arms and chest and ws
reproducible with palapation. She was ruled out for MI with serial
enzymes and ekgs. We continued her asa , lowered her dose of bblocker
given bradycardia , and started the patient on an ace inhibitor. She
underwent ETT and went into rate related L bundle branch block. Full
report as follows: 1. Peak METS = 5.7 2. Duke Treadmill Score = +4
( Moderate risk: -10 to +4 ) 3. HR Recovery = 29
ASSESSMENT:1. Diagnosis: No evidence for ischemia at HR achieved.
Reduced sensitivity because ECG uninterpretable due to rate related LBBB.
2. Prognosis: Elevated prognostic risk based on low functional capacity
and a low Duke score of +4 ( Moderate risk: -10 to +4 ). 3.Arrhythmia:
Probable rate related LBBB at peak. 4. Hemodynamics: Normal exercise
hemodynamics.
Cardiology was consulted and they recommended a MIBI and echo to
better evaluate her cardiac function. She then underwent a MIBI which
showed a small inferior septaldefect , which was thought to likely be
artifact. Given the small area , it was felt medical management would be
the best approach. She was discharged on small dose of bblocker , ace
inhibitor asa and statin.
Pump: The patient's lasix had recently been increased to 60 mg bid. She
was not felt to be volume overloaded and was continued on this dose in
house. Her echo was done on the day of discharge and can be followed up
as an outpatient. Her blood pressures ran on the low side so she will
be discharged on a lower dose of her bblocker.
rhythm: Patient has underlying conduction system disease
with 1 degree av block and developed a left bundle branch block at a HR
of 150 during her ETT. She was continued on coumadin for h/o
afib
musculoskeletal pain: pain improved with standing tylenol and motrin
standing , with oxycodone for breakthrough
endocrine: Her fasting glucoses showed borderline glucose intolerance
with values around 110. These should be followed as an outpatient.
fen: low fat , low salt diet
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please follow up with you primary care provider. You did not have any
signs of significant heart disease. Please call your doctor if your
shortness of breath worsens , you develop new chest pressure , or you feel
lightheaded.
We have started a new medicine for your blood pressure and have lowered
the dose of your other blood pressure medicine.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:

f/u electrolytes on ace-inhibitor
consider PFTs to better evaluate reason for progressive shortness of
breath on exertion ( does not appear to be cardiac in cause )

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS IN THE DISTAL
RIGHT POPLITEAL VEIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 49-year-old former
triage nurse who has suffered from
degenerative joint disease since 1977 when she was hit by a Amasa Di Cison
bus. She was hospitalized at that time and had a left calf deep
venous thrombosis secondary to extended bedrest. Her joint disease
involved primarily the L4 to S1 vertebra ( comprising two joint
spaces , and she reported this to have been exacerbated by an
attempted rape in 1980. At present , the patient suffers
considerable daily pain inhibiting her ability to work. The
patient recently received a facet block in October of 1991 at the
Dukey Darnha Hospital by the Pain Service which only seemed
to increase her pain. She described steadily worsening pain in
recent months and an increased portion of her time is therefore now
spent at bedrest due to her decreased mobility. The patient
described first experiencing left calf pain one and a half weeks
prior to this admission which manifested itself as a crampy pain of
short duration. She apparently saw her private medical doctor at
this time , Dr. Denver Lehnen , who sent her out on nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs. On 4/12 , five days prior to admission ,
the patient awoke at night with severe right leg cramping. She , at
that time , went to the Mutes Hospital Emergency
Room where a noninvasive vascular study was positive for non
obstructive peroneal vein thrombosis. She was discharged on
Anaprox. On 4/29 , the patient returned to the DMC Emergency Room
complaining of increased pain and with great anxiety due to her
perceived risk of pulmonary embolus. The patient has had this
condition in the past and was quite concerned about it. Noninvasive
vascular studies at that time showed the lesion to be obstrutive in
the peroneal vein. However , there was no evidence of deep venous
thrombosis at that time. She was discharged on Coumadin , 5 mg q
day. On 8/18 , the patient experienced further worsening pain and
came to the Versteo University Medical Center for a second opinion. She
was heparinized in the Emergency Room and admitted to the Medical
Service. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denied chest pain ,
shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion , abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting , diarrhea or constipation , any recent weight loss or any
additional constitution of symptoms. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Occasional migraine headaches. L4-5 ruptured disc status post bus
accident in 1977. As stated above , she had a left lower extremity
deep venous thrombosis following that hospitalization. Previous
positive PPD , she had one year of treatment. Mugging in 1980 with
exacerbation of her joint disease. Emergency Room admission in 1988
for questionable cholecystitis. Facet block times two in 1986 and
1991. Periods of incremental menorrhagia. She is followed by Dr.
Ceo at the Warestar Medical Center .  Endometrial biopsy
recently performed was negative. Asthma. Gastritis. Appendectomy.
ALLERGIES: FISH. ERYTHROMYCIN. LACTOSE INTOLERANCE. FAMILY
HISTORY: The patient was raised by foster parents. She has some
knowledge of her natural parents. Her mother was retarded and died
of a pulmonary embolism. Her maternal grandmother had an
endochondroma. First cousin with pancreatic cancer. Maternal
grandmother had cancer of the cervix. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is
divorced times 11 years. She lives with her 16-year-old daughter.
She has a positive smoking history. She denied drinking. She
denied intravenous drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed a well developed ,
well nourished white woman in no acute
distress. The patient is mildly agitated and overly circumstantial
in her dialogue. Blood pressure 112/78. Pulse 100. Respiratory
rate is 24. Temperature 99.3. Skin was without lesions. HEENT
exam was within normal limits. Neck was supple without adenopathy.
She has a positive right anterior cervical mobile mass which
appeared to be a lipoma. She was without any jugular venous
distention. Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion. Breast
exam was refused. Cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm
with normal S1 and S2 without S3 , S4 or any rubs , murmur or gallop.
Abdomen revealed positive bowel sounds. Abdomen was soft ,
nondistended without any hepatosplenomegaly. The patient had
normal sphincter tone , no masses , guaiac negative. Extremities
revealed right calf tenderness to palpation , slightly swollen , no
warmth , positive Homan's sign. No cords were felt. The left calf
was unremarkable with some point tenderness and right inner thigh ,
again no cords felt. There was no CVA tenderness. There was
positive point tenderness in the region of L4-5 , L5-S1.
Neurological exam revealed the patient to be alert and oriented
times three. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact. No deficit of
sensory proprioception or position sense.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a sodium of 140. Potassium
of 4.3. Chloride 105. Bicarb of 30. BUN 25.
Creatinine 1.2. Glucose 89. CBC was notable for a white blood
cell count of 11.9 with 22 lymphocytes , 7 monocytes , 67
neutrophils , 2 eosinophils. Hematocrit was 41.4. Platelet count
150 , 000. PT was 16.6. PTT 29.8. All other values were within
normal limits. Urinalysis was significant for a pH of 8.0 , 1-3
white cells , 0-2 red cells , 1+ bacteria. Chest x-ray was
remarkable for no infiltrates or effusions , positive hiatal hernia.
EKG revealed sinus rhythm at 90 with intervals of 0.18/0.08/0.36 ,
no ST changes , no change since 11/23 .
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 49-year-old female with a
history of prior deep venous thrombosis with
recent decreased mobility who presented with a painful right calf
with a documented right peroneal vein obstruction. Although the
clot is only documented to be below the knee , the question of
progression must be addressed. Initially , in light of strong data
supporting these events , anti-coagulation to prevent progression of
these clots , the decision was made to further anti-coagulate the
patient as she had minimal risks for this procedure. On admission ,
there was no evidence of pulmonary embolus by history of physical.
Right calf pain/deep venous thrombosis: On the second hospital
day , the patient had noninvasive Doppler studies of her lower
extremity which were significant for deep venous thrombosis in the
distal right popliteal vein. There were no other abnormalities
seen in either lower extremity. The patient was initially treated
with heparin since her PT was subtherapeutic on admission and
continued on Coumadin. By the second hospital day , the patient was
therapeutically Coumadinized and the dose was adjusted accordingly
with the goal of 17 to 19. As far as her leg pain was concerned ,
the patient was treated with Percocet for this problem. Physical
therapy came and evaluated the patient and helped her with
regaining her mobility. She was fitted with compression stockings.
Arrangements were made for VNA for the patient upon discharge.
2 ) Back pain - This is a longstanding problem for which this
patient has been treated for for many years. She refused any
consultation at this time by the Carmau Comgarf Hospital Pain Service. Instead , we
treated her with Percocet for these symptoms. 3 ) Agitation -
Patient is extremely agitated demonstrating almost hypomanic state
with pressured speech and Flight of ideas. She was initially on
Clonipin on admission on which she was maintained. In addition ,
she was given additional benzodiazepines to help with sleep.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. Patient was
therapeutically anti-coagulated and she was given a
regimen of Coumadin to take to be followed by Dr. Garth Schoenborn .
Disposition is to home with visiting nurse service. DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 2.5 alternating with 5 mg q.d. , Clonazepam
0.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Percocet one tablet p.o. q.4-6h. , Darvocet l00
mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n. , Senokot 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. , and Cimetidine

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
PROBLEM LIST: 1 ) STATUS POST ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
2 ) PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSED 8/21 STATUS POST
RADIATION THERAPY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 69 year old man without
prior cardiac history. He had cardiac
risk factors including possible hypertension and possible history
of hypercholesterolemia. The patient had had a history of atypical
chest pain including cardiac work-up in the past with an echo in
1995 showing concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with
asymmetric septal hypertrophy. He had a normal ejection fraction
at this time. In 8/7 , he had an exercise tolerance test at which
time he went eight minutes with a maximal heart rate of 151 ,
maximum blood pressure of 226/90 , and no EKG changes. At 2 p.m. on
the day of admission , he developed substernal chest pain with
crushing tightness radiating to both shoulders and his jaw. He was
not short of breath. He experienced this pain on and off through
the afternoon although the pain was never completely gone. At 6
p.m. , he became acutely worse and at that time , called the EMT and
was brought to the Agund Hospital Emergency
Department. Within the Emergency Department , the patient was noted
to have ST elevations in the inferior leads. He was enrolled in
the TONSCHAPTECH MEDICAL CENTER trial. Infusion was begun at 8:15. The patient was
given Lopressor , oxygen , morphine , aspirin , and Heparin. He did
not drop his pressure with the sublingual nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Included prostate cancer in 8/21 status
post x-ray therapy as well as a possible
transient ischemic attack in 1990.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Zantac p.r.n.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was married with three children and he
denied any tobacco or alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission demonstrated a well appearing
black male in no acute distress. His vital
signs were a heart rate of 48 , blood pressure 83/30 in the
Emergency Department , and he was afebrile with oxygen saturation of
99% on two liters. HEENT: Examination showed oropharynx benign
and he had a left facial droop. NECK: Supple , 2+ carotids without
bruit , and jugular venous pressure was normal. CHEST: Clear to
auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Had a regular bradycardic rhythm
with a II/VI systolic ejection murmur. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender ,
and nondistended with positive normal bowel sounds and no
organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: Warm , well perfused , and no clubbing ,
cyanosis , or edema with trace distal pulses. NEUROLOGICAL: He was
alert and oriented times three , cranial nerves II-XII were grossly
intact except for a left facial droop , and motor and sensory were
grossly intact.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission showed a sodium of 144 ,
potassium 4.2 , chloride 108 , bicarbonate
22 , BUN 16 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 136 , white count was 8 with a
hematocrit of 35 , platelets were 239 , CK was 276 with an MB of 0.8 ,
troponin on admission was 0.0 , INR was 1.0 , and PTT was 22.6.
Patient's first EKG in the Emergency Department showed normal sinus
rhythm at 70 with first degree AV block , axis of 56 degrees , he had
ST elevations of 4 mm in leads III and aVF and 3 mm in II , and ST
depression of 0.5 to 3 mm in V2 through V5 , I , and aVL. Chest
x-ray did not show acute disease in the Emergency Department.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Within the Emergency Department , the patient
initially had resolution of his EKG changes but
had persistent jaw pain remaining at 10/25 .  He was taken to
catheterization which demonstrated a mid right coronary artery
lesion of approximately 95% with a clot but with TIMI 3 flow. No
intervention was done at that time. Patient initially required
vigorous intravenous hydration to maintain good blood pressure but
remained essentially stable and pain free. He had a drop in his
hematocrit from 35 on admission to 28 after his catheterization
secondary to blood loss at the right femoral triple-lumen site
placed in the Emergency Ward prior to TPA , blood loss at
catheterization , small hematoma , and dilution. He was given two
units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in his
hematocrit. The patient was then transferred to the floor where he
maintained his good course. He had no postcatheterization or
postmyocardial infarction chest pain. The decision was then made
to take the patient back to the catheterization laboratory to have
PTCA with stenting of his lesion and to see if it continued to
persist. The patient was taken on the day prior to discharge back
to the catheterization laboratory where he was successfully
angioplastied and stented. Immediately on returning to the floor ,
the patient did have a rigor postcatheterization but he remained
afebrile and did well over the remainder of his hospital course.
It was felt that the rigor was probably related to allergic
reaction to the dye as he was treated with Benadryl and steroids
without complication.
DISPOSITION: The patient will have visiting nurse services. He
will have blood drawn to check platelets in two days
as he had a fall in his platelet level to 60 after the
administration of the reapro. He will also need follow-up CBC in
two and four weeks because he is on ticlid.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , sublingual
nitroglycerin p.r.n. chest pain , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and
ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. to complete a two week course.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Marvin Snachez ,
cardiologist with EANH .  He will have echocardiogram
done on his first hospital visit. The patient will also follow-up
with Dr. Lorenzo Campoverde in the clinical trial center as follow-up for
his participation in the OERD HOSPITAL study.

Discharge Date: 5/28/1999
CHIEF COMPLAINT: This patient presented with an acute stroke and
was brought in by her daughter.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Sixty-six year old obese African
American woman of previous CVA of
unclear etiology and unclear clinical sequelae. She was driving as
a passenger in a car around 11:00 o'clock in the morning and
experienced a sudden speech arrest which was witnessed by her
daughter-in-law. She has also difficulty moving her right arm and
she had some tearing of her left eye as well as a skewed look on
her face. By 11:40 a.m. , the ambulance had arrived and she was
admitted to the Koote Hospital emergency department
where the protocol for acute stroke was instituted. The patient
had a CTA done which showed questionable luminal narrowing of the
distal left middle cerebral artery. CT scan was normal and the
patient was given intravenous TPA at 1323 p.m. She was given a 9
mg bolus dose over two minutes and 81 mg given over the following
hour. She was transferred to the neuro. intensive care unit of
Ham Tertnough Memorial Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY; Diet controlled diabetes , obesity ,
hypertension as per the Rinn Maield Pinessi Hospital internal
medicine associate records. She also has history of ulcerative
colitis and is on treatment. She is status post MI in 1988 and
there is question of an old stroke in the past. There is also
question of asthma.
MEDICATIONS: Currently is aspirin 325 mg and Asacol although she
wasn't sure of the dose.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Nonsmoker , married with several children. At
baseline , she is wheelchair dependent due to
chronic hip and back pain although she ambulates at home.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Revealed chronic mild shortness of breath.
FAMILY HISTORY: There was no significant other family history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION; Blood pressure is 138/76 , heart rate was 80
and paced. She was an obese lady lying on
her back. HEAD AND NECK: Revealed no evidence of trauma. There
were no bruits in the neck. CHEST: Clear. There were bilateral
wheezes. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Normal , obese
with no edema. NEURO: The patient is awake and alert , looking
around. She was mute however. She was able to follow one step
commands. She had a question of a right field compromise
difficulty crossing the midline. She had a right upper motor
neuron seventh weakness with decreased power on the right side of
the face. She had flaccid right arm. Her right leg had some power
with flexion at the knee but was generally weak. She had optimum
coordination and absent pinprick and proprioception on the right.
All of this was documented at 12:30 a.m. By 14;30 a.m. , after the
patient was given intravenous TPA , the patient's language had
returned completely to normal. She had normal speech including
comprehension and naming. Her ability to distinguish left from
right was intact. Her repetition was intact. SHe had full range of
movement of the eyes with full fields of confrontation. She had a
mild right arm drift on the right side but her strength was 4+/5
distally and proximally. There was normal power in the right lower
lobe and the plantars were normal. There was no increase in
reflexes. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit
for the neurological service of Teaspell Diee Hospital .
HOSPITAL COURSE: Blood pressure monitoring was instituted per
protocol , nasal oxygen was given and no antiplatelet
therapy was given for 24 hours. Head of bed was raised to 30
degrees. Head CT was repeated the following morning , the results
of which show that there is slight left basal ganglion internal
capsule , acute and subacute infarct in the left middle cerebral
artery distribution which was evolving from the previous study.
THere was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. The patient had
further investigations to look for a cause of this presumed embolic
stroke. She had an echocardiogram done which showed the aortic
root at 3.5 cm , the atrium at 3.2 which is slightly dilated. There
was normal ventricular size and overall preserved systolic
function , trace aortic insufficiency , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation ,
trace mitral regurgitation. Holter monitor was done which showed
persistent atrial flutter. The patient was coumadinized and some
discussion pertaining to cardioversion was entertained by the
electrophysiology service. However , this was not done as an
inpatient. The patient continued to do remarkably well after her
intravenous thrombolysis over the next couple of days. She had
persistent drift on the right arm; however , her speech remained
completely normal. SHe was reviewed by the chronic pain service on
several occasions for chronic back and leg pain. She reached
normal levels of Coumadin within several days and was discharged
without rehabilitation. She will be followed by the cardiac
service and a plan for complete cardioversion was instituted within
one month. The patient went home on Coumadin. She was finally
discharged on 5/11/99 .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 60 year old female with a history of breast cancer and
chemotherapy induced CMP( EF 20% , followed by CMP clinic; on 2 L O2 at
night ) , COPD , s/p DVT now anticoagulated , HTN , afib , DM , admitted
with presumed CHF flare. Ms. Guerena was recently admitted for
CHF flare and received intravenous diuresis. She reponded well and
was discharged at a dry weight of approximately 185 pounds. Ms.
Kimmell presented on this admission with 2 days of increasing SOB ,
abdominal discomfort , nausea and vomitting. She denied increasing
edema , change in number of pillows. She did endorse PND present but
states that it is unchanged. In ED , the patient was afebile , inital
ly with oxygen saturation in the high 90's on 2 L. BP 154/84. BNP was
greater than 3000. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Abdominal CT was
obtained due to concern for the patients abdominal pain and showed
an engorged , fatty liver , ascites , pleural effusions ( not seen
on CXR ). A surgical consult was obtained and the surgeons felt the
patients abdominal pain was not surgical in nature but rather secondary
to CHF.
Hospital Course:
1 ) Cardiovascular: a ) Pump- CHF exacerbation. We diuresed the patient
initially with intravenous lasix until her respiratory status
imroved and the patient was able to maintain good oxygen saturation on
room air. At the time of discharge her oxygen saturation on room air
was in the high 90's and was between 94-96 % with ambulation. We
continued the patient's home doses of beta blocker , angiotension
receptor blocker and statin. The patient was again encouraged to
adhere to a low-salt diet and weight herself daily. The patient will be
discharged on Torsemide 100 mg po q am and 50 mg po q pm , a regimine t
has worked will for the patient in the past. She will f/uw iht the
Naiimo Hospital CHF Clinic ( Harold Gohring ) on 5/6 at 10:30 am. The
patient will be followed by Rangespo Chica Li VNA who will assist in her CHF
monitoring and assess her for home PT. b ) Rhythm- The
pa tient is know to have frequent PVCs and non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia which was agian noted on this admission on telemetry.
She was asymptomatic with the NSVT and remains hemodynamically stable.
We obtained an electrophysiology consult to evaluate the need for an
AICD or biventricular pacing. The patietns electrolytes and magnesium
were monitored and rempleted and she was maintained on a beta blocker.
On 2/14 the EP service placed a VVI/R ICD device without complications.
It was interogated ont he day of d/c and the patietn was provided with
written instructions from the EP service for d/c. She will follow-up
with the Dr. Cradduck on 10/30 as described. c ) Ischemia:
Patient with a history of CAD.
ED initially concerned for a myocardial infarction. She was ruled o
ut for an MI with negative cardiac enzymes x 3. Serial EKG's
were unchanged. We continued the patient on ASA , beta blocker , s
tatin and ARB. 2 )Heme: Ms. Egerton has a history of DVT , therapeutic
on coumadin at the time of admission. We did decreased her
dose while being treated with levofloxacin. In addition her coumadin
was held for her EP procedure. At the time of d/c she will be
resuming her regular dose of coumadin and should follow-up at her
usualy JMC lab to have her INR checked on Thursday 5/6 .  3 )ID: +UA on
admission treated for three days with levofloxacin. ( Last day was
11/19/4 ). Her cx grew citrobacter which was sensitive to levo. Repeat
UA was negative. 4 ) GI: Abdominal discomfort presumably due
to hepatic congestion. Abdominal CT showed no acute surgical process.
Abdominal pain was resolved with diuresis. She does have a
chronic elevated alk phos which may be related to her
sarcoid. 6 )Endocrine: Continued
levoxyl for the patient's hypothyroid. Pt with IDDM. We decreased
her lantus dose from 50 u sc to 30 u sc on admission as po
intake was initially low. Pt can resume regular
insulin dose after discharge when she resumes her
outpatient eating habits. 7 ) General: PT consulted to assist in
prevention deconditioning while in the hospital. VNA will evaluate need
for home PT services.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Weight yourself daily , call your doctor when your weight increases
2. Follow-up with your Primary Care Physician in 2 weeks
3. Follow-up at the CHF clinic on Thursday 5/6 with Jeffry Vaudrain at
10:30am.
4.New Medication: ( Replaces lasix ) Torsemide 100 mg every morning and
100 mg po everynight.
5. Follow-up with Dr. Newsome ( 396 )540-2094 3/11 at 9:30 am for your ICD.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Keep appointments as outlined above.
2. Have your INR checked on Friday 5/6 .
3. Weight yourself daily. Call your PCP if your weight increases.
4. Follow written EP discharge instructions.
5. Fort VNA will resume services adn follow pt for CHF as well as

6. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
7. SILENT INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN
1990.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67 year old female
with multiple medical problems ,
including coronary artery disease , status post stent to the left
circumflex in 1999 , silent MI in 1990 , hypertension , type II
diabetes , and hypercholesterolemia , who presented to an outside
hospital with acute onset of shortness of breath that occurred
while the patient was watching T.V. This dyspnea was associated
with chest heaviness , but the patient denies nausea , diaphoresis ,
or radiation. The patient reports similar symptoms when she
presented in 4/5 to an outside hospitalization and was ultimately
stented for a left circumflex lesion. On the day of admit , the
patient was seen at the Odaughters Nyco Centspan Hospital , where she was
apparently in respiratory distress , and treated with oxygen ,
nitroglycerin , aspirin , Lasix , CPAP , and morphine. Chest x-ray , by
report , showed CHF. The patient improved with diuresis and was
admitted on a R/O protocol for flash pulmonary edema. Her
troponin-I and initial two CKs were flat. She was then transferred
here for cardiac cath , as cardiac ischemia was the suspected
culprit for her presentation. The patient states she sleeps with
one pillow. She has no PND or palpitations. She further denies
fevers , chills , constipation , nausea , vomiting , cough , bright red
blood per rectum , melena , or dysuria. The patient denies diet or
medicine indiscretion. The patient has had no further chest pain
or shortness of breath since the day she was admitted to the
outside hospital.

MCV 88 , RDW 13. PT 11.6 , INR 0.9 , PTT 25.1. Urinalysis showed 1+
protein , 3+ blood , 2+ leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 35-40
white cells , 80-85 red cells , 1+ bacteria , 1+ epi , no casts. EKG ,
on admission , showed a normal sinus rhythm at 70 , LVH with probable
strain laterally. No significant changes from an EKG done on
1/25/99 .  Of note , an EKG done at the outside hospital on 2/10
showed inverted Ts in I , L , and V2-V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to this hospital with a
recent episode of flash pulmonary edema. When
this had happened previously , cardiac catheterization had revealed
an occluded left circumflex lesion that was stented. There were ,
therefore , concerns that the patient may have re-occlusion either
of the stent or of one of her other vessels. Her metformin was
held. She was given pre-cath hydration fluids , and then she
underwent cardiac catheterization. The results of this study were
as follows: The patient had a 40% ostial LAD lesion and an 80% mid
D1 lesion , both of which showed no change from her prior
catheterization. The patient left circumflex stent was widely
patent. The patient's RCA was noted to be occluded and was filling
with collaterals from left to right. At the time of the
catheterization , the patient's renal arteries are also evaluated.
There was a question of an ostial left renal artery stenosis.
However , no other renal disease was noted.
Because the patient's catheterization was unchanged from a prior
study , it was unclear as to the significance of her D1 lesion. For
this reason , the patient underwent an ETT MIBI , the results of
which are as follows: The patient underwent a modified Bruce ,
heart rate of 66% of maximum predicted heart rate. She exercised
for 4 minutes 30 seconds and stopped secondary to dyspnea. She had
no new EKG changes and no chest pain. The MIBI portion of the test
showed a nontransmural anterior and inferior MI , with peri-infarct
ischemia involving 3-5 segments. At the time of this dictation , it
is felt that the patient's CAD is an unlikely explanation for her
presentation. Dr. Dibernardo will review the MIBI results and decide
whether a repeat catheterization with PCI is warranted. The most
likely explanation is that the patient has diastolic dysfunction
given her age and history of diabetes. Dr. Hake is interested in
enrolling her in a study that evaluates angiotensin receptor
blockers in treatment of this disorder.
The patient had an echo during this hospitalization. The left
ventricle is mildly dilated with an EF of 50%. The patient has
apical , septal , and lateral hypokinesis. Her right ventricle size
and function is normal. The patient also has a dilated left atrium
with mild mitral regurgitation.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow-up with her primary care
physician in two weeks and her primary
cardiologist in four weeks.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.
Please note that an addendum to this discharge summary will be
added with the patient's discharge medications.

---
Assessment and Plan: This is an 81 year old female with multiple
medical problems who presents with multiple vague complaints. She likely
has more than one medical issue going on simultaneously.
--
CV:
ISCHEMIA: Pt has known CAD. Worsening angina with exertion. No s/s
of ACS currently. EKG shows no ST segment elevations. Checked set of
cardiac enzymes which were negative. She was continued on asa , statin , BB
-
PUMP: The pt has history of diastolic heart failure. ECHO over one year
ago showed EF 55-60%. It also showed severe tricuspid regurgitation. Her
symptoms of DOE , fatigue , LE swelling , abd girth could also be explained
by Cor Pulmonale or worsening heart failure. A CXR was performed
which showed stable cardiomegaly and no signs of overt edema but
clinically with her elevated JVP , increased abd girth and LE edema
were suggestive of fluid overload. BNP was low at 122 but likely she was
somewhat overloaded. An ECHO was performed which showed elevated
pulm artery pressure of 45 , moderate tricuspid regurgitation , mild to
moderately enlarged R ventricle and moderately enlarged Right atrium. EF
of 60%. These findings are suggestive of potential cor pulmonale. Plan is
to diurese pt as outpt and repeat ECHO by PCP as outpt , then
consideration of cardiology referral. Lisinopril is added as allergy
( hyperkalemia ) , perhaps can be given as small dose with close monitoring.
Defer to PCP. The pt was placed on strict I/Os , daily weights. Avoided
fluid restriction given low BP for now.
-
RHYTHM: The pt has fatigue , dizziness , nausea raising the concern for
dig toxicity. She also has known afib. A digoxin level was checked and
came back at 1.4 which might be slightly high for her renal function ,
age and muscle mass. Her digoxin dose was therefore decreased to 0.125mg
daily. She was monitored on telemetry which showed frequent ventricular
pacing and occasional PVCs.
---
ORTHO: The pt had CT of cervical spine in October '07 for neck pain
radiating to the L , as is her current presentation. The CT showed DJD
but no fracture or other concerning finding. No recent trauma. Her pain
is likely from worsening DJD. Plan conservative intervention with
hotpacks , Tylenol. No further imaging indicated. Home PT planned.
---
NEURO: The pt has hx of CVA but current CTA shows no evidence of
acute CVA. Her Neuro exam is fairly unremarkable despite multiple
vague complaints of weakness , numbness , pain. She was continued on
asa. Neuro exam monitored without focal deficits. Treated headache with
Tylenol. If the pt's overall pain persists , she might benefit from pain
consult as outpt
---
PULM: Pt has no known pulm disease but has been prescribed albuterol
inhaler. If she in fact has pulm HTN , she may have causative pulm
etiology. CXR showed no acute pulm issues. If ECHO suggestive , PFTs as
outpt per PCP.
---
GI: Bowel regimen for constipation. PPI for GERD.
---
ENDO: Pt has IDDM. It is not exactly clear what she takes for insulin at
home because she reports that she only takes NPH once a day despite the
prescription in WBMC .  She is unclear on her doses or timing of insulin.
She was hypoglycemic upon admission. Check Hgb A1C--> 7.4. She was
started on Sliding scale Novolog and AM NPH for the time being. Monitored
FS which were reasonable. PCP to cont management.
---
FEN: Monitored fluid status. Monitored lytes. Avoided K scale while
on digoxin. Low fat , Low chol , NAS , carb controlled diet
---
PPX: Lovenox
CODE: Full
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. VNA to help with medication reconcilliation. VNA-please go through all
medication bottles in the house and sort out the current ones , help
patient make pill box with most current medications.
2. Digoxin dose has been lowered this admission from 0.25mg to 0.125mg
daily. Lasix has been increased temporarily to BID for diuresis until
follow up with PCP.
3. VNA to check sodium , potassium and digoxin level June .
4. VNA to check BP while on bid lasix. Hold dose if SBP <95 and call PCP.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Monitor fluid status/electrolytes. Repeat ECHO after diuresis. Consider
Cardiology consult for ?Cor Pulmonale.
Monitor renal function and digoxin level.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a 66 yo woman with a hx of CAD , emphysema , HTN , and DMII
who presents with a 2 month hx of progressive dyspnea on exertion who
was found to desat on ambulation today to the mid 80s. The patient had
a prior CABG in 1994 and underwent cath with additionally stenting in
2001. She had a recent MIBI ( 5/26 ) with nl EF and mild reversible
defects in peri-infarct territory. She had been doing well until
recently when she noted the onset of progressive dyspnea on exertion
over the last 2 months. She denies chest pain , cough , orthopnea. She
does report PND and new LE edema.
VS: 96.6 61 140/70 24 94 RA
PEx: Lungs: bilateral basilar crackles. CV: rrr , nl s1 and s2 , +s3 ,
II/VI SEM. Extr: bilateral edema over shins , non-pitting.
Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea: The differential diagnosis for this patient's dyspnea
includes cardiac and pulmonary causes. Based on physical exam it was
not felt that she was in heart failure. However , with hx of CAD , this
was investigated with Echo which showd nl EF and heart function. The
Echo also showed nl RV fxn and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
Chronic PE and lung parechymal diseases were investigated with chest CT
which was negative for PE. It also showed moderate to severe
centrilobular emphysema with no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis. She
had PFTs the day of admission which showed decreased lung volumes all
consistent with a restrictive lung pattern. Given the diagnostic
dilemma , the Pulmonary service was consulted , which did not feel that
doe was due solely to pulm etiologies. Thus , desat is unexplained. Pt
will be sent home on o2 to be used during exertion only.
2. CV: The patient has a hx of hypertension and is being followed by
her Cardiologist Dr. Stouch . Per Dr. Hehr recommendation , her norvasc
was discontinued as was her atenolol. Desats could be
due to transient diastolic dysfunction w/ exertion. She has been
started on labetalol 400 bid at the time of discharge. Titrate up as BP
tolerates
3. PULM: will be d/c'd on albuterol inh.
4. F/U: She is discharged to home with follow-up w/ urgent care next wk
for re-exam of BP , volume status and sats w/ ambulation. Titrate
labetalol as tolerated. If LE edema persists and pt continues to desat
w/ exertion , can try lasix. If DOE still persists , consider R/L heart
cath or cardiopulmonary exercise testing
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: if you have any worsening shortness of breath , call MD immediately.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Follow-up with Dr. Paasch on January as scheduled.
2. Call Dr. Fupocyupanqui to schedule follow-up.
3. Call doctors if symptoms worsen.
4. The following are med changes:
- stop norvasc
- stop atenolol
- start labetalol 200 mg twice a day

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
69 yo female with NIDDM , HTN , obese , former smoker admit two weeks ago
after discharge for positive stress test. In October , during
dobutamine part of MIBI pt had severe SOB with desat to 60s , ruled in
for NQWMI , refused cardiac cath or further evaluation. Pt now
readmitted with several days of nausea-like epigastric sensation
following meals , esp fatty/caffeine meals , decreased PO intake , then
on day PTA with profound nausea , diaphoresis and SOB while ambulating.
EXTREMELY difficult by history to differentiate cardiac vs GI etiology.
On examination only tachycardic , no signs failure. Plan was to treat
as cardiac disease , and evaluate for GI cause. Pt's lopressor was dose
adjusted for tachycarida , continued on ASA , ACE , nitrates. Pt not
anticoagulated. Cardiology consult felt new symptoms were GI and did
not recommend in-house cardiac catherization. Pt was started on
increased dose of prilosec for presumed gastritis with no evidence of
GIB by hct and heme negative stools. Presumed cause was home asa and
prednisone use. Pt will consider outpatient cardiac catherization and
intervention. She is scheduled to see Dr. Kallam in 2 weeks and Dr.
Drissel promptly after that.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please call your physician with any chest pain that is new , different
in quality , or if accompanied by shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting.
Please record the timing and nature of your symptoms if you continue to
have them. Also please record what makes them come and what makes them
go away.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 37 year old woman
with dilated cardiomyopathy admitted
with positional chest pain associated with viral prodrome. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY revealed the patient was diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy in 10-89. She was worked up at the Ingvid's Health Services with a conclusion of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ,
work-up unavailable. The patient was discharged on Lasix , digoxin
and an ACE inhibitor. In 15 of April , the patient was admitted to Orecross Medical Center after complaining of positional chest pain ,
shortness of breath and fatigue. She was diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy and received an echocardiogram , which revealed large
ventricles , 2+ mitral regurgitation , 3+ tricuspid regurgitation. In
23 of June , the patient underwent a bicycle exercise tolerance test and
endured 10 minutes and 16 seconds , limited by fatigue. Peak heart
rate was 104 , peak blood pressure was 156/80 , she had a few atrial
premature beats and no ischemic ST-T changes. Her oxygen uptake
was 16.2 milliliters per kilogram per minute. In 24 of November , the patient
underwent right ventriculogram which showed ejection fraction 24%
and global hypokinesis. On the day of admission , on 11 of January , the
patient complained of 4 days of diarrhea , nausea , vomiting and
malaise , followed by sharp severe chest pain in the mid chest below
the left breast radiating to the back , which was relieved by lying
on the left and aggravated by leaning forward or lying on the
right , also worsened by deep breathing and cough , and also with
ventral palpation. The patient claimed that the pain had never
gone away in the past 12 hours , but again was aggravated by certain
positions. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was significant for
cardiomyopathy , hypertension , gastritis , ex-intravenous drug abuser
for 10 years , anemia , and recent crack cocaine use. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION included Lasix , Enalapril and digoxin. ALLERGIES were no
known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese black woman in no
apparent distress. Blood pressure was
162/100 , heart rate 90 , respiratory rate 24 , oxygen saturation 99% ,
no pulsus. Eyes were pupils were equal , round , reactive to light ,
extraocular movements intact , muddy sclera. Neck was supple ,
jugular venous pressure was 8 to 10 centimeters , carotids were 2+
bilaterally. Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion
except for a few bibasilar crackles. Heart showed normal S1 and
S2 , no rubs , distant heart sounds , no murmurs were noted. Abdomen
was obese , soft , normal bowel sounds , she was comfortable with deep
palpation diffusely. Extremities showed no edema. Rectal
examination was guaiac negative. Neurologic examination was
nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium was 137 , potassium 2.7 , chloride
92 , bicarbonate 37 , blood urea nitrogen 7 ,
creatinine .9 , glucose 159 , AST 58 , creatinine phosphokinase 641 ,
with 23% myocardial bands. White count was 4.6 , hematocrit 31.5 ,
platelets 166 , 000 , ESR 60 , prothrombin time 11.3 , partial
thromboplastin time 18. Chest x-ray showed a big heart with mild
congestive heart failure. The electrocardiogram showed T-wave
inversions in I , II , F , L , V2 through V6 , consistent with a 1990
electrocardiogram done when she was complaining of positional chest
pain similar to the chest pain she is having now.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with the thought that
her history was consistent with pericarditis , but
was also worriesome for ischemia given her elevated creatinine
phosphokinase with myocardial band fraction of 23 , and her history
of cocaine abuse. Her hospital course was consistent with
continuation of her pain through the first day of hospitalization
despite and aggressive anti-ischemic regimen. It was found that
hermyocardial band electrophoresis showed no myocardial band
fraction detected , and it was decided that we would shift our
therapy to a more anti-inflammatory regimen to control her
pericarditis. At that time , Indocin was started and the chest pain
resolved. With the resolution of her chest pain , the T-wave
inversions corrected. The patient was transerred to the floor on
Indocin 50 milligrams 3 times a day , aspirin , Bactrim , Enalapril
and Carafate and remained without chest pain for the next 2 days.
She was also seen by the ACE team in consultation about her drug
and alcohol problem , and it was decided that she would be
discharged on 21 of January , after arrangement for follow-up with the ACE
team.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE included aspirin , Indocin 50 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , Enalapril 10 milligrams by mouth each day ,
Carafate 1 gram by mouth 4 times a day. The patient is to
FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Dewitt A. Sisler .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
HPI: Ms. Phetteplace is a 70 yo woman with h/o Cardiac Transplant 1992 , s/p
PCI/Stent 6/19 with 80% lesion LCx s/p R Carotid stent placement 6/19 ,
h/o DM , HTN , Hyperlipidemia , Smoking , now s/p L Carotid Stent Placement
10/24/06 .  During annual follow up in 9/30 of her heart transplant , a
complex eccentric 80% lesion was noted in the proximal LCx. She was
admitted in January electively with plans for cardiac cath/PCI/stent.
However in the interim period , she had a symptomatic LUE numbness thought
to be a TIA , concerning for R carotid stenosis.An MRI revealed bilateral
tight carotid stenosis. The LCx and Symptomatic R Carotid artery
underwent cath/stent placement in 6/19 .  However , intervention on her
left internal carotid artery ( though 90% occluded by cath ) was deferred
due to already receiving 2 angiographikc procedures during the 6/19
admission. At this time she was tapered off cell-cept and started on
rapamycin - in hopes of slowing progression in her coronary disease. She
then returned to medical attention on 19 of April for catheterization/stent
placement on Left Carotid Artery. During these procedure , a hematoma
developed at the L femoral access site which was managed with compression
during the case. FSBS was 384 prior to the procedure and elevated to 547
during the procedure ( she received D5W+HCO3 during the procedure. ) She
was given 10 u regular insulin x 2 and her FSBS declined to 400s. Her
post-procedure course has been complicated by hyperglycemia and hematoma
formation with a Hct drop of 30 ` 22.

1. Heme: Patient had r femoral hematoma due to bleeding around sheath and
causing fluctuation in Hct. HCT currently stable without transfusions.
Site non-pulsatile and no bruits. Transfusing 1 U pRBC 6/20 for goal
Hct>28.
2. CV( Ischemia ): Patient h/o ischemic CM s/p heart transplant with
evidence of CAD on allograft. Patient medically managed with pravachol ,
aspirin and plavix. Now s/p bilateral carotid stents and stent to LCx.
Attempt to change immunosuppressive regiments to rapamycin in order to
lower progression of CAD however on this regiment , her cholesterol panel
has markedly worsened. Have stopped rapamycin ( 6/20 ) and restarting
cellcept and cyclosporine at prior doses. Will need review in clinic in
30 days with bilateral carotid ultrasounds.
CV( Pump ): Clinically appears euvolemic. On Toprol , restarting lasix at
home dose ( 5/13 ).
CV( Rhythm ): On telemetry , no events seen.
3. Endo: During hospitalization and prior/during procedures has had poor
glucose controls with FSBS in 300s-400s. Patient reports poor glycemic
control at home with FSBS in 300s. AM FSBS was 384 and received D5NS
prior to procedure , exacerbating hyperglycemia. Endocrinconsulted and
recommended Qday lantus injection with with Novolog sliding scale + AC
while in house. HbA1c @ 11 ( markedly worse than 6 in January ) - patient can
not identify other factors which have changed since January other than
immunosuppressants to rapamycin. FSBS were difficult to control in house
despite using 20 QDay of lantus , Ms. Nickodem FSBS continued to run in
the 200s-300s during the day. She was taught to inject herself with
insulin SC during her stay. She is discharged on Glyburide 10 QDay and
Lantus 20 QDay. She was taught to keep a diary and will follow up with her
PCP.
4. Neuro: TIA/CVA in 6/19 .  residual Left numbness/weakness in hand. On
plavix and asa , now s/p R and L Carotid Stents.
5. Immunosuppression: As above , have changed immunosuppression from
Rapamycin + Cyclosporine back to Cyclosporine 75 BID +Cellcept 1000 BID as
patient performed priorto 6/19 .
6. MSK/Rheum: The patient previously complained of myalgias with statins and
was resistant to starting statins because they seemed to worsen her
aches/pains. Rheumatology service was consulted. They believed her pain
is not consistent with statin associated myalgia. Zetia was stopped and
she was started on Pravachol 20 mg QHS.
Her back pain is relieved by leaning forward and she walks at Arkansas
with a shopping cart for exercise which is consistent with spinal stenosis.
They recommended physical therapy and MRI imaging of her back. The MRI
preliminary read shows multilevel degenerative disc disease and moderate
spinal stenosis at one level. Physical therapy saw her and thought she
would benefit from home PT in the future--she was given a prescription for
outpatient physical therapy.
Since she is on long term prednisone she should have a DEXA scan and may
benefit from bisphosphonate therapy.

Discharge Date: 10/20/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
OTHER PROBLEMS: Diabetes , asthma , smoking , GI bleeding of unknown
etiology , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 71-year-old man with
coronary artery disease with risk
factors of diabetes , hypertension , cigarette smoking , and a report
of hypercholesterolemia. The patient has reported a history of
angina over the past several years which was well controlled by
nitroglycerin. In October of 1997 , he was able to exercise 3
minutes of the Bruce protocol with maximum heart rate of 79 and a
blood pressure of over 80 with no evidence of ischemia on EKG. An
echo at that time was also normal. About a month prior to
admission , the patient began experiencing progressive chest pain
which seemed related to exertion. He described the chest pain as
burning and radiating to his neck. The patient has a history of
gastroesophageal reflux , and was referred for EGD , but this test
was postponed until a further workup of the patient's chest pain.
At baseline he reports exercise-related chest pain everyday as well as
occasional chest pain at rest relieved by about 3-5 nitroglycerin. These
episodes are associated with diaphoresis , shortness of breath , but no nausea or
vomiting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
gastritis , GERD , GI bleed in February of
1999 , nephrolithiasis , diabetes , history of atrial fibrillation ,
asthma , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Cardizem , Klonopin , aspirin , Prilosec ,
Paxil , nitroglycerin , p.r.n. , Azmacort ,
albuterol , Mevacor , iron , NPH.
ALLERGIES: None known.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Afebrile , pulse 71 , blood pressure 107/53 ,
satting 97%on room air. Pertinent positive
include occasional bilateral wheezes on lung exam. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Regular rate , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
NECK: No evidence of JVD and no carotid bruits. ABDOMEN: Benign.
EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis , clubbing or edema , and dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibialis pulses were 2+ bilaterally. RECTAL:
Significant for guaiac-positive dark brown stool.
ADMISSION LABORATORY: Significant for hematocrit of 29.4 , with an
MCV of 78 , cardiac enzymes were negative on
admission.
EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 70. No
significant ST or T wave abnormalities.
PROCEDURES: Cardiac catheterization status post right coronary
artery stent was performed during the patient's
hospital stay. No complications resulted from this procedure.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular. On February , the patient had an exercise
treadmill test Bruce protocol. He exercised for 2 minutes and 30
seconds achieving a maximum heart rate of 104 with maximum blood
pressure of 130/90 , however , the test was terminated at low
exercise level for shortness of breath an leg fatigue. No EKG
changes were noted during this test. Since this test was nondiagnostic , the
patient was scheduled for a dobutamine MIBI. This test showed a significant
area of ischemia in the inferior and apical regions of the heart. An
echocardiogram performed also showed an area of hypokinesis in the inferior
region of the heart. Cardiac catheterization performed on February showed
100% occlusion of the LAD and 75% occlusion of the right coronary
artery with stent placement. Prior to stent placement , Mr. Niesborella
had two episodes of chest pain in the hospital which resolved with
nitroglycerin. He had no chest pain following stent placement. He also had
transient episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter.
2. Gastrointestinal. Mr. Tangerman was noted to guaiac positive on
admission. He also reported some symptoms consistent with
gastroesophageal reflux. While in inpatient , his Prilosec was
increased at 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. He was followed by GI while in
inpatient and it was recommended that he have a repeat EGD and
colonoscopy as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Gerald Leonardo Vasguez is a 56-year-old man
with a history significant for a coronary artery bypass grafting
approximately one month ago with mitral valve annuloplasty ,
diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented with a cough. The
patient had recently been evaluated on 9/21/99 for cough and was
treated for a pneumonia with levofloxacin.
The patient stated that his cough and malaise began approximately
one week after discharge postoperatively. He stated that his cough
was constant , worsened at night , with some small clear sputum.
Denied any hemoptysis or fevers. He also denied sick contacts. No
nausea and vomiting or diarrhea. The patient had also noted
increased leg swelling over the past several weeks. In addition
the patient was complaining of some orthopnea as well as PND.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Coronary artery disease , status post
coronary artery bypass grafting 4/5 ( left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , SVG to PDA , OM
[with mitral valve annuloplasty]. 2 ) Diabetes mellitus. 3 )
Hypertension.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Enteric coated aspirin , Zantac ,
Coumadin , Colace , Niferex , Vasotec and
NPH insulin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married , no alcohol , no smoking.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission. Temperature 97.9 , pulse 111 ,
blood pressure 133/86 , room air sat 96
percent. General - No acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal , round
and reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. Jugular
venous distention 15 centimeters , no lymphadenopathy. Lungs
decreased breath sounds at base with bilaterally crackles on the
left a third of the way up. Cardiovascular - tachycardic , normal
S1S2. Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended. Extremities 3+ lower
extremity edema to the mid thigh. Venous stasis changes on the
shins. Neuro nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , creatinine 1.2 ,
glucose 103 , WBC 5.5 , hematocrit 32.4 , platelets
37.6 , CK 113 , Troponin 1.03.
Chest x-ray - left-sided pleural effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Alexander Chadwick Rucker was admitted for increasing
cough , left lower extremity edema for presumed
congestive heart failure exacerbation. Hospital course by systems:
1 ) Cardiovascular. The patient was noted to be in new onset
congestive heart failure. He was aggressively diuresed. It was
noted on admission that patient was in atrial flutter with pacing
at a rate of approximately 110-120. An electrophysiology consult
was obtained and pacer was interrogated and mode changed to DDI
from DDD. The patient was loaded on digoxin and subsequently
spontaneously reverted to normal sinus rhythm.
2 ) Pulmonary. The patient was noted to have a persistent pleural
effusion that was new since the patient's coronary artery bypass
graft one month previous. Although it was suspected that this was
likely secondary to congestive heart failure or perhaps
postoperative pleural effusion , etiology was unclear. A pulmonary
consult was obtained. The patient did undergo a
diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis of 500 cc of fluid. Analysis
of the fluid showed a pH of 7.48 , total protein of 4.8 ( serum total
protein 7.6 ) , LDH of 158 ( serum LDH 228 ) ,
glucose 135 , amylase 33 with 600 white blood cells , 6 polys , 0
bands , 56 lymphs , 13 monos , 18 macrophages and 7 , 000 red blood
cells. No PMNs were noted. Cytology was still pending at the time
of discharge. Though the pleural effusion did meet criteria for an
exudate , this was difficult to interpret in light of the patient's
recent aggressive diuresis. As fluid did not appear to be
inspected. A PPD with control was planted which was negative ,
however controls were also anergic. Sputum cultures were negative.
It was felt that the patient would likely benefit from repeat
thoracentesis to remove enough fluid so that subsequently chest CT
could be performed. This was to be pursued as an outpatient.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on 7/27/99 with a home
VNA and physical therapy services for vital signs
monitoring and post coronary artery bypass graft rehab services.
FOLLOWUP: The patient was to follow up with Dr. Ladika on 3/5/99
in the chest diseases clinic , as well as with Dr.
Thayne , his outpatient cardiologist. He was also to be seen in
Coumadin clinic.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d.; digoxin
0.125 mg q.d.; Lasix 80 mg q.d.; NPH
insulin 20 units q. a.m. , 10 units q. p.m.; Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.;

DEATH SUMMARY
DATE OF DEATH:
5/23/06 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Zicherman was a 59-year-old who was admitted to Dalewan on 7/25/06 from an outside hospital with a
deteriorating ischemic cardiomyopathy. He had a myocardial infarction in 1996
and subsequently had coronary artery bypass grafting also in 1996 with
subsequent occlusion of two grafts. He had four previous stents in native
vessels , had a biventricular ICD placed in 2000 , and he also had a history of
hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
He was admitted with increasing signs and symptoms of heart failure and had
gone from class I failure to class IV over the 18 months prior to admission. He
was noted to have a BNP of 1600 and was being treated for pneumonia on
admission. He was initially evaluated for heart transplantation , but due to
clinical deterioration was considered for ventricular assist device. He
required inotropic support prior to surgery. There is no other surgical
history of note.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
As mentioned , also a history of mild polycythemia
and thrombocytopenia.
FAMILY / SOCIAL HISTORY:
Both parents had coronary artery bypass grafts. He had an
80-pack-year cigarette smoking history.
DRUG HISTORY:
At the time of assessment , he was receiving amiodarone 200 mg
three times a day , digoxin 0.125 mg once daily , aspirin 81 mg
once daily , heparin continuous infusion , Lasix continuous
infusion , dobutamine continuous infusion , milrinone continuous
infusion , spironolactone 25 mg once daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Examination revealed a midline sternotomy , respiratory crackles
bilaterally and a pansystolic murmur.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
On 6/16/06 , he underwent cardiac catheterization which showed
complete occlusion of OM2 , proximal RCA , proximal LAD , 90%
occlusion of the D1 , 100% occlusion of the ramus , 100% occlusion
of OM1. His LIMA to LAD graft was patent. He had a complete
occlusion of vein graft to RCA , 50% occlusion of vein graft to
D2. He was also noted to have pulmonary hypertension with mean
PA pressure of 48 mmHg and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of
33. His cardiac output was 3.5 liters on dobutamine and
milrinone infusions. Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction
of 15% , trivial AI , mild MR , moderate TR. EKG revealed atrial
flutter at a rate of 104. Chest x-ray was consistent with
congestive heart failure.
On 11/22/06 , he underwent reoperative insertion of a HeartMate left ventricular
assist device and tricuspid valvuloplasty. He was unable to tolerate
chest closure at the end of procedure as his central venous
pressure was high.
Postoperatively he was coagulopathic and inotrope and nitric oxide dependant.
On postoperative day #2 , some progress was made weaning inotropes and on
postoperative day #3 , he had a chest closure with a pericardial patch. He also
underwent exploratory laparotomy and sustained a VT arrest requiring
discontinuation of cardioversion. He continued to require nitric
oxide in view of high pulmonary vascular resistance. On 6/13/06 , he had a
further episodes of ventricular fibrillation and had multiple electrical
cardioversions and required amiodarone and epinephrine. Eventually , he
converted to AV paced rhythm. At this time , he required continued to require
significant inotropic support. He subsequently continued to have multiple
episodes of ventricular fibrillation which were converted with his AICD. At
this stage due to his ongoing hemodynamic instability , he was paralysed with
Nimbex , and his nitric oxide was increased for ongoing pulmonary hypertension.
He continued to be hemodynamically ustable. On postoperative day #5 ,
he developed cool and dusky extremities and was started on
bivalirudin although at this stage his HIT screen was negative. He also became
febrile with temperatures to 103. On postoperative days #6 , 7 and 8 , his PA
pressures slowly began to improve and some slow progress was made weaning his
epinephrine. At this stage , his bilirubin began to increase and he developed
some melanotic stool. He also developed renal failure and by
this stage , his creatinine increased to 2.9. By postoperative
day #9 , his Nimbex and fentanyl infusions were stopped. His PA
mean pressure had reduced to less than 30. He became febrile
fevers and developed some purulent discharge from the VAD driveline.
On postoperative day #12 , he underwent fluoroscopic placement of
a post-pyloric feeding tube and continued to spike temperatures.
His bilirubin continued to rise , and his ammonia level had also
risen. On postoperative day #14 , he continued to be unstable
with deteriorating liver function , ongoing renal failure ,
metabolic acidosis , ongoing fevers , hemodynamically instability
and episodes of ventricular tachycardia. He also had by this
stage developed irreversible loss of fingers and toes. Due to
his unrelenting and deteriorating multisystem organ failure , a
family meeting was held at which the poor prognosis was
discussed. The family elected to withdraw all support and on
5/23/06 , the AICD was switched off as was the ventilator and the
ventricular assist device and comfort measures were instituted.
Mr. Desilvo died at 7:30 p.m. on 5/23/06 from multiple organ
failure secondary to complications of ischemic cardiomyopathy and
placement of ventricular assist device.

dyspnea. At baseline can walk 4-5 blocks , over last couple weeks can
only walk about 1 block before becoming SOB. Was also getting SOB w/
minimal activity at home including showering. Sleeps on one pillow , no
orthopnea , no PND. Has had some pedal edema over the few weeks.
Increased urination and increased thirst , no reported change in diet.
Recently stopped HCTZ but no other change in meds. Also w/ some dull
chest pain over left side that radiates in a band like fashion across his
stenum to back , 3-4/10 in intensity , not brought on by activity , lasts
for seconds at a time when present , pleuritic. Reproducible w/
palpation. Pt had fallen on his right side several weeks earlier. Some
dull abdominal discomfort in lower quadrants usually improved with bowel
movements , last BM yesterday. No n/v. No calf tenderness , no recent
surgery , no recent travel. March wt 158lbs by records , pt has not
noticed any weight gain.
Pt reports not having this pain previously , however by records pt was
evaluated in 3/2/05 for similar atypical chest pains that was
ultimately a neg workup , with ECHO 4/9 w/ diastolic dysfn EF 60-65% , no
WMA , mod MR , mod TR , stress test 8/13 w/ no changes c/w ischemia on EKG
or ECHO ( but non-diagnositic due to peak HR 64 BP 140/66 ). He was seen
by Dr Decuir at that time who felt that ACS/ischemia was unlikely , and
that symptoms may have been 2/2 CHF and MR ( and his ECHO also showed new
AI at that time ) , and pt was apparently started on ACE at that time for
afterload reduction. He is not on an ACE right now and it is unclear
why. Further w/u of ischemia was suggested if the pt had persistent
symptoms but the symptoms seemed to have resolved by these notes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Kanady is a 47-year-old gentleman with history of
hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia who
presented to the Emergency Department on 4/18/02 with
substernal chest pressure , and ST depressions in V4 and V6 after
undergoing a stress test. He was in his usual state of health
until 1 month prior to admission when he started noticing a
burning in his chest while walking to work. This progressed to a
point where the pain was present with minimal exertion such as
moving a chair. The burning was relieved by rest. He saw his
primary care physician two days prior to admission who started
him on Atenolol and Nitroglycerin spray. The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization on 3/28/06 , which revealed right
coronary artery with a mid 90% stenosis and an ostial 60%
stenosis , a ramus coronary artery with a proximal 90% stenosis ,
left anterior descending coronary artery with a proximal 70%
stenosis , left circumflex coronary artery with a mid 50%
stenosis , first diagonal coronary artery with a proximal 50%
stenosis and a right dominant circulation. Echocardiogram
performed on 3/25/06 revealed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild
mitral insufficiency , and mild tricuspid insufficiency.

Significant for hypertension , history of transient ischemic
attack with visual field cuts in the left eye that lasted
approximately 30 minutes , now completely resolved ,
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , asthma in
childhood , history of thyroid nodule , obstructive sleep apnea ,
status post bilateral inguinal hernia repairs and appendectomy.

14.1 , PT/INR 1.1 , and PTT of 119.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Quesenberry was brought to the operating room on 7/12/06 where
he underwent an elective coronary artery bypass graft x5 with a
sequential graft right radial artery from the aorta to the right
coronary artery and then the first obtuse marginal coronary
artery and left internal mammary artery from the first diagonal
coronary artery and then the left anterior descending coronary
artery and a right radial graft to this left circumflex coronary
artery. Total bypass time was 200 minutes and total crossclamp
time was 145 minutes. The patient did well intraoperatively ,
came off bypass without incident. He was brought to the
Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm and stable condition.
Postoperatively , the patient did well. He was extubated and
transferred to the Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #2. He
initially had an inferolateral ST changes and a CK bump , which
did trend down at time of transfer to the Step-Down Unit. On
postoperative echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 55%
with no regional wall motion abnormalities. He was also started
on Motrin q. 6h. for postoperative pericarditis and the patient ,
otherwise , had an unremarkable postoperative course and was
cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day #5.
DISCHARGE LABS:
Are as follows , sodium 138 , potassium 4.1 , chloride of 104 , CO2
30 , BUN of 18 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 129 , and magnesium 1.9.
WBC 7.11 , hematocrit 30.4 , hemoglobin 10.2 , platelets of 225 , 000.
PT 15.3 , PT/INR of 1.2 , and PTT of 36.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Are as follows , Lipitor 80 mg daily , captopril 12.5 mg t.i.d. ,
diltiazem 30 mg t.i.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg daily ,
Lasix 40 mg daily for three days , glipizide 5 mg b.i.d. at 8:00
a.m. and 5 p.m. , Dilaudid 2 mg q. 4h. p.r.n. pain , Motrin 600 mg
q. 6h. for remaining five days , potassium chloride slow release
10 mEq daily for three days and Toprol-XL 100 mg q. day. The
patient was also enrolled in a study with ID ranolazine 1000 mg
b.i.d. , which he will remain or continue taking for 4 month
postoperatively and follow up with the study group.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS:
Mr. Karst will follow up with Dr. Laurence Chaumont in six weeks
and his cardiologist Dr. Byron Esterson .

Discharge Date: 1/29/2007
ATTENDING: LARR , ELVIS TED MD
PRINCIPAL ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Severe aortic stenosis and
congestive heart failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , Ms. Quist is an
81-year-old female with a known history of severe aortic stenosis
and multiple medical comorbidities who had been transferred from
an outside hospital to the Coronary Care Unit for
congestive heart failure likely related to overwhelming aortic
disease. She had previously declined aortic valve replacement in
the year prior to her admission. She had an echo performed at
outside hospital just prior to admission to Lumca Hospital showed an EF of 55-60% with severe aortic stenosis , an
aortic valve area of 0.6 cm square as well as 1+ mitral regurg
and 1-2+ tricuspid regurg. She was admitted to the medical
service at MH where she was aggressively diuresed. She was also
prepared for urgent aortic valve replacement and possible
coronary artery bypass grafting. At the time of her admission ,
her past medical history included hypertension , peripheral
vascular disease , history of stroke with left upper extremity
sensory loss , diabetes type 2 , hypothyroidism ,
hypercholesterolemia , renal failure with bilateral renal artery
stenosis , parkinsonianism , iron-deficiency anemia , vitamin B12
deficiency , obstructive sleep apnea , seizure disorder and colon
cancer status post resection in 1987. She is unable to elaborate
on the details of that resection. She also had renal artery
stenting in 2005.
ALLERGIES: Stated allergies at the time of admission included
Lipitor for which she had myalgias and an erythromycin with a
reaction of which was unknown.
MEDICATIONS: Her admission medications include labetolol 150
p.o. daily , amlodipine 5 mg p.o. daily , Isordil 30 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , Coumadin 5
p.o. daily , Lasix 60 mg twice a day , Colace 100 mg twice a day ,
iron sulfate 325 once a day , folic acid 1 mg p.o. once day ,
hydralazine 25 mg daily and Synthroid 88 mcg daily as well as
Dilantin 300 mg p.o. twice a day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , her physical
exam showed a woman 5 feet 1 inches tall , weighing 94 kilos in
obvious mild respiratory distress. Her temperature was 97 and heart
rate was 83 and sinus. Her blood pressure in the right arm was
120/63 , in the left arm was 109/53. She was on 5L of nasal
cannula while satting 99%. The remainder of her physical exam was
notable only for a loud holosystolic murmur at the right upper
sternal border and radiation to her both carotid arteries. Her
Allen's test showed severely dampened waveform in both left and
right radial arteries. Her chest sounded congested with rales
present bilaterally and her extremities showed 1-2+ bilateral
lower extremity edema. Her carotid , radial and femoral arteries
were all 2+ , but her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial were
present only by Doppler bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: Notable lab data at the time of admission
included a BUN and creatinine of 79 and 3.1 respectively and a
beta natriuretic peptide of 39 , 085. Cardiac catheterization performed on
9/10/06 showed 60% lesion of the ostial LAD as well as an 80% proximal LAD
lesion. She also had 90% ostial D1 and a 40% ostial OM1 lesion and right
dominant circulation. Her echo on 5/26/06 showed an ejection fraction of
60% , severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 60 mmHg and a
peak gradient of 99 mmHg. Again her calculated valve area is 0.6
cm square. Her chest x-ray on 5/26/06 was consistent with
congestive heart failure and appeared very fluid overloaded. She
was taken on 9/10/06 to the operating room where aortic valve
replacement with aortic root patch was performed , 21 Biocor
porcine graft was inserted. She also had a two-vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting using vein to her left anterior descending
and vein grafting to her D1 vessel. She tolerated the procedure
relatively well , but her ensuing ICU course was protracted and
very complicated and will be summarized systematically.
Neurologically , the patient suffered no acute complications
postoperatively; however , her state of consciousness waxed and
waned with her overall condition.
From a cardiovascular standpoint , the patient suffered a perioperative MI in
the late hours of 9/10/06 and on to the early hours of 5/17/06 .  She also
went into atrial fibrillation on postoperative day two and
suffered rhythm abnormalities for the remainder of her
postoperative course. Multiple conversion attempts were made
both pharmaceutically as well as with electrocardioversion , but
she occasionally did covert to normal sinus rhythm. Ultimately ,
she reverted back into atrial fibrillation. The third
postoperative day , she became hypotensive and asystolic. Chest
compressions were initiated for less than one minute at which
time atrial pacing was initiated and her rhythm was regained with
adequate blood pressure , though she was returned on to several
days of active drips to support her blood pressure. From this
point , Ms. Pavick developed dependence on pressors and inotropic
agents to support her blood pressure and cardiovascular system.
After several months with no real recovery of her cardiovascular
status , the family decided to withdraw care and put her on
comfort measures only. She ultimately suffered a cardiac arrest
on 1/16/07 .
From a pulmonary perspective , while she was extubated on the morning of
postoperative day #2 , she was ultimately reintubated and several pulmonary
complications required multiple bronchoscopies , multiple thoracentesis on both
chest for recurrent effusions and several chest tubes had to be placed for
aforementioned effusions. She was ultimately trached by the third
week and although she did occasionally come off the ventilator at
times , she never displayed adequate pulmonary function to be free
from vent dependence for any length of time.
From a GI perspective , with her trach , she underwent a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube for enteral feeds and at times needed to be
placed on total parenteral nutrition as she only occassionally tolerated
tube feeds. She did develop a Clostridium difficile infection
and had to be placed on long-term TPN until resolution of that
infection.
Her renal status at baseline was poor , though she was not on dialysis.
Postoperatively , she never recovered any meaningful renal function of her own.
She was placed on continuous venovenous hemodialysis by the third
week ultimately became anuric , requiring triweekly hemodialysis on Monday ,
Wednesday and Friday , a schedule she was managed on until the time of her
death.
From an ID standpoint , she developed many bacteremias and GI
infections as previously discussed. The Infectious Disease Team
was involved in her care and there recommendations were followed
throughout her hospitalization. For the greater duration of her
ICU course , she was maintained on vancomycin , levofloxacin and
Flagyl on and off for multiple infections.
From an endocrine standpoint , she was maintained on her Synthroid dosing and
was on a CZI drip for blood sugar control throughout her ICU course.
Hematologically , the patient was transfused many many blood
products over the course of her ICU stay. She also developed
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and subsequent clots to her left
lower extremity requiring vascular surgery intervention. She had
embolectomy and thrombectomy of her left common femoral artery as
well as a left common femoral endarterectomy with patch
angioplasty on 3/13/06 .  She was maintained on bivalirudin and
Coumadin throughout her ICU course.
Given her preoperative status and multiple medical comorbidities as well as her
overall poor prognosis through many postsurgical complications , a family
meeting on 10/12/07 resulted in decision to withdraw support and provide
comfort measures only. At that time , tube feeds were stopped , hemodialysis was
stopped
and the patient was made comfortable with morphine until her
ultimate cardiac arrest at 0235 am on 1/16/07 .

ATTENDING: SPILIAKOS , JODY DOMENIC MD
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Acute renal failure.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Acute on chronic renal failure.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Deglopper is a 63-year-old
male , stage III CHF and extensive past medical history notable
for hypertension , insulin-dependent diabetes and an MI , status
post CABG in 1989 and an unsuccessful catheterization in October
2005 , who presented following three days of oliguria. The
patient stated that for the last seven weeks , he has been
travelling on vocation , while he was awake , he noted decreased
dosages of many of his medicines specifically , he reduced his own
Lasix dose from 480 mg daily to 180 mg b.i.d. He also reduced
his Lotrel by half from 10 mg/40 mg to 5 mg/20 mg. He is also
taking Humalog 10 units , Lantus 45 units and Humulin 5 units. He
stated that his glucose levels were well controlled with blood
sugars less than 140. The patient reports that while he was
away , he felt as good as he has ever felt , was able to walk
greater than longer distances and over all felt much stronger.
However , he states that on Thursday night , he noticed that
instead of urinating as normal of 4-5 times per night , he was
found to only urinate 2-3 times. He did not urinate at all on
subsequent days and then put out merely a point of urine on the
day prior to admission. He reported that his urinary stream was
not the usual strength. He did not report dysuria or sensation
of being incomplete voiding. In addition , he noted that his
weight usually fluctuated approximately 4-6 pounds per day , but
that he had gained approximately 12 pounds since his oliguria
presented. He notes that his legs are swollen more than usual
and he denies chest pain , palpitations , or shortness or breath.
MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's medical history is notable for
CAD , status post CABG , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , CHF ,
obstructive sleep apnea , insulin-dependent diabetes and a hiatal
hernia.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission , his vital signs were
stable with a temperature of 95.8 , heart rate of 60 , blood
pressure 90/50 and saturating 99% on room air. The patient was
an obese male. He was normocephalic and atraumatic with equal ,
round and reactive pupils. His hearing and vision were grossly
intact. His neck exam was significant for JVD of 8 cm. He had
no carotid bruits. His pulmonary exam was clear to auscultation
bilaterally. He had a normal PMI. No right ventricular heave.
His rate and rhythm were normal. He had a normal S1 and S2.
Midsystolic and holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex 3 out
of 6. His abdomen was notable for multiple abdominal scars and a
large abdominal hernia. He had positive bowel sounds. His
abdomen was soft and nontender. His extremities were significant
for 1-2+ pitting edema to ankles. There was no erythema , warmth ,
or calf tenderness. His neurologic exam was nonfocal.
His significant labs on admission was hyponatremia , sodium of 130
and potassium of 2.9. A creatinine of 3.0 , BUN of 99 and a
glucose of 80. His white cells were 9.7. His hematocrit was
36.0. His platelet count was 212 , 000. His UA was negative. His
renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis. No obstruction and a
left renal cyst. His chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly. No
effusions or no evidence of pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Renal. The patient's presentation consistent with acute on
chronic renal failure , which was attributed to low-effective
arterial blood volume and extensive cardiac history notable for
diastolic heart failure in addition to hypertension ,
atherosclerosis , most likely contributed to his chronic kidney
disease with a baseline creatinine in October 2005 of 1.6. He
was initially aggressively treated with diuresis with IV
furosemide on admission. His ACE inhibitor was held due to
increased renal perfusion. His urine output increased over his
initial two days of admission and his weight decreased from 261
pounds upon admission to 254 pounds , three days later. His
baseline weight prior to this episode of oliguria was 249 pounds.
His diurese were held per recommendations of the renal consult
team in order to allow for further decrease in his creatinine
before he was given them again. He continued diurese and began
his ACE inhibitor therapy prior to discharge.
Cardiovascular: During his hospital stay , Mr. Sperandio
experienced multiple episodes of his typical anginal symptoms as
well as a more pronounced episode of 10 out of 10 chest pain on
hospital day #3. During each event , the patient was noted to
have no significant EKG changes and his cardiac enzymes were
always negative. He underwent an echocardiographic exam during
this admission , which was essentially unchanged from his previous
echo on October of 2005. His ejection fraction had increased in
fact to 75%. There was minimal left ventricular hypertrophy. He
was continued on his regimen of isosorbide mononitrate 240 mg
p.o. q.a.m. , which actually was changed from 240 mg q.a.m. to 120
mg b.i.d. for more continuous coverage. He also received his
home regimen of aspirin , statins , Plavix and was started on
heparin for prophylaxis. In addition , his magnesium and
potassium were repleted as necessary. The patient continued his
home regimen of Lantus , Humalog and Regular Insulin by
fingersticks and then self-administering what he needed to
coverage levels. He continued his Synthroid for hypothyroidism
and his TSH was within normal limits during this admission. The
patient's discharge medications included aspirin 325 mg p.o.
daily , allopurinol 100 mg p.o. daily , Regular Insulin sliding
scale , which he self-administers , levothyroxine , sodium 50 mcg
p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 100 mg b.i.d. , Humalog sliding scale , which
he administers to himself daily , Plavix 75 mg , p.o. daily , Lantus
45 units subcu q.p.m. , Lasix 160 mg p.o. daily , nitroglycerine
sublinguals p.r.n. for chest pain and Lotrel 5/20 mg p.o. daily ,
Imdur 240 mg p.o. daily and Lipitor 40 mg p.o. daily. The
patient was discharged to home with followup appointment with Dr.
Stoss in 1-2 weeks.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.

SUMMARY: This is a 42-year-old morbidly obese female with a
history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
complicated by BKA on two prior occasions , who was admitted to the
MICU with a BKA in the setting of urosepsis and a non-Q-wave MI.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Her hospital course by systems is as follows:
1. ENDOCRINE: As noted above , the patient
presented with BKA in the setting of urosepsis and a non-Q-wave MI.
She was placed on an insulin drip and hydrated with intravenous
fluids , with improvement. She was eventually transitioned to NPH
with insulin sliding scale coverage. Despite escalating her dose
of NPH up to 65 U subcu b.i.d. on the day of discharge , she
continued to have elevated blood sugars >200 and required coverage
with insulin sliding scale. This issue will need to be addressed
as an outpatient.
2. PULMONARY: Posthydration , the patient was noted to have
increasing respiratory rates and O2 requirements and rales on exam.
As her creatinine had improved concurrent with hydration , she was
gently diuresed. An echocardiogram was obtained to assess her left
ventricular function in the context of her non-Q-wave MI , which was
notable for normal left ventricular function , with an EF of 50% ,
hypokinesis of the inferior septum , a right ventricle that was
mildly enlarged , with mildly decreased systolic function , normal
aortic valve , mild TR , and mild MR , and a pulmonary artery pressure
of 39 mm of mercury plus right atrial pressure consistent with
pulmonary hypertension and no pericardial effusion. With her body
habitus putting her at risk for DVT and PE , an echocardiogram which
showed evidence of pulmonary hypertension raised the concern for PE
being responsible for her symptoms of tachypnea and tachycardia. A
spiral CT was obtained that was nondiagnostic secondary to her body
habitus. A VQ scan was obtained , which was read as low probability
for PE. In addition , she also had negative LENIs. These studies
taken together alleviated the concern of PE or DVT in her. It was
felt that the patient likely had obstructive sleep apnea secondary
to her body habitus. She was maintained on CPAP during her
hospitalization stay; however , the patient informed the treating
team that she would not be using a CPAP machine once she returned
home secondary to the inconvenience and discomfort.
3. ID: On admission to MICU , given her positive urinalysis , she
was placed on cefotaxime for gram negative coverage. Both her
blood cultures and urine cultures grew out E. coli which were
sensitive to cefotaxime and gentamycin. As she initially continued
to be febrile and continued to have positive blood cultures , one
dose of gentamycin was given for synergy. Subsequently , she
improved. She remains on IV cefotaxime for the 7-day period that
she was in the MICU. On transfer to the floor , she was switched to
p.o. levofloxacin and will take 7 days of p.o. levofloxacin to
complete a total 14-day course of antibiotics for urosepsis.
4. CARDIOVASCULAR: Patient ruled in for a non-Q-wave MI by EKG
and enzymes. Her peak CK was 1200 , with a troponin of 1.52. She
was initially placed on aspirin , heparin , and a beta blocker. Once
her creatinine normalized , an ACE inhibitor was also added.
Heparin was discontinued once the concern for PE was alleviated.
Her beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were titrated up for a goal
systolic blood pressure of <140 and a pulse of <70. She was
transferred to the floor on hospital day 7 , where she remained
stable. Another guanosine MIBI was obtained , as the patient
reported that she would be unable to exercise , given her chronic
low back pain and sciatica. A planar study was done secondary to
her body habitus , which revealed a moderate sized area of prior
myocardial infarction throughout the mid LAD coronary territory ,
with moderate residual peri-infarct ischemia. The Cardiology
Service did not feel that the degree of this lesion warranted
catheterization , given the sizable risk of catheterization in her.
5. RENAL: On presentation , the patient had a creatinine of 2.1 ,
up from her baseline of 1.4. She was felt to have acute renal
failure , secondary dehydration , in the setting of diabetic
ketoacidosis. She was rehydrated and concurrent with this her
creatinine returned to her baseline and remained stable thereafter.
6. GI: On admission to the MICU , the patient was placed on GI
prophylaxis with Carafate. Once she was tolerating p.o.'s , she was
placed on an ADA diet and her Carafate was discontinued prior to
discharge. Once transferred to the floor , the patient complained
of diarrhea; however , the nurses did not witness and were unable to
obtain a stool sample to check for C. diff toxin. Patient was
treated symptomatically with Imodium p.r.n. diarrhea. Prior to
discharge , the patient was counseled by the Nutrition Service
regarding an appropriate diabetic and coronary artery disease diet.
7. PAIN: On admission , the patient was on several pain medicines ,
including amitriptyline , Flexeril , and Valium for reported history
of sciatica and low back pain. On this hospitalization , these
medications were discontinued and she was placed on Neurontin for
likely diabetic neuropathy.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
NPH Humulin insulin 65 U subcu b.i.d. ,
human insulin sliding scale: for blood sugars 151-200 give 4 U ,

mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISPOSITION: Prior to discharge , the patient was evaluated by the
physical therapist , who noted her to walk around the
hospital Eldsche St , Lake Corp Ver , Alaska 29176 without significant problems. They felt that she
would be safe to discharge to home and did not need home PT , but
agreed that she would benefit from cardiac rehab , for which she was
referred. Patient was discharged to home on hospital day 9 , with
VNA , who will monitor her blood pressure , pulse , and blood sugar ,
and contact her PCP with any concerns or questions. She will
follow up with her PCP , Dr. Carmine Guillebeau , at WNDH in one week's
time , and she will follow up with Dr. Sammie Derobertis of cardiology
at Gons Landgilesnyton Dralvail in April .

ATTENDING: BRADLEY FRIEDRICHSEN M.D.
DIAGNOSIS: Left calcaneus osteomyelitis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Kubly is a 61-year-old
gentleman with type II diabetes , coronary artery disease ,
peripheral neuropathy and hypertension who presents for
evaluation of a longstanding left heel ulcer and presumed
calcaneus osteomyelitis. He also has had multiple surgeries in
the past as well as hyperbaric oxygen and has been refractory to
these treatments. He has had a recent flare in 3/16 and has
been treated at Eltham Medical Center .  At that time the wound grew
out methicillin resistant staph aureus and e. coli. These
organisms have been treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn. However ,
an MRI at that time was thought to be consistent with
osteomyelitis. The patient presented for treatment of this
issue.
Additionally , the patient has had some left shoulder pain and was
admitted at Otjo Goldtion Hospital on 1/26/2003 . There was concern for
sepsis at the sternoclavicular joint or perhaps at the
glenohumeral joint. The patient had an MRI at the outside
hospital which is not available to us but was concerning for some
abnormal process at the sternoclavicular joint. The patient
states he still has some shoulder pain that localizes to the
sternoclavicular joint. This seems to be improving over time.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left heel ulcer and calcaneal
osteomyelitis , BPH status post TURP in 1984 , insulin diabetes
mellitus , hypertension , coronary artery disease status post an MI
in 1991 , cataracts.
ALLERGIES: To codeine.
MEDICATIONS: The patient takes insulin NPH 40 q.a.m. and 30
q.p.m. , Humalog 20 in the morning 60 at night , Norvasc 5 once a
day , Allopril ( sp? ) 40 once a day , Prilosec 20 once a day , K-Dur
10 once a day , Lasix 40 once a day , enteric coated aspirin 80
once a day , Protonix 40 once a day , Reglan 5 twice a day , Xanax
0.25 q.h.s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs on admission are
stable with a temperature of 98.4. A pleasant gentleman. Clear
lungs. Heart regular rhythm. Abdomen soft and nontender. Left
heel has a 1.5 cm ulcer on the posterior aspect that appears to
tract deep to bone. He has generalized decreased neuropathy in
the foot and minimal EHL or FHL. He has 5/5 _____ with limited
range of motion at the ankle.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION: White count of 6 , hematocrit of
30 , sed rate of 111.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital for
evaluation and treatment of his calcaneous osteomyelitis. An MRI
was obtained which was read with a bone radiologist and
consistent with osteomyelitis. The patient was taken for
debridement to the operating room , after preoperative clearance
by the medicine team , for debridement of calcaneal osteomyelitis
on 7/6/2003 ( see _____ of the procedure ). Postoperatively the
patient was continued on Vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl per
the infectious disease recommendations. The cultures from the
primary debridement ( in which the wound was able to be closed )
was methicillin resistant staph aureus.
The patient did well inhouse. His wound to the foot was changed
while inhouse and looked intact , clean and dry without drainage.
The drain was removed on postoperative day #4.
Regarding the patient's left sternoclavicular joint , CT scan was
obtained which was concerning for infection at the
sternoclavicular joint. An MRI was obtained to better image the
area and to determine whether or not there is some involvement of
the clavicle. On the CT scan there was no obvious collection
amenable to surgical decompression. At the time of this
dictation the MRI was pending.
The patient had also had a preoperative consult with the Plastic
Surgery team but this was not necessary at the patient's wound
was able to be closed in the OR. Additionally , vascular studies
were obtained which were read as excellent PVRs preoperatively.
FOLLOW UP: The patient will follow up with the Infectious
Disease team as well as primary care physician as well as
Orthopedic Surgery team and Dr. Talburt one week after discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Per the ID record , Vancomycin 1 gram
q.24h as well as gatifloxacin 200 mg once a day. The patient
will continue his home medicines.
LABS: Labs will be checked once per week by the primary care
physician.
WEIGHTBEARING: The patient will be tested on weightbearing of
the left lower extremity.

1 )C/V
+I- Pt was R/OMI'ed with all three sets negative for ischemia. This was
to examine for causes of CHF exacerbation. Pt was continued on her home
rx of betablocker , asa , statin
+P- Pt normotensive. Likely fluid
overloaded given CXR , physical exam , and HPI. Pt was diuresed with IV
Lasix in the ED. On the floor she received 2.5mg of Metolazone followed
by 60mg of Torsemide. She was then diuresed with 5mg of Metolazone
followed by 120mg of Torsemide. She was roughly negative 1.3L. Pt was
doing clinically well when on 4/23 pt's Cr increased to 3.2 from her
baseline of about 2.5. At that time Torsemide and Metolazone were held.
Pt's daily weights continued to decrease even off of diuretics. On 3/4 ,
however pt's weight increased to 72.9 kg from 70.6kg. At this time pt was
restarted on her home rx of torsemide 20mg po bid. A repeat weight was
checked in the pm returning as 71.7kg. Pt was discharged on 3/4 at a
weight of 158 lbs.
of discharge pt was at or better than her baseline function in terms of
her orthopnea/SOB.
+R- During her stay the patient remained in afib with good rate control
on her bblocker.
2 ) Heme: Pt was found to be supertheraputic during her stay. Her coumadin
was held throughout her admission as her INR remained 3.9 to 4.0 in the
setting of hemoptysis. On
discharge pt was started on 1/2 her home coumadin with VNA/PCP f/u in 2
days. Pt d/ced on Coumadin 1mg qpm.
3 ) ID- Pt had a negative UA and urine CTX. However during her admission pt
developed diarrhea. Because of concern for c.diff colitis. Pt recieved an
abdominal CT. CT showed no colitis but did show a LLL consolidation likely
PNA. Pt was initially treated with azithromycin but as her cough and o2
requirement did not improve , as well as because pt began to spike fevers ,
pt was begun on ceftaz and levo for gram pos coverage ( levo ) double gram
neg coverage , and atypical coverage ( levo ) for presumed hospital aquired
PNA in the setting of pt's multiple hosp for CHF exacerbation this year.
PT improved clinically and was d/ced on levofloxacin 500mg q48h x 7 days
and ceftaz changed to cefpodoxime 200mg po qd x 7 days.
Pt's diarrhea was concerning for c.diff given fever and high whitecount.
however pt had only been on azithromycin x 1 day. Cdiff , fecal leuks , and
all stool studies were negative during admission. Presumed viral
gastroenteritis. Pt started on loperamide before discharge to be continued
prn diarrhea.
4 ) Endocrine - Pt's po DM rx were held during her admission - she was
covered with Lantus and Insulin Asp SS. HgA1c was sent and was in nl
range. Home po rx were restarted on
discharge. Pt was kept on her home dose of levoxyl; TSH was rechecked
and within nl range. Pt's home rx Allopurinol was also continued.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: ZOGG , RAYMOND RANDALL MD
DISCHARGE DATE:
Presumed to be 10/9/05 .
PRIMARY ONCOLOGIST:
Antoine Petchulis , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Pain secondary to a lytic lesion in the right hip.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
Recurrent lymphoma , pulmonary dysfunction secondary to
chemotherapy and obesity.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
In brief , this is a 57-year-old female with follicular lymphoma
diagnosed approximately eight years ago who has been treated in
the past with CVP and CHOP/Rituxan. She underwent high-dose
chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue in 6/22 .  Her
transplant was complicated by worsening of her baseline impaired
lung function , and she has been oxygen dependent since the time
of transplant. In 4/9 , she began to have back pain and
eventually was shown to have recurrent or increasing disease in
the retroperitoneum by abdominal CT ( paraaortic at the level of
L2 ). The decision was made to pursue radiation therapy to this
area , which she completed on 10/4/05 . The patient presented
with complaints of pain in the mid lower back radiating in a
band-like distribution around the waist to the abdomen as well as
into the right hip and buttock area. The pain also radiated into
the right thigh with movement for weightbearing. The patient
reports the pain was occasionally associated with numbness in the
right lateral thigh. She denied any radiation of the pain to
below the knee. She denied any numbness in the lower legs , back
or saddle area. She denied any change in bowel or bladder
function.
The patient had fluoroscopic LP on 6/18/05 with a glucose of 69 ,
a total protein of 49.3 , and cytology which was negative. Plain
films of her hip showed enthesopathy of the superior pelvis
bilaterally , lower lumbar spine degeneration , and sclerotic focus
in the proximal region of the right femur. MRI of the lumbar
spine on 8/5/05 showed an irregular soft tissue mass within the
retroperitoneum centered anterior to the spine at the level of
L2 , position posterior to the IVC and right lateral aorta
measuring 4.5 x 2.7 x 3.4 cm; there is a lesion involving the
anterior superior aspect to the L2 vertebral body continuous with
the anterior paraspinal mass with wedging and probable pathologic
compression fracture. No epidural mass.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Recurrent lymphoma.
2. Pulmonary function thought to be due in part to BCNU
chemotherapy , currently on 5 liters home O2.
3. Status post cholecystectomy.
4. Obesity.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:
Vitals: Temperature 97.6 , heart rate 91 , blood pressure 140/90 ,
respiratory rate 22 , oxygen saturation 97% on 5 liters. In
general , the patient was found to be alert and oriented x3 with
difficulty standing secondary to pain and habitus. HEENT:
Pupils were equally round and reactive to light. Normal sclerae ,
normal conjunctivae. Extraocular movements were intact. Moist
mucous membranes and clear oropharynx. Neck: No
lymphadenopathy , no thyromegaly. Pulmonary: Clear to
auscultation bilaterally with some wheeze at the right base.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no
murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Morbid obesity , nontender ,
normoactive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly. Back: Mild
paraspinal tenderness bilaterally. Extremities: Bilateral lower
extremity edema. Neuro: 2/5 hip flexion and knee extension and
flexion on the right; 5/5 hip flexion and knee extension and
flexion on the right; 5/5 hip flexion and knee extension and
flexion on the left; distal neuropathy.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
At the time of admission , white cell count 9.8 , hematocrit 35.5 ,
platelets 249. INR 2.1 , PTT 45.8. BMP showed a sodium of 139 ,
potassium 4.2 , chloride 99 , bicarbonate 36 , BUN 19 , creatinine
0.6 , glucose 126. LFTs were within normal limits. UA showed 2+
bacteria but no white cells.
In general , this is a 57-year-old female with follicular lymphoma
who presented for workup of lower back pain recurring status post
XRT to the lumbar spine region.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Oncology: CT of the thoracic , lumbar , and sacral spine on
8/18/05 showed no evidence of cord compression but did show a
compression fracture at L2. IR was consulted on 4/18/05
regarding the possibility of kyphoplasty to this area; however ,
they deferred further treatment , as the pain was thought to be
secondary to hip pathology rather than lumbar spine pathology.
CT of the right hip on 4/18/05 showed a lytic lesion in the
posterior acetabulum with an associated fracture. The patient
was evaluated by Orthopedic Oncology as well as Radiation
Oncology. Dr. Cestia with Orthopedic Oncology deferred any
surgical intervention until the completion of radiation therapy.
The patient started radiation therapy to the right hip on
3/29/05 . The contact in Radiation Oncology is Britt L Redden , M.D. , pager number 28468. The plan is for the
patient to complete a course of 18 treatments of radiation to the
right hip. The patient will then have a repeat CT of the right
hip in one month's time and follow up with Dr. Saralegui . She has an
appointment to meet with Dr. Strief on 9/8/05 at 2:45 p.m. Per
recommendations of Orthopedic Oncology and Physical Therapy , the
patient is to be touched down weightbearing on the right leg
( toes only ) and full weightbearing on the left leg. It is
expected that she should be able to undergo physical therapy with
the use of a walker. She should be kept on posterior hip
precaution with limitation of hip flexion and internal rotation
of the right hip.
2. Pain: The patient was seen by the Pain Service during this
hospitalization. Her current pain regimen includes methadone 5
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and 100 mg p.o.
q.8. a.m. and q. noon , MSIR 30 mg p.o. q.h.s. as well as 15-30 mg
q.2h. as needed. The patient was also started on Decadron 10 mg
p.o. q.a.m. given her initial concern for spinal cord
compression. She has been tapering off of the Decadron and will
be discharged on 4 mg p.o. q.a.m. with taper as listed in the
discharge instructions. Once the patient has completed Decadron
2 mg p.o. q.a.m. x3 doses , she should then be started on
prednisone 10 mg p.o. daily per her home dosing for pulmonary
disease. The patient did receive pamidronate 90 mg IV x1 during
this hospitalization.
3. ID: UA on admission was more or less benign , and urine
culture remained negative. The patient was afebrile throughout
her hospitalization. She was given a five-day course of
acyclovir 200 mg p.o. five times per day for concern of recurrent
genital herpes. Given continued complaints of vaginal itching ,
the patient was given fluconazole 150 mg x1 on 10/17/05 to treat
a presumed yeast infection.
4. GI: The patient has a history of constipation secondary to
use of pain medication. She has been having good bowel movement
on MiraLax , Senna , Colace. She has also writing for Dulcolax
p.r.n. for constipation.
5. Heme: The patient is on Coumadin given a recent history of
DVT. She had an INR of 3.7 two days prior to admission , so her
dosing was reduced during this hospitalization. Her INR has been
stable and is at 2.3 at the time of discharge on dosing of 4.5 mg
p.o. q.h.s.
6. Pulmonary: As mentioned above , the patient has a pulmonary
dysfunction with a home O2 requirement of 5 liters. She has been
stable on this home O2 requirement throughout this
hospitalization. She does require CPAP at night for obstructive
sleep apnea.
7. Cardiovascular: No known history of cardiovascular disease.
Echo on 1/28/04 showed an EF of 55%.
8. Endo: The patient is on a sliding scale of regular insulin
while on Decadron. It is intended that this should be stopped
when the Decadron taper has finished.
9. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: The patient had some
hypocalcemia during this hospitalization. She was started on
Tums 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. , with good response. She was also given
pamidronate x1 as listed above.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: hypotension at home
*****************
HPI: 67M w/recent FH admit for fluid overload in the setting of chronic
kidney disease and dietary salt load. He was sent home on higher doses
of his BP meds as well as the addition of HCTZ to his home lasix dose.
He was also sent home on a 10 day course of cipro for a foley-associated
UTI. He did well until the day of admission when he felt tired , checked
his BP himself at home and found it was 86/41 , so he called his doctor
who directed him the the ER. He denies SOB , COP , orthopnea , PND , N/V ,
abdominal pain , or cough. He has had loose stools x 3 days which he
believes is because the VNA increased his stool softeners. In the ED his
BP was 91/60 with a pulse of 60 and he got 1L fluid.

setting of overdiuresis and increased stool output. His BP was fluid
responsive to 1L in the ED , after which he was able to maintain oral
hydration. His diuretics were held during his hospital stay and his
lasix will need to be resumed once he begins to put on water weight ( he
may not need the HCTZ , as the synergy of the two diuretics appears to
have been too much for him ). His ARB was held in the setting of his
acute on chronic renal failure and will also need to be resumed once his
creatinine improves to his baseline. His labetalol dose was also reduced
to allow him to mount a heart rate response to hypotension. His
nifedipine dose stayed the same. He was tolerating a regimen of
labetalol 100mg PO twice a day and nifedipine 120mg PO once a day on
discharge , with systolic blood pressures in the 120-130s.
2 ) RENAL: as noted above , the patient appeared to be in acute on
chronic renal failure from overdiuresis. He continued to make good
urine output ( 1-2L per day ) and his creatinine trended downward. His
ARB was held but will need to be restarted as an outpatient.
3 ) DM: he was maintained on his home regimen of lantus 48 , aspartate qac
and slide scale. He was on a renal , cardiac , diabetic diet.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1 ) Mr. Deasy : your lasix , hydrocholorthiazide , and irbesartan were
stopped. Your doctor will tell you when to restart the irbesartan
( avapro ). Please weigh yourself daily and restart your lasix 80mg once a
day if you gain more than 2 pounds.
2 ) Mr. Pocasangre : your labetalol is now 100mg twice a day ( was 200mg twice a
day ).
3 ) VNA: please check Mr. Outhouse blood pressure , heart rate , and weight
twice a week and call or fax results to PCP.

GI
BRIEF ADMISSION HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Chirico is a 50-year-old male with a history of Hep-C and NASH
cirrhosis who was transferred from the outside hospital with
presumed hepatic encephalopathy after being found unresponsive in
his apartment. Of note , the patient has been in the ED two days
prior to admission on 3/17/2007 for abdominal pain and
distention , at which time labs were within normal limits ,
including no white count , LFTs , but he did have ammonia of 81.
Plan was for paracentesis , but the patient refused and he left
AMA before follow up with his GI doctor could be arranged. His
family was unable to contact him on the evening on 6/11/2007 . A
friend was sent and checked him out in the following morning on
1/13/2006 and the patient was found alone in his apartment and
unresponsive. He was taken to the Charl Lubspi Hospital by EMS on 10/28/2007 , and the patient was tachycardic and
febrile to 100.2 , and only able to open eyes to commands ,
otherwise noncommunicative per report. A diagnostic and
therapeutic paracentesis of 4 liters was performed , which was
negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. His systolic
blood pressure dropped to the 80's post-paracentesis and he had
elevated cardiac enzymes with troponin of 0.49. The patient's
course at the outside hospital was also complicated by UTI ,
status post two days or ciprofloxacin and an acute renal failure
in the setting of diuresis ( creatinine rising from 0.8 and 1.5 ).
Given the patient's extensive history of cardiac/GI treatment at
the Systems/leaj Memorial Hospital , he was transferred to the Nonwelle Geshall Hospital Of on 4/8/2007 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: Undergoing liver transplant
workup. HAV , HCV reactive. HBV negative. Smooth muscle
antibody positive. Large volume ascites with multiple
paracenteses from 3/29 through 8/13 .  Liver biopsied on
8/12 with portal mononuclear inflammation ,
micro/macrovesicular steatosis , focal sinusoidal fibrosis.
2. CAD , status post stent: Cardiac cath done 3/16/2006
revealed proximal LAD with ostial 90% disease , 50% ??____?? LIMA
touchdown , 90% ostial left circumflex , totally occluded RCA ,
patent LIMA to LAD and patent SVG to PDA and radial to diagonal ,
but radial graft to OM was totally occluded. He had a bare-metal
stent placed to left circumflex lesion.
3. Status post CABG in 4/17 with LIMA to LAD , SVG to PDA ,
renal graft to OM and diagonal. Asymptomatic since CABG , but in
workup for liver transplant , the patient was found to have
elevated troponin and taken to cath as above.

NOTABLE STUDIES AND PROCEDURES:
Diagnostic/therapeutic paracenteses x4 using abdominal ultrasound
to mark site ( volumes removed: 6 liters , 6 liters , 1.2 liters ,
and 6 liters.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: On transfer , Mr. Davern is alert and
oriented , but still very confused with limited verbal
communication. Baseline ammonia on 1/26/2007 was 66. He was
continued on lactulose and rifaximin , which were titrated to a
goal to 3-4 bowel movements per day. During his hospitalization ,
the patient was noncompliant with lactulose regimen due to
confusion and had two episodes of decreased responsiveness. During these
episodes , there were no EKG or ABG changes suspicious for ischemia or
hypercapnia or hypoxia. Given his agitation , the patient was placed on
restraints after which
his mental status improved , inflicting a possible voluntary and
metabolic component is decompensation. He was able to contract
with healthcare team as his mental status improved and continued
to be compliant with his regimen. At discharge , he continues to
be alert and oriented , appropriately interactive , and an
ammonia of 16. Plans were to follow up with Dr. Chhuon for
continued evaluation of his possible liver transplant and
management of his hepatic encephalopathy. He should continue on
his lactulose regimen and rifaximin.
2. Ascites: Mr. Angeles 's intake weight was 225 pounds. He
underwent diagnostic therapeutic paracenteses x4. The first two
and fourth procedures removed 6 liters while the third procedure
removed 1.2 liters. Before and after each tap , the patient was
infused with IV albumin at 8 g/liter of ascites fluid removed.
Analysis of ascites fluid showed a SAAG of 1.4 , 2.7 , 3 , and 2.8
respectively , which is consistent with portal hypertension. The
ascites fluid was also negative for spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis. Following each procedure , Mr. Records remained
hemodynamically stable with blood pressures of 80-90/40-50. His
blood pressure and weights remained stable following
paracentesis , reflecting limited reaccumulation fluid.
Discharge weight is 299.9 pounds. He should continue on
diuretics to maintain his ascites at a reasonable level including
Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily and Aldactone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Renal insufficiency: Lasix and Aldactone were initially
started on Mr. Selim 's stay at the KVGH , but they were
discontinued after increasing in serum creatinine from baseline
of 0.8 to 1.4 at the time of transfer. The patient's renal
insufficiency was likely secondary to hypotension with consequent
renal hypoperfusion. Renal ultrasound at the outside hospital
was negative. Following transfer , Mr. Dayhoff was given empiric
hydration challenge with IV normal saline and albumin. He proved
responsive to this treatment with creatinine dropping from 1.4
to 1.1. He was restarted on Lasix 20 mg p.o. and Aldactone 50 mg
p.o. , and gradually titrated up to a discharge dose of Lasix 80
mg p.o. daily and Aldactone 200 mg p.o. daily. His serum
creatinine has remained stable at 0.7 to 0.9. He will follow up
with Dr. Averbeck .
4. Hypotension: Mr. Boger had been hypotensive at the outside
hospital following paracentesis with normal saline placement.
His regimen of lisinopril and nifedipine were consequently held
and discontinued. Given his systolic blood pressures of 80's to
90's , nadolol was also discontinued at the time of transfer.
Throughout his current hospitalization , Mr. Veroeven 's blood
pressures have remained stable in the 80-90/40-50.
5. Troponin leak: Mr. Swogger 's troponin leak at the outside
hospital is likely due to hypovolemic hypoperfusion. He was
continued on aspirin , Plavix , and Zocor at the outside hospital
as he has status post stents and CABG. At the time of transfer ,
his troponin had decreased from 0.49 to 0.15. He has maintained
on aspirin , Plavix , and Zocor , remained stable and asymptomatic
throughout the stay. A repeat troponin performed on 1/26/2007
was less than 0.1 ( less than assay ).
6. UTI: Mr. Couvertier had positive urinalysis at the outside
hospital. He was treated with 3-day course of Cipro. A
urinalysis performed during this admission was negative.
7. Guaiac-positive stool: Likely secondary to straining ,
esophageal , and anorectal varices. The patient's hematocrit had
been stable at 35 to 43. At discharge , recommended workup in EGD
as an outpatient with Dr. Graniela .
8. Contact dermatitis: On hospital day #9 , the patient
developed a contact dermatitis on inner aspect of his thighs ,
thought to be secondary to his urinary and fecal incontinence.
He was treated with topical hydrocortisone and miconazole. He
also developed an infected skin tag on his back , which was
treated with topical bacitracin. These should be continued to be
treated at rehab and followed up by his PCP.
9. Diabetes mellitus: Throughout his hospitalization , Mr.
Lynne blood glucose levels were well controlled with
fingerstick showing blood sugars to 100 to 190. The patient's
metformin and Avandia were held and he was started on insulin
sliding scale , but required minimal coverage. At discharge from
rehab , he should be restarted on his p.o. regimen of Avandia and
metformin. He will follow up with his PCP , Dr. Orizetti .
10. Heme: On admission , INR was 1.7 , likely due to decreased
synthetic function of his liver. He was given a 3-day course of
vitamin K with a good response. At the time of discharge , the patient's
INR was 1.6.
11. Code status: Full code.
12. Disposition: To rehab.

Discharge Date: 4/23/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS:
1. NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA.
2. HODGKIN'S DISEASE , STATUS POST MECHLORETHAMINE , VINCRISTINE ,
PROCARBAZINE , AND PREDNISONE CHEMOTHERAPY TEN YEARS AGO.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. STATUS POST TOTAL ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Three days of shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Kayser is an African American
female who is 72 years of age with a
history of Hodgkin's disease status post MOPP chemotherapy , and
more recently diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for which she
is being treated with CHOP chemotherapy. She was tolerating the
chemotherapy without complications until developing symptoms of
fatigue as well as shortness of breath over a three to four day
period prior to admission. In July 1997 , Ms. Vanzile presented to
the Oncology Clinic with a biliary obstruction that was shown to be
a peripancreatic mass and a left subclavicular lymph node. Biopsy
of the subclavicular lymph node revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ,
for which she was treated with CHOP chemotherapy. Given her
previous exposure to Adriamycin for treatment of Hodgkin's disease
ten years previously , the patient's cardiac function was followed
and serial echocardiograms over the past six months. The previous
three cycles of CHOP chemotherapy were complicated with a
peripancreatic abscess which was treated with intravenous then oral
antibiotics with good resolution. She , subsequently , three more
cycles of CHOP chemotherapy and was in near complete remission by
gallium scan; however , a persistent abdominal mass was still
detected on Computerized Tomography scan. Her therapy was stopped
after five cycle of CHOP due to the maximum Adriamycin dose of 460
mg/m2. The patient was being restaged and was found to develop
acute shortness of breath over the weekend , denying any chest pain ,
nausea or vomiting , or light-headedness. The patient denies any
changes in her activities except for becoming more tired with
exertion and wakening up suddenly the night prior to admission
feeling short of breath.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma , Hodgkin's
disease , hypertension , and a total abdominal
hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals a well-developed , well-nourished
elderly woman who is able to speak complete
sentences , but with some difficulty. Her vital signs were a heart
rate of 140; respiration rate of 32 to 36. Oxygen saturation of
92% on room air and is afebrile. The neck examination revealed a
jugular venous pressure of 8 centimeters. No thyromegaly or
lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Chest examination revealed
bilateral lower lobe rales , no rhonchi or wheezes were appreciated.
Coronary examination revealed tachycardic rate and rhythm with a
positive S3. The abdomen was benign. There is no edema at the
lower extremities.
LABORATORY: Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia at 130 ,
normal axes and intervals. No ST or T wave changes.
Her profile-7 is remarkable for a potassium of 3.3 , otherwise
unremarkable. The patient has an elevated LDH. Cholesterol level
was 243 and elevated triglyceride level of 197. Complete blood
count was significant for an elevated white count of 11 , 600;
hematocrit of 39.9 with an MCV of 91.2; and platelet count of
131 , 000. There was a normal differential of the complete blood
count. Her coags are also within normal parameters. The
urinalysis was benign.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Problem number one is the patient's shortness of
breath. Given the acute onset of shortness of
breath and dyspnea upon exertion , causes contributing to the change
in pulmonary status included pulmonary embolism , congestive heart
failure , and pneumonia. Of note , the patient's chest x-ray
revealed bilateral pleural effusions. However , the patient was
afebrile. Therefore , our suspicion for pneumonia was low. The
patient received an echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function.
The echocardiogram on June , 1997 , revealed a mildly enlarged
ventricle with moderately decreased systolic function. Estimated
ejection fraction was 30%. Global hypokinesis was identified along
with a marked significant involvement of the apex as well as the
anterior septal and inferior regions of the heart. Normal right
ventricular systolic function was observed. Also noted is that
there was a small pericardial effusion with an elevated PA pressure
of 36. There was also the existence of mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation. All of this had
little change from the echocardiogram taken on May , 1997 ,
which revealed an ejection fraction of 30% to 35% along with
hypokinesis and a small pericardial effusion. This was markedly
different from the patient's echocardiogram in January 1997 with
revealed an ejection fraction of 67% with normal left ventricular
function and no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was started
on a Lasix regimen in order to start diuresis with good response to
intravenous Lasix. The patient also was less dependent on oxygen
supplements , however , the patient still reported episodes of
dyspnea upon minor activity. A cardiology consultation was
obtained to evaluate the deterioration in the patient's cardiac
function. This deterioration was associated with the toxicity of
Adriamycin. A repeat echocardiogram was obtained to evaluate the
pericardial effusion as well as an abnormality identified on the
May , 1997 , echocardiogram consistent with a possible rupture
of one of the chordae tendineae. There was little difference
between the echocardiogram from May , 1997 , June , 1997 ,
and February , 1997. The patient was maintained on a regimen of
Lasix as well as Ace inhibitors. Initially , the addition of
ionatrope was considered. However , given the patient's history of
potassium and magnesium wasting , it was decided to add digoxin to
the patient's medical regimen.
The patient was also evaluated for the possibility of developing a
pulmonary embolus. Lower extremity noninvasive examinations
revealed patent vasculature , but no indication of a lower extremity
deep venous thrombosis. The patient also received a VQ scan which
revealed a low probability of the presence of a pulmonary embolus.
After the obtaining of a VQ scan which was negative , the heparin
that was initially stated upon admission of the patient , was
stopped.
The patient was discharged on a regimen of enalapril as well as
Lasix in order to manage the congestive heart failure. The
etiology of the congestive heart failure was thought to the
Adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy.
Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient has a history of
a potassium and magnesium wasting. Serial profile-7s were obtained
and potassium and magnesium were regularly supplemented. The
patient was discharged with a daily regimen of potassium.
DISPOSITION: The patient showed marked clinical improvement with
diuresis as well as actively reduction with an Ace inhibitor. The
patient was warned that she needed to watch her salt intake. Of
note , the patient was noted not to be compliant with a low-salt
diet. Three days before admission , the patient admitted to having
a Chinese food dinner which may have contributed to the patient's
element of congestive heart failure.
The patient was discharged with the following medications: Colace
100 mg b.i.d.; Vasotec 10 mg q.d.; Lasix 20 mg q.d.; KCl 10 mEq
q.d.; and magnesium gluconate 500 mg q.d.
The patient was discharged in stable condition , with followup with
Dr. Gransberry of Lourdesko Memorial Hospital Oncology.

1. Myocardial infarction.
2. Ventricular fibrillation arrest.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
2. Diabetes type 2.
3. Peripheral vascular disease.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. Depression.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ).
8. History of GI bleed.
9. Obstructive sleep apnea.
10. Status post cholecystectomy.
11. Status post coronary artery bypass graft with aortic valve
replacement.
12. History of transfusion reaction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old male
with coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass
graft in 1982 , also status post Bjork-Shiley aortic valve
replacement for bicuspid aortic valve , status post redo CABG in
1995 with SVG to OM2 and SVG to LAD , who presented to Nalcon Memorial Hospital after developing chest pain unrefractory to
nitroglycerin. En route to the ER , he suffered a ventricular
fibrillation arrest , was defibrillated x1 with 120 Joules to a
rhythm of pulseless electrical activity. He then received fluids
and lidocaine bolus and he recovered his pulse and blood pressure
and was intubated in the field.
Of note , the patient had an AVR Bjork-Shiley and saphenous vein
graft to LAD and left circumflex sequential grafting , original
surgery in 1982. In 1985 , he underwent reoperation with
saphenous vein graft to LAD and saphenous vein graft to OM2. He
has had multiple admissions to Estatewentlung Lufirm Community Medical Center in the past
year. In September 2003 , he was admitted with chest pain. He ruled in
for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and was taken to the
catheterization lab. At the cath lab in September 2003 , at Dotonh/ Medical Center he had a left main with a tight ostial lesion.
He had saphenous vein graft to LAD , it was patent , saphenous vein
graft to OM2 was patent with a tight 95% stenosis proximally in
OM2 at the touchdown site inhibiting retrograde profusion. It
was determined at this point that PCI would be inappropriate. At
that time and echo showed an EF of 25% with moderate mitral
regurgitation and right ventricular systolic pressures of 47. He
was medically managed on nitrates , an ACE inhibitor ,
beta-blocker , digoxin , and Lasix. Per his wife , he had been
doing well since April of 2003 , only sublingual nitrogens on
occasion , but today , on the day of admission he ate lunch with
his son and then developed his typical substernal chest pain , but
this time did not have relief with sublingual nitrogen x 3. He
called EMS who arrived at the scene and he had the following code
status mentioned above with a VF arrest and then a PEA arrest.
On arrival to Tonwa Medical Center he had a heart rate of 132 , blood
pressure 89/61 , and respiratory rate 28. He was given normal
saline 2 liters , dopamine drip , Lopressor 5 mg IV push , and he
was paralyzed , at which point it was determined that the patient
would likely need urgent cardiac catheterization for suspected
myocardial infarction. He was transferred the Specce Health Care Cardiac Cath lab emergently.

function is normal.
In summary , the patient is a 60-year-old male with chronic
coronary artery disease , now status post a VF arrest in the
setting of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with isolated ST
elevation in V3. He was admitted for critical care to the
Cardiac Intensive Care Unit at Lungken Medical Center .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was transferred
emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where
catheterization revealed severe native 3VD and vein graft
disease. His left main is moderately sized with a distal 60%
lesion. The mid LAD was proximally occluded after the first
septa. His left circumference is proximally occluded. The
distal LAD after vein graft is without significant disease and
the distal OM branch after the vein graft is diffusely diseased
with focal 99% lesion after the distal anastomosis. Saphenous
vein graft to LAD is patent , saphenous vein graft to OM has 99%
lesion in distal anastomosis with _____ flow and a tilting disk
aortic valve that appears to be functioning normally. In
summary , the patient had what was considered to be a
nonintervenable coronary artery disease and thus he was admitted
for medical management. He received optimal medical management
for his acute myocardial infarction including aspirin and Plavix ,
statin , beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor as tolerated. His ischemic
EKG changes have resolved at the time of transfer out of the
Coronary Care Unit and he has been chest pain-free for the
remainder of that day. His CK peaked at 1090 on 6/17/03 . Pump:
The patient was anticoagulated with heparin for a goal PTT of
6084 for his Bjork-Shiley valve. His Coumadin was held in the
setting. He had a TTE on 6/17/03 , which showed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 25% with inferoposterior HK ,
left atrial enlargement , mild to moderate MR , and well-seated
AVR. The patient was rapidly weaned off dopamine and
Neo-Synephrine during his ICU stay and he was transferred out to
the floor , once he was considered to be euvolemic. Rhythm: As
noted above , the patient admitted with status post VF arrest. He
was successfully defibrillated out of that with shock x 1.
However , his course was complicated by an episode of atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate up to the 160s
associated with hypotension for which he was electively
cardioverted with shock x 1 to normal sinus rhythm after which he
was loaded with a 10-g amio load , and he has remained in normal
sinus rhythm since that episode. However , after the patient had
been transferred to the floor and was stable , he received a
single lead AICD given his history of dilated cardiomyopathy ,
coronary artery disease , and status post VF arrest.
Pulmonary: The patient was initially intubated in the CCU for
airway protection. He was rapidly weaned on the sedation. He
was successfully extubated on 1/28/03 . However , his chest x-ray
was complicated by left lower lobe infiltrate , which was
concerning for pneumonia. He ultimately has sputum culture that
grew out pseudomonas and he has been treated with a 14-day course
for pseudomonal pneumonia. Please see ID section below for more
details.
Infectious Disease: The patient with hypotension and question of
sepsis , septic physiology on 1/28/03 . He was started on empiric
levofloxacin and Flagyl for question aspiration pneumonia by
chest x-ray. He was also given one dose of gentamicin and then
covered his broad into ceftaz , vanc , levo , and Flagyl while
awaiting results. He ultimately had no growth from any blood
cultures , although did have on sputum culture positive for
pseudomonas which was sensitive to ceftazidime , but resistant to
levofloxacin. He was ultimately switched over to single agent
ceftazidime for a total of 14-day course for pseudomonal
pneumonia/bronchitis.
Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of 1.6 and 2.0. In the Intensive Care Unit ,
he had a rise of his creatinine up to a peak of 2.8. At the time
of discharge , he still has slightly elevated creatinine at 2.2 ,
although it seems to be normalizing. It is likely that this is
contributed by his Dilaudid received at the time of
catheterization.
Heme: The patient anticoagulated at home with Coumadin and then
during his hospitalization with unfractionated heparin for his
Bjork-Shiley valve with a goal PTT of 60 to 80. At the time of
discharge , he is being recoumadinized with a goal INR of 2.5 to
3.5. Previously , his home dose of Coumadin had been 2 mg p.o.
q.d. He will need to have his heparin dripped to 10 units
therapeutically with PTT 60 to 80 until his INR is therapeutic on
Coumadin. Hematology continued the patient also with a
macrocytic anemia , currently on folate therapy. At the time of
discharge , his labs were pending for a B12 level , methylmalonic
acid , and homocysteine did need to be followed up while the
patient is at rehab.
Endocrine: The patient with diabetes. He was continued on NPH
with a Regular Insulin sliding scale with good control of his
sugars. At the time of discharge , he should remain on his NPH
with sliding scale coverage.
FEN: The patient was placed on ADA diet and his electrolytes were
repleted p.r.n.
Prophylaxis: The patient on therapeutic anticoagulation. He was
also placed on a proton pump inhibitor for symptomatic GERD.
Tubes , lines , and drains: The patient had an NG tube for a short
time during his Intensive Care Unit stay while was intubated for
enteral feeding. This was subsequently removed and the patient
has been able to take adequate p.o. intake. However , he has a
dual lumen peripherally inserted central catheter placed in his
right antecubital fossa on 3/9/03 for intravenous access for IV
heparin as well as to continue his 14-day course of ceftazidime.
Pertinent labs at the time of discharge include a BUN of 53 ,
creatinine of 2.2 , white blood cell count of 11.4 with 73% polys ,
20% lymphocytes , 6% monos , 2% eosinophils , and 1% basophils.
Hematocrit of 33.3 , which is stable , platelets of 175. His MCV
was 96.8 and his RDW was 18.0. His last PTT was 66.1 and INR was
1.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CARDIOVASCULAR: Anterolateral ST-elevation MI - On
5/1/2005 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which
revealed 100% stenosis of the LAD , 60% stenosis of the left
circumflex , 80% stenosis of the first marginal , and 100% stenosis
of the RCA , with collateral flow from the LAD to the RCA. Her
LAD was stented. She was treated with Integrilin , aspirin ,
Plavix , Lopressor , captopril , and Lipitor. Her peak cardiac
markers were on 8/29/2005 and were as follows: CK 3344 , MB
386.4 , troponin I 191.4. Her EKG changes were slow to resolve.
Her admission EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm , first-degree A-V
block , and new right bundle-branch block. On 8/29/2005 , the
patient developed transient complete heart block. Gel pads were
placed , but the patient regained her native rhythm. A temporary
wire was placed. On 4/21/2005 , the temporary wire failed to
capture and was adjusted. On 1/23/2005 , the patient was taken
back to the cardiac catheterization lab with the idea of
precluding any further ischemic triggers to complete heart block.
A stent was placed in the first marginal. On 10/4/2005 , early
in the morning , the patient aroused from bed ( despite bed-rest
precautions ). Her temporary wire was apparently dislodged. This
wire was then pulled. The patient developed chest pain without
EKG changes. She subsequently developed hypotension. There was
clinical evidence of tamponade including distant heart sounds and
cool extremities. The patient was taken emergently to the
cardiac catheterization lab. A stat echo performed in the
cardiac catheterization lab revealed a large pericardial effusion
with diastolic collapse of the right atrium and right ventricle.
A pericardiocentesis was performed for 600 mL of bloody fluid.
It was thought that the temporary wire had perforated the right
ventricle and that the whole failed on its own. In the cardiac
catheterization lab , the patient developed asystole. A temporary
wire was replaced. On 8/3/2005 and 10/22/2005 , echocardiogram
showed no evidence of pericardial effusion reaccumulation. The
patient's ejection fraction was preserved at 45 to 50%. There
was evidence of hypokinesis of the apical , inferoseptal , and
basal and mid inferior walls. On 10/22/2005 , the patient's
second temporary wire was pulled. The patient remained in her
native rhythm. She had rare runs of asymptomatic NSVT ranging
from 5 to 11 beats. She was without chest pain or shortness of
breath for the duration of her hospital stay. It was thought
that the patient did not require a permanent pacemaker or AICD
placement at the present time. The patient was discharged on
aspirin , Plavix , Toprol , lisinopril , and Lipitor. She had not
been on a statin previously. Her LFTs will require monitoring.
Notably , her fasting lipids included total cholesterol of 136 , an
HDL of 38 , an LDL of 98 , and triglycerides of 149.
2. PULMONARY: The patient required oxygen by nasal cannula
during her hospitalization. Status post pericardiocentesis , she
was weaned off oxygen. On the day of discharge , she was able to
ambulate on room air without desaturating.
3. ENDOCRINE: Diabetes mellitus. The patient was on oral
antihyperglycemics at home. In-house , she was treated standing
Lantus as well as Novolog standing and sliding scale q.a.c. She
was discharged on metformin. She has a normal creatinine
clearance.
4. HEME: Hematocrit. The patient's hematocrit dropped down
from the low 40s on admission to the low 30s on discharge. This
drop was attributed largely to blood loss ( right groin hematoma
status post 5/1/2005 cardiac catheterization - subsequently
stabilized; and pericardiocentesis on 10/4/2005 ). There was a
desire to keep the patient's hematocrit above 30 given her acute
coronary syndrome; however , the patient refused for transfusion.
In the days prior to discharge , the patient's hematocrit
stabilized. If her hematocrit remains low , she might benefit
from outpatient anemia workup , including iron studies , B12 ,
folate , reticulocyte count , and smear.
5. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Urinary tract infection. The patient
developed a urinary tract infection. Urine culture on 8/29/2005
showed greater than 100 , 000 proteus. She was treated initially
with levofloxacin , then Bactrim. A urine culture from 8/3/2005
showed no growth.
6. POSTPROCEDURE PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was treated
transiently with Ancef status post temporary wire placement.
Blood cultures on admission were negative. Blood cultures were
not rechecked given that the patient remained afebrile without
signs of bacteremia.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Colace 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 ( 0.4 mg ) 1 tab sublingual every
5 minutes x3 doses , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily , Plavix 75 mg p.o.
daily , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily , Toprol XL 150 mg p.o. daily ,
metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to take her
medications as directed , particularly the Plavix. The patient
was instructed to follow up with Dr. Vanbelle in clinic on
6/24/2005 and with Dr. Bradly Moerke at the Medwinds Hospital .  She was instructed to call her doctor and present
to the emergency room if she experienced any chest pain ,
shortness of breath , palpitations , fainting , or any other
symptoms concerning to her.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with home
services.

disease. The patient presents with multiple syncopal episodes in
the week prior to admission. Cardiac risk factors include
diabetes , hypertension and a positive family history. He does not
smoke and has normal cholesterol. He has chronic stable angina for
which he needs one to three nitroglycerin per day over several
months. He has been gaining weight and has increasing peripheral
edema. He also notes decreased exercise tolerance and increasing
fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. He complains of PND but denies
orthopnea. In 2/10 he had a standard Bruce exercise test in which
he went 8 minutes and 15 seconds , stopping for typical chest pain
with a heart rate of 150 and blood pressure of 186/90. He had no
EKG changes and no arrhythmias. Thallium scanning showed anterior
and apical perfusion defects with delayed reperfusion.
Echocardiography at that time showed mild concentric hypertrophy
and akinesis of the anterior , lateral and apical walls. He had
only mildly decreased left ventricular function and no valvular
disease. The patient has been admitted to the Shire Health Center where he has undergone coronary angiography ,
which showed that his coronary arteries had no significant
obstruction. Over the week prior to admission he had four episodes
of syncope which occurred at various times , not related to meals.
He was usually standing or walking just prior to the episode.
There is a 15 to 30 second prodrome of nausea , diaphroresis , and
the sensation of spinning. He does not have chest pain or
shortness of breath. He has had a total of four episodes with loss
of consciousness and falling. He does have urinary incontinence
but has not been witnessed to have involuntary movements. There is
no post ictal state. There has been no recent change in his
medical regimen. The patient also describes the symptoms of
snoring at night with fatigue and has been noticed to make gasping
sounds during sleep. He complains of waking up frequently at night ,
feeling as though he cannot catch his breath and admits to a weight
gain of 100 pounds over the last several years. He has a history
of depression and suicidal ideation and currently is depressed and
has had thoughts of wishing he were dead. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

has a normal S1 and S2 with an S4. There is no murmur. Abdomen
obese without masses. Rectal: Guaiac negative. Normal prostate.
He has edema to his knees bilaterally. Neurologic: He has
pressured speech and a tearful affect. He is alert and oriented.
CNs intact. Motor strength is full. He has no sensory deficits
and normal position sense. He has diminished reflexes throughout
but downgoing toes bilaterally.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: He had a glucose of 323 , but otherwise
normal admission laboratories except for
an LDH of 529 and an alkaline phosphatase of 151. Admission CK was
138 , amylase of 56 , lipase of 52. Hemoglobin A1C 8.3 , cholesterol
170 , UA shows 2+ glucose. Chest x-ray shows a normal size heart
with clear lungs. EKG shows sinus at 70 with normal axis and
intervals. There are flat T waves in I , L , and III , but no change
from a previous EKG.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent Holter monitoring in which
he had no arrhythmias. He occasionally had sinus
tachycardia. An exercise test showed that he went six minutes and
17 seconds of a standard Bruce protocol. His maximum heart rate
was 140 and blood pressure was 210/60. There were no EKG changes
with the exception of unifocal PVCs , so that there was no evidence
for ischemia. He had an echocardiogram which showed normal valves
and normal left ventricular function. Notably the right side of
his heart was also normal. The patient also underwent sleep study
during the day after sleep deprivation the previous night. The
study lasted only 1-1/2 hours and the patient was not noted during
that time to have sleep apnea. However , an overnight study was
recommended.
DISPOSITION: Discharge medications are the same as his admission
medications with the addition of Prozac 20 mg
p.o.q.d. He follows up with Dr. Lonnie Otanicar in RY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL clinic.

Discharge Date: 5/13/1992
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 72 year old black female
with a history of hypertension ,
angina , adult onset diabetes , admitted after a syncopal event. She
has a known history of syncope which dates as far back as the late
1960s. In 1970 she had an episode of loss of consciousness with 30
seconds of generalized tonic convulsions witnessed by her daughter.
An EEG at that time showed diffuse theta waves but was nonfocal.
The patient was treated with Dilantin for less than a year. In
1972 she had another episode of syncope associated with
hyperventilation. In 1983 she had yet another episode of syncope
and a 24 hour Holter started after the event showed a heart rate
that went as low as 38 but was not associated with any symptoms. In
1987 she had a vasovagal event which was later aggravated when her
neighbor gave her a nitroglycerin tablet. Throughout this time she
has had multiple other episodes of syncope. Her last episode was
in 1989 , when she was admitted to the Cardiology Team for workup.
Her EKG was unremarkable , 24 hour Holter was normal , an
echocardiogram was normal , and she underwent an exercise stress
test which did not show ischemic changes. In October of 1992 , she
had carotid ultrasounds for symptoms of right hand and leg
numbness. They did not show significant stenosis. In October of
1992 , she was admitted and ruled out for a myocardial infarction
and was started on Isordil and Lopressor empirically but these were
later discontinued. In February of 1992 she had a clinic visit with
Dr. Ed Ville who is her CALL MEDICAL CENTER doctor. The patient indicates
that she has stable exertional angina without limitation of daily
activity , chest pain is relieved with nitroglycerin and her most
recent episode was last week. She has also been on a stable dose
of Micronase for the last couple of years. On the morning of
admission , the patient awoke and felt fine , and was getting ready
to have coffee with her friends upstairs. She was reaching for
something across the table and suddenly felt a sharp pain in her
back and fell unconscious into the chair. Estimated loss of
consciousness was 6-7 minutes. She awoke confused , did not know
her name and had a little bit of difficulty seeing. It was unclear
by her history whether her vision was blurry or whether she felt
that there was a shade across her eyes. She denies any double
vision. Prior to this event she did not experience any prodrome or
aura. She also denied chest pain , shortness of breath or
palpitations. There was no loss of bladder or bowel function
during the event. The patient was given orange juice after the
episode and gradually she regained awareness of her surroundings.
Her vital signs were stable. She was brought to Tia Medical Center
for evaluation. There was a question of upper extremity twitching
by report from observers. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension
dating at least 10 years back and is presently not requiring any
treatment. She has a history , as mentioned , of recurrent syncopal
events. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with adult onset
diabetes and has been on a stable dose of Micronase. The patient
also has a history of multiple colonic polyps and in 1983 underwent
a left hemicolectomy for multiple polyps. In 1988 she underwent an
ileal resection for large inflammatory polyps leading to a small
bowel obstruction. She has had a cholecystectomy and an
appendectomy in the distant past. The patient also a history of
glaucoma. In 1973 and 1976 she had a right lower extremity DVT ,
etiology was unclear. The patient does not smoke , drink or use any
drugs. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION include aspirin one tablet q d ,
Questran one pack q d , Micronase 5 mg po q d , Betaxolol eye drops
bid to each eye , Pilocarpine eye drops tid to each eye ,
eye drops bid to each eye. The patient receives monthly Vitamin
B12 injections. She also takes nitroglycerin with chest pain.
FAMILY HISTORY is significant for a brother who suffered a stroke
at the age of 74. There is also a family history of heart attacks.
No family history of gastrointestinal cancer. SOCIAL HISTORY: The
patient is separated and lives by herself in Hutmill Rd. , Bock Tonlake Son , North Dakota 32472 She has
eight children with many grandchildren. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS is
notable for episodes of sweats and nervousness over the last week
which she describes as being similar to the hot flashes of
menopause which she had at age 49. These episodes are occurring a
few times a day but do not in any way coincide with her syncopal
events. She is also complaining of right hand and foot numbness
which have increased in frequency. The numbness occasionally wakes
her up at night. She denies any motor weakness whatsoever.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is an elderly , mildly obese female , in
no apparent distress. She was afebrile , with
a blood pressure of 126/70 , a heart rate of 60 , and a respiratory
rate of 18. HEENT exam was notable for pinpoint constriction of
her pupils secondary to her glaucoma eyedrops. Her pupils were
reactive. Her throat was benign. She had dentures. Her neck was
supple , without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. Chest exam
revealed bibasilar , coarse crackles. On cardiac exam she had no
jugular venous distention , and carotids were normal without bruits.
She had a regular rate and rhythm with S1 , S2 , and an occasional
S4. There were no murmurs. Abdominal exam was benign. The patient
was guaiac negative. Extremities were without edema and there was
no calf tenderness. The neurologic exam was entirely nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Includes a sodium of 143 , potassium of 4.3 ,
chloride of 109 , bicarbonate of 20 , BUN of 21;
creatinine was 1.0. The glucose was 160. Her calcium and
phosphate were normal. Her hematocrit was 43.4 , her white count
6.45 with a normal differential. Her coagulation factors were
normal. Her liver function tests were normal. A chest X ray
showed a calcific aorta but was otherwise clear. C spine X ray and
head CT on admission were also negative. The EKG showed no changes
from her baseline.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was placed on a cardiac monitor , and
her Micronase was held. In fact , her fingerstick
glucose went as low as 80 that evening. On day two of admission ,
the patient had syncopal event while in house. She was apparently
walking about after having washed her face and was reaching to pull
the curtain when she began feeling lightheaded. She told the nurse
immediately , who tried to get her on the bed , and the patient
collapsed on the bed , was limp and lost consciousness for about 3-5
minutes. She had a systolic blood pressure of 200/105 and a heart
rate of 90. There were no changes on the cardiac monitor , and the
patient was noted to maintain a strong pulse at all times. She was
given Nitro Paste and 1 amp of D50. Fingerstick glucose was then
noted to be 232. The patient was witnessed to have mild twitching
of her jaw and eyelids and after five minutes , she opened her eyes
but was not able to respond. When asked to give her name , she was
not able to answer. The confusion subsided over the next couple of
minutes , and the patient was able to respond and was alert and
oriented. However , she had no recollection of the event. Further
workup included a head MRI , MR angiogram of her vertebrobasilar
circulation , a sleep deprived EEG , a cardiac echo , and a 24 hour
Holter. All of the above were negative. We also applied carotid
sinus stimulation and she showed no change in heart rate to either
side. The etiology of her syncopal event is not completely clear.
It appears that the patient does have a history of a witnessed
seizure but also has had syncopal events consistent with either
bradycardia or a vasovagal event.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home with plans for a
repeat 24 hour Holter as an outpatient. FOLLOW UP:
She will follow up with Dr. Danilo Mcquaid in the THERPLEA HOSPITAL Clinic.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS include

Discharge Date: 9/22/2003
Date of Discharge: 9/22/2003
ATTENDING: SYDNEY VELOVIC MD
SERVICE: Chief Surgery.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 72-year-old male
who presented to his primary care doctor in early September with
dysphagia and acolasia and epigastric pain. He had an upper
endoscopy which showed an ulcer in the distal esophagus and
proximal stomach. He had a repeat EGD and biopsies of the ulcer
which showed adenocarcinoma of the proximal stomach and distal
esophagus. Metastatic workup showed only thickening at the GE
junction and one enlarged lymph node in the periportal region 3.4
x 1.6 cm. The patient was referred to Dr. Dunks for resection
and was planned for an esophagectomy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history includes
hypertension , ischemic cardiomyopathy , noninsulin dependent
diabetes , kidney stones , status post laser lithotripsy , history
of hyponatremia , myocardial infarction six years ago ,
hypercholesterolemia , and an infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm.
HOME MEDICATIONS: Prevacid 30 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 10 mg q.day ,
Toprol-XL 50 mg q.day , Glyburide 2.5 mg q.day , Zestril 5 mg
q.day , aspirin 325 mg q.day and Coumadin alternating 5 and 2.5 mg
p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient came into the hospital , after
admission was taken to the operating room on 9/5/03 . In the
operating room he underwent exploratory laparotomy biopsy of a
portacaval lymph node. Uterolithotomy on the right side , liver
biopsy , cystoscopy , placement of double J ureteral stent on the
right side and open nephrolithotomy. The large right ureteral
stone was found upon exploration and urology was called for an
intraoperative consult. Please see both Dr. Moriarity and Dr.
Cushard dictated reports for more information. There was a
very high amount of blood loss approximately 17 liters
intraoperatively from venous plexus bleeding of the pelvis and
kidney and the patient was closed after stomach mobilization
without resection of his tumor and admitted to the Angeles Vandie Morepa surgical
intensive care unit. The patient was left intubated due to his
large fluid and blood product replacement and surrounding facial
edema. He was kept intubated , paralyzed and sedated , started on
Lopressor , put on a rule out MI protocol , kept NPO with an
NG-tube. His electrolytes , CBC and coagulation labs were
corrected. The patient had multiple abdominal drains and was
kept on triple antibiotics. Over the next several days , the
patient was kept intubated and sedated. His chest x-rays
revealed some early ARDS and he continued to need blood product
including red cell and platelet and FFP transfusions. He
underwent bronchoscopy in the intensive care unit and was slowly
weaned on his valve dilatory settings. Over postop day 4 , 5 and
6 the patient began to spike some fevers up to 102. He had been
weaned to pressure support ventilation and was beginning to auto
diurese. He then started on tube feeds of small amounts which
were increased as tolerated.
Over the next couple of days as the patient's sedation was weaned
and he woke up more , it was noticed that he had decreased
movement of his left lower extremity and upon examination and
given his recurrent fevers , there was a question of an epidural
hematoma. He was scheduled for an MRI to assess this. He was
tolerating tube feeds well and these were increased and his labs
were stabilizing. Neurosurgery was consulted and it was
ascertained that the patient did have an epidural hematoma ,
therefore his epidural was removed and this was deemed likely to
be secondary to trauma from the epidural. It was decided that
the patient would benefit from evacuation of epidural hematoma
and the patient was made NPO and taken back to the operating room
on 8/18/03 . He underwent a T5-T8 laminectomy with evacuation of
the epidural hematoma. Please see the dictated operative report
for more information , but a handful of clot was removed from the
area. The patient was transferred back to Or Ox Nor , intubated and
stable having tolerated the procedure well.
Thereafter , the patient was more awake and alert and more quickly
weaned off his ventilatory support. His fingersticks were more
difficult to control and he was therefore started on the
Heartland protocol and was seen by the Diabetes Management
Service. The patient was extubated on 9/11/03 and was doing well
on a face mask on that day. His tube feeds were restarted and
speech and swallow was consulted to evaluate the patient. He
began to be seen by physical therapy for his lower extremity
weakness. The Cardiology Service was consulted on 8/18 and asked
to optimize medical management of the patient's ischemic
cardiomyopathy. They recommended discontinuing and titrating the
patient's Lopressor. He had been somewhat tachycardic previously
and this resolved shortly. Speech and swallow saw the patient
and initially cleared him for soft foods and thickened foods and
this was likely just due to endotracheal tube trauma. After
another day or two they cleared him for all regular foods
including thin liquids without any restrictions.
For the patient's epidural hematoma , he had been started on
Vancomycin and it was decided that he would get a total of a
three week course of Vancomycin. Urology continued to followed
the patient and wanted at least one Blake drain kept in place and
the Foley catheter kept in place. The patient did have a CT scan
on 10/19/03 which demonstrated no urine leak on the CT urogram.
The patient continued to be seen by physical therapy every day
and was doing very well. It was very difficulty initially to
normalize him but by the time of discharge he was up walking with
the walker with physical therapy and doing quite well.
Infectious disease was consulted to confirm the three week course
of Vancomycin was appropriate for the patient's epidural
hematoma , and they agreed and thought no other interventions or
treatment as needed at the time. The patient was transferred out
of the intensive care unit on 10/19/03 .
Neuro: At this time he was getting increasingly more oriented.
He had had some ICU psychosis and confusion and he was taking no
pain medication. He was stable from his neurosurgery procedure
and neurosurgery was following him.
Pulmonary: His lungs were clear. He was now stable on room air.
From a cardiovascular standpoint , he was stable and continued on
his low dose Lopressor.
Gastroenterology: He was tolerating a house diet , eating small
amounts.
GU: As stated , the urologist wanted to keep the Foley catheter
and keep one of the Blake drains upon discharge.
From a hematology standpoint , the patient had a stable
hematocrit. From an infectious disease standpoint , the patient
was continued on IV Vancomycin for three weeks. He had a PICC
line placed on 9/22/03 which was put in good position.
From an endocrine standpoint , he was placed on glyburide ,
continued to be followed by diabetes and also on a humalog scale.
From an activity standpoint , he was seen by physical therapy
every day.
Over the ensuing few days he was begun on calorie counts to see
how much of the diet he was tolerating and he continued to work
with physical therapy. His glyburide and insulin doses were
tweaked a little bit by the diabetes management service and he
was improving every day as was his mental status. He had been
discharged from the unit with a one-to-one sitter but this was
very soon thereafter stopped on 10/21/03 . He was stable medically
about 3/11 or 2/4/03 for discharge and was ______ for a
rehabilitation facility appropriately. He was accepted to a
rehab facility near his home on 5/16/03 , Dis University Hospital and was ready
to go.
From a neurologic standpoint , he is awake and oriented x3 most of
his time. His back limbs are stable. The staples have been
removed by neurosurgery and he will follow up with Dr. Ochwat
from Neurosurgery in a couple of weeks. From a cardiovascular
standpoint , he has been restarted on all of his home medications
and his blood pressure and heart rate had been stable on those.
From a pulmonary standpoint , he currently has no issues and is
breathing well on room air. From a GI standpoint , he is
tolerating an ADA diet with diabetic booster , Ensure and has been
eating fairly well the last couple of days. From a GU
standpoint , he is urinating sufficiently and he will keep his
Foley catheter and Blake drain. From an endocrine standpoint , he
is on glyburide twice a day and twice a day fingersticks with
humalog sliding scale. From an infectious disease standpoint , he
has a well functioning PICC and has been fine and will begin on
Vancomycin for a total of three weeks. Today , 5/16/03 is day 8 of
21 of the Vancomycin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: On physical exam , the patient
is awake and oriented in no acute distress. His lungs are clear
to auscultation bilaterally. His heart is regular , rate and
rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen is soft , nontender ,
nondistended with a well healing midline incision scar with some
Steri-Strips still in place. He has one Blake drain in place on
the right side which is functioning well. His extremities have
no edema and his Foley catheter is in place and working well.
OPERATIONS: Operations are as indicated above on 9/5/03 and
8/18/03 . Please see above. Complications are bleeding
intraoperatively 9/5/03 , abortion of the indicated procedure on
9/5/03 and an epidural hematoma requiring reoperation on
8/18/03 .

Discharge Date: 5/25/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HEMOPTYSIS.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45 year-old male who
presents to the Wek Bri Medical Center Emergency Department with low back pain and a five day
history of hemoptysis. The patient has an extensive psychiatric
history and an apparent history of tuberculosis treated in 1987 for
one year ( confirmation of this fact is not found at the present
time ). The patient presents with a five day history of hemoptysis.
The patient notes that he has had blood tinged sputum and
occasional bright red blood for the past five days totalling about
1/8th of a cup a day. He denies any fevers , chills or other sputum
production , but he notes a positive cough. He is homeless and was
exposed to cold and rain during the past week. He has had no
tuberculosis follow-up since 1988. The patient also has
long-standing lower back pain. He had a previous accident where he
was pinned between two cars at age 17. He has had pain in his
lower lumbar spine and occasional sharp pain that radiates down
both legs. He notes no weakness in his lower extremities , no
incontinence. This pain has increased substantially over the past
two months. The patient has noted an extensive psychiatric
history , evidently followed by Dr. Ruedy at the Acjames General Medical Center at the Albriel Health Care Services ( number 184-4108. ) The
patient was apparently diagnosed with paranoid schizoid
disorder vs. bipolar vs. schizophrenia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Tuberculosis , status post treatment
possibly for one year in 1987 , though no
confirmation of this has been found. 2 ) Psychiatric disorder. 3 )
Status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Prolixin 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )
Depakote 500 mg p.o. q. AM , 1 , 000 mg
p.o. q.h.s. 3 ) Cogentin 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 96.7 degrees ,
heart rate 100 , blood pressure 130/80. Head
and neck examination revealed that the pupils were equal , round and
reactive to light. Extraocular movements were intact. There was
no scleral icterus. Oropharynx was clear. Neck was supple without
any adenopathy , no jugular venous pressure was noted.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm with a two
out of six holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex , no S3 or S4.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen was obese ,
soft , non-tender , positive bowel sounds. Extremities revealed no
clubbing , cyanosis or edema noted. There were good peripheral
pulses. On rectal examination , the patient had good tone and was
guaiac negative. Neurologically , the patient was intact. On
admission , the patient received a chest x-ray which showed a
possible ground glass infiltrate in the right medial segment of the
upper lung field approximately 1 cm in size , otherwise clear lung
fields.
LABORATORY: The patient's laboratory examinations on admission
were all within normal limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for rule out
tuberculosis and was subsequently kept in the
respiratory isolation room and serial induced sputums were sent for
culture and stain and noted to be negative for acid fast
bacilli or other signs of tuberculosis. The patient was also noted to have no
further signs of hemoptysis while he was in the
hospital and therefore his history of hemoptysis has not been
verified. The patient was very cooperative while in the hospital
and showed no signs of being febrile or other signs of active
infection. No other signs of pulmonary
infection were identified that could account for hemoptysis.
It also did not appear that the patient had any form of possible lung
malignancy because he did not report weight loss or other suggestive features
To further work-up this up however , the patient
received a spiral CT scan of his chest which showed no focal
abnormalities and was notable for clear lung fields and no signs of
tuberculosis. As this was the case , the patient was subsequently
discharged home having been ruled out for tuberculosis. Notable
also , his PPD was negative at 48 hours with a positive mumps and
Candida anergy panel also suggestive of not having tuberculosis.
The patient was evaluated by Psychiatry while inhouse who was in
touch with his primary psychiatrist. The patient was continued on
his medications and noted to be quite stable while he was in the
hospital. He was deemed not medically able to make his own
decisions on admission and was therefore not allowed to leave
when the patient tried to leave on the night of admission. He was
very cooperative however over the course of his admission and was
followed by Psychiatry who have arranged follow-up with him upon
discharge. The patient was seen by Social Work who is actively
working with him to establish a shelter or other place to stay upon
discharge. The patient is amendable to this and anxious to receive
assistance. The patient was subsequently discharged on July , 1997 in good condition with the name and addresses of possible
places to stay and close follow-up with a social worker and his
psychiatrist.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Cogentin 0.1 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )
Depakote 100 mg p.o. q. AM , 200 mg p.o.
q.h.s. 3 ) Prolixin. 4 ) Tylenol p.r.n. back pain.

SERVICE: Orthopedic Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Infected left total hip replacement.
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: Removal of infected cemented left total hip
replacement with debridement of the hip and placement of
antibiotic-impregnated cement spacers on 2/16/05 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Beish is a 46-year-old female
with multiple medical problems who initially sustained a left hip
intertrochanteric fracture in October of 2004 and underwent an
ORIF with a DHS on 10/15/04 . The screw ultimately cut off and
she underwent removal of hardware on 9/28/04 with insertion of a
hemiarthroplasty with antibiotic beads. Her culture grew
coag-negative staph at that time and she was treated with six
weeks of IV antibiotics. After multiple hip aspirations to
confirm that the joint was no longer infected , she underwent a
left total hip replacement on 8/15/04 by Dr. Sweis . She ended
up being hospitalized in Gassonvenchand Pendinea Port from 3/5/05 to 8/16/05
with an E. coli bacteremia of unclear etiology , although it was
felt likely secondary to pyelonephritis. During that
hospitalization , she developed neck pain and was found to have
MRSA osteomyelitis at C6-C7. She underwent a C6-C7 I&D infusion
on 5/24/05 . She ultimately completed 16 weeks of IV vancomycin
for her MRSA spinal infection and at the completion of the
vancomycin therapy in February of 2005 , was started on minocycline
with a plan for a six-month treatment. She ultimately presented
to Dr. Amoako 's office on 7/13/05 with increasing left
groin/hip/lateral thigh pain over several months duration. Two
left hip aspirates in August , both grew MRSA , and as such , she
was scheduled for an explant of her left total hip replacement
with insertion of an antibiotic spacer on 2/16/05 .

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is single and lives alone in Utah She quit smoking tobacco 25 years ago and does not drink
alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for an obese
female , ambulates with a walker and an antalgic gait on the left.
She had mild tenderness with palpation in her mid cervical
spine. She had some mild distal left upper extremity and
proximal left lower extremity weakness. Gentle range of motion
of her left hip caused pain.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 1/9/05 for
initiation of IV antibiotic therapy at the request of the
Infectious Disease Service under the direction of Dr. Willy H Kirkey . Prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy , she had
blood cultures drawn , which ultimately showed no growth. Given
her neck pain and slight weakness , she also had an MRI of her
cervical spine performed , which showed no evidence of
osteomyelitis. Preoperatively , she was seen by both the
Infectious Disease Consult Service as well as the Medical Consult
Service. She was placed on a low-dose beta-blocker at the
recommendation of the Medical Consult Service. On the morning of
hospital day 2 , the beta-blocker was then discontinued under the
recommendation of the Medical Consult Service , as it was felt to
likely add little benefit. She did receive one dose of Coumadin
the night before surgery in preparation for DVT prophylaxis. She
was ultimately taken to the operating room on hospital day 2
where she underwent removal of her left total hip replacement
with irrigation , debridement and placement of an antibiotic
spacer. Estimated blood loss was 2.5 L. She received six units
of packed red blood cells , 9 L of crystalloid and 1 L of albumin.
Intraoperatively , gross pus was found. Intraoperative cultures
were sent , which ultimately grew MRSA. The patient received
perioperative stress dose hydrocortisone. Postoperatively , she
was taken to the surgical intensive care unit and intubated. Her
postoperative hematocrit was 29.2. The morning of postoperative
day 1 , the patient remained intubated but was able to open her
eyes and follow commands. She was neurovascularly intact in the
left lower extremity. She was treated with Lovenox only
initially given that she did not initially have an NG tube so
that p.o. medications including Coumadin could be administered.
She was continued on the vancomycin. The patient remained
intubated throughout the remainder of postoperative day 1 and
into the morning of postoperative day 2. Her hematocrit had
drifted down to 22.4 on postoperative day #1 for which she was
transfused two units with her hematocrit up to 26.2. She
continued to remain hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly
intact. An NG tube had been placed on postoperative day 1 , so
that p.o. medications including her Mestinon could be given for
her myasthenia gravis. She was ultimately extubated mid morning
on postoperative day 2. Her dressing was changed at that time
and the incision was clean and intact without any erythema. The
patient remained in the surgical ICU until postoperative day 3 ,
mainly with continued pain issues. She had been on a fentanyl
drip and was transitioned over to Dilaudid PCA. She was started
on clear diet on postoperative day 3 and transitioned over to
regular insulin sliding scale from the insulin drip that she had
been on to the early a.m. hours of postoperative day 3. Her
hematocrit remained stable in the high 20s. Her right IJ central
line was changed out over a wire under sterile technique in the
ICU on postoperative day 3 prior to transfer to the floor. She
was transferred to the floor in stable condition lat in the day
on postoperative day 3. She was taking p.o.'s at that time and
her home medications were restarted including her home
prednisone. Postoperative day 4 , pain continued to be her main
issue and she was seen by the Chronic Pain Service for
recommendations on transitioning her off of the high-dose
Dilaudid PCA. PCA was discontinued and she was started on p.r.n.
oxycodone in addition to her home a fentanyl patch and OxyContin.
Physical Therapy worked with the patient throughout her hospital
stay and were able to first sit her up on the edge of the bed on
postoperative day 4. She continued to remain afebrile ,
hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly intact throughout the
remainder of her hospitalization. Her hematocrit was stable in
the high 20s. She had a PICC line placed on postoperative day 5
for administration of her long-term IV vancomycin. The Pain
Service continued to see the patient and titrate her pain
medications with gradually improving effect. The Foley was
discontinued the morning of postoperative day 6 , as the patient
began to be able to move around a little more easily. By
postoperative day 7 , she was more comfortable , was tolerating a
regular diet and voiding q. shift without a Foley. She was
afebrile , hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly intact. She
was continued on both Coumadin and Lovenox given that her INR was
still not therapeutic. She should continue on the Coumadin with
a Lovenox bridge until the INR is therapeutic. The patient was
cleared for transfer to rehab on postoperative day 7 by the
Orthopedic Infectious Disease and Physical Therapy services. She
was accepted for transfer to the Biger Community Hospital in Ee ,

cardiac cath 5/10/01 showed patent D1 stent and unchanged coronaries
since last cath 99
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
50 yo with CAD s/p PTCA with stent to 1st diag in 1999 , also with
chronic lower back pain with intrathecal morphine pump. Presents with
chest pain in context of 12 hours nausea/vomiting/dry heave likely
secondary to morphine withdrawal from malfunctioning pump. Chest pain
relieved with SL NTG x3. Enzyme leak , troponin 1.3 at outside hospital
--> NQWMI. Pt transferred for cath to evaluate stent. Cath 5/10/01
showed patent D1 stent , 50% LAD , 60% PDA with likely accelerated
idioventricular rhythm post cath. He was transferred to cards
for evaluation of rhythm and optimization of cardiac management.
Pt has been asymptomatic on morphine PCA ( pending arrival of
intrathecal pump infusion per pain service ). HTN was controlled with
clonidine , and his ECG normalized. Chest pain was thought
to be secondary to increased demand during acute withdrawal. Will
Pump was refilled per pain service , and his cardiac regimen was
optimized. Outpatient cardiology follow up with stress test to risk
stratify was arranged. Patient's urine output was marginal on 3/16/01 .
He was hydrated with modest response. BUN and creatinine were stable.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Call your doctor or go to emergency room if you develop chest pain ,
lightheadedness , worsening shortness of breath , or palpitations. Follow
-up appointments have ben scheduled for cardiology , cholesterol
management , and primary care.

Discharge Date: 2/27/2000
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Weakness , shortness of breath , worsening over one
month.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: THis is a 71 year old male with
diabetes mellitus , asthma , history of
guaiac positive stool , history of angina now with increased
weakness and shortness of breath progressive over one month. He
has required increased metered dose inhalers for ""asthma"" over the
past two weeks and has become progressively short of breath over
one block where he used to be able to walk ""all the way into town.""
He denied dizziness , myalgias , no fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting
or diarrhea but did complain of a decreased appetite and ten pound
weight loss over the past month. He said he has had black stools
times three weeks with constipation and said that he stopped his
iron pills about a month ago because he just had too many pills to

per rectum. He denied cough , rhinorrhea. He did have a sore
throat but no recent contact and got his Pneumovax and flu shot
this year. The patient denied any orthopnea or paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea or peripheral edema. The patient was last
admitted in 4/10 for malaise and shortness of breath and found to
have a right lower lobe pneumonia at the time , also in atrial
fibrillation and flutter , hyperglycemia and guaiac positive stools
attributed to diverticulosis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY; 1. Significant for history of angina.
The patient had an exercise echocardiogram
in 2/14 which showed normal systolic function and no wall motion
abnormalities , no ischemia. He went three minutes and stopped
secondary to fatigue with max heart rate of 79 which is 52% of
predicted. He was beta blocked with blood pressure of 130/80 and
no ST changes. 2. Diabetes mellitus , 3. Asthma. In 11/1 , PFTs
showed FEC 88% of predicted , FEV of 74% of predicted , FEV1/FEC

functional , residual capacity and 83% of predicted. 4. Sigmoid
diverticulosis/polyps , 5. History of renal stones , 6. History of
atrial fibrillation and flutter in 4/10 when admitted with
pneumonia. 7. Ataxic gait and intermittent dementia noted on the
4/10 admission. 8. Guaiac positive stool noted on the 4/10
admission. 9. Also , history of gastritis and history of GI bleed
at Tech County Hospital in 1/24 .  Attempt was made to gather
information at discharge from Straub University Medical Center but we were
unable to obtain records. 10. History of left hydrocele. 11.
Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. 12. Anxiety disorder.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: The patient said he had some operation for
kidney stones.
ALLERGIES: Unknown.
MEDICATIONS: Humulin NPH 20 b.i.d. , Isordil 20 b.i.d. , Cardizem 30
t.i.d. , Mevacor 20 q day , Klonopin 0.5 b.i.d. , Paxil
20 q day , Albuterol two puffs q.i.d. , Azmacort four puffs b.i.d.
and Zantac 150 b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Positive tobacco pack per day , ETOH occasionally
and he lives with his wife. He doesn't work.
FAMILY HISTORY: Unknown.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile at
97.8 with heart rate of 80 , blood pressure
110/50 , lying down and sitting up heart rate of 88 and blood
pressure of 120/50. He was satting 97% on room air. GENERAL: He
was awake , alert , Spanish speaking male , poor historian. HEENT:
NC/AT , EOMI , PERRLA. OROPHARYNX: Negative with moist mucous
membranes. NECK: He had no JVP. CORONARY: Regular rate , no
murmurs , rubs or gallops. LUNGS; Crackles bilaterally at bases.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , tympanic with good bowel sounds and no
peritoneal signs. RECTAL: Showed guaiac positive brown stool.
EXTREMITIES: Warm , dry but poorly palpable peripheral pulses.
Cranial nerves examination showed II/XII grossly intact and motor
and sensory exams were without gross deficit.
LABORATORY: His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with first degree
AV block , rate of 78 , PR of 212 , QRS of 96 and QT 448
with axis of 57. He had some flat Ts in AVL and T wave inversion
in V1. His chest x-ray had no infiltrate , no effusion and no
evidence of failure. Laboratory revealed sodium of 138 , potassium
of 4.1 , chloride 103 and bicarbonate of 25 with BUN of 17 and
creatinine 1.2. His baseline was 0.7 in 4/10 .  Glucose was 186 and
anion gap of 10. He had a white count of 8.2 , hematocrit of 17.9
which his baseline was 39.5 in 4/10 , platelets of 280 and MCV of
68. He had 66 neutrophils , 21 lymphs and 8 monos and PT of 12.1 ,
PTT of 21.3 and INR of 1.0. His CK was 47 and Troponin was 21.9.
His amylase was 28 and lipase was 187.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By problem list: Heme: He had a hematocrit of
17.9 down from baseline of 39.5. He was
transfused three packed red blood cells and his hematocrit
responded appropriately. It was 34.5 by the day of discharge. He
also had iron studies sent off that showed a total iron binding
capacity of 324 and ferritin of 20 consistent with iron deficiency
anemia. He was restarted on Niferex.
GI: Given this guaiac positive stool and history of guaiac
positive stool in 1999 , he was thought to have an acute on chronic
GI bleed questionably secondary to diverticulosis or cancer. He
also has history of gastritis. We kept him NPO. GI consult was
obtained. He underwent initially an esophagogastroduodenoscopy
which was completely normal. Esophagus had no varices , no
esophagitis. Stomach was normal; no ulcer , no erosion or end NSAID
gastropathy. His duodenum to D3 was normal with small
periampullary diverticulum. Colonoscopy was then performed which
found sigmoid diverticulosis , 4 millimeter non-bleeding sessile
polyp which was removed by snare cautery and some mild oozing after
the polypectomy but good hemostasis was achieved. Small , internal
hemorrhoids were present but no active bleeding sites were found.
On pathology , it was found to be a hyperplastic polyp. GI team
recommended small bowel follow through to rule out small bowel
source for bleeding as an outpatient. The patient was kept on his
Zantac 150 b.i.d. for history of gastritis. The patient was sent
home on Tylenol for pain and told to avoid taking aspirin or any
other NSAIDs given his GI bleed.
Renal: Creatinine was 1.2 on admission. His baseline was 0.9. He
received some IV fluids as he was NPO for his GI studies and his
creatinine came down to 0.9. So , it was likely that he was
slightly volume depleted on admission.
Cardiovascular: The patient had a history of angina but no recent
chest pain and no cardiac complaints. With his hematocrit of 18 ,
he had a flat CK and Troponin of 0.19 and had no further cardiac
issues during this hospital course. He was kept off aspirin given
his GI bleeding. THe patient also has hypertension and was on
Isordil and Cardizem for that. His blood pressure meds were held
initially on admission and were re-added back at the time of
discharge as well as his Mevacor.
Endocrine: The patient was maintained on his Humulin NPH and
covered with sliding scale during this admission. His blood sugars
remained in the 160 to 180 range.
Pulmonary: The patient was kept on his Albuterol and Azmacort
metered dose inhalers and by the time of discharge , was without
wheezes and satting well at 96% on room air.
Neuro: The patient was kept on his Klonopin and Paxil for anxiety.
Fluid , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient was started on
magnesium oxide for low magnesium during his hospital course.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Are as follows: 1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4
p.r.n. headache , 2. Isordil 20 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , 3. Cardizem 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , 4. Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q day ,

ATTENDING: LAZARO HINSHAW MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: CHF exacerbation.
LIST OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES:
1. CHF.
2. CAD status post CABG in 1988.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency.
4. Type II diabetes.
5. Glaucoma.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. History of bowel resection for diverticulitis.
8. Question of TIA in the past with right-sided numbness.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Elter is an 83-year-old Spanish-speaking female with history
of CAD , distant three-vessel CABG , CRI , NSTEMI in 10/29 ,
treated with just medications , EF of 75% in 10/29 , who
presented one week of PND , dyspnea on exertion , and chest
heaviness. This chest sensation did not radiate and was
unassociated with nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis or
lightheadedness. The patient also had cough with green sputum x1
year , no fevers or chills , no sick contacts. EMS gave Lasix and
Nitrospray. In the ED , she was briefly on a nonrebreather mask ,
responded to 80 mg of IV Lasix , K was 5.8 and got Kayexalate.
She became comfortable , sitting at 75 degrees , chest pain-free.
Also , noted no change in bowel/bladder habits , no change in meds
and no dietary changes. She had positive progressive lower
extremity edema x2 weeks.
ALLERGIES:
Lisinopril leading to hyperkalemia.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Retired textile worker from Ral , lives with daughter , and is
Spanish speaking.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
Aspirin , metoprolol , allopurinol , valsartan , glipizide , Lipitor ,
and nifedipine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Temperature was 96 , pulse was 70 , blood pressure was 148/56 ,
respiratory rate was 20 , and saturating 100% on nonrebreather and
eventually in the high 90s on a couple of liters of oxygen. In
general , she was in no acute distress , JVP 12 cm with positive
hepatojugular reflux , soft bibasilar rales , regular rate and
rhythm , 2-3/6 systolic murmur , loudest at the left upper sternal
border , ( mild AS on echo from 1/26 ). Abdomen was soft ,
nontender , and nondistended , bowel sounds positive. Extremities
showed 3+ bilateral pitting ankle edema with weak distal pulses.
LABORATORY DATA:
Showed a sodium of 129 , potassium of 5.7 , creatinine of 2.8 with
a baseline anywhere between 2 and 3.5 , cardiac enzymes negative
x1 , BNP of 1448. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 73 , septal
Qs , QTC of 456. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , small bilateral
effusions , no infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: Rule out MI by enzymes and EKG
with a full set negative. Continued her aspirin , beta-blockers ,
and statin for coronary artery disease. Pump: CHF flare with
elevated BNP , volume overload , diuresed with Lasix and Diuril;
salt/water restricted , kept strict I/O with moderate diuresis.
After load reduced with ARB , weaned off her previous home calcium
channel blocker. Rhythm: Telemetry showing transient new atrial
fibrillation with a maximum heart rate of less than 70 , which
spontaneously resolved after several hours. An echo showed
stable aortic stenosis without any acute worsening. She also had
a rhythm strip on the telemetry showing a regular focus of
ventricular ectopy , also spontaneously resolving. This was
treated with continued beta-blockers. At the time of discharge ,
she was in normal sinus rhythm.
2. Renal: Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine
of 2.8 to 3.3 , with acute worsening in-house , most likely
secondary to over diuresis with Diuril/Lasix , also some prerenal
component secondary to fluid restriction. Her potassium was
elevated initially , got Kayexalate , and then was low/low normal
after Lasix. Creatinine peaked at 4.1 , Lasix and ARBs were held.
Urine study showed a prerenal component , also showed some
proteinuria. Her creatinine eventually improved to 3.3 , and her
bicarb improved from 17 to 23 with the closing of her acid gap
from 17 to 11. Potassium was 4.5 at the time of discharge. The
patient will need to follow up with Dr. Dasgupta , her
nephrologist , and she was set up for an appointment on 2/18/04 .
3. Endocrine: DM-2 , she was treated with regular sliding scale
insulin with good blood sugar control. Her glipizide was held
given that her creatinine clearance was worsening. We did not
restart her glipizide at the time of discharge until follow up
with Dr. Ohlenbusch given her overall worsening creatinine
clearance.
4. Rheumatology: History of gout , change her allopurinol to
q.72h. from q.o.d. secondary to creatinine clearance. She did
complain of some left heel pain and left foot pain , thought
secondary to her gout. This improved at the time of discharge.
5. Heme: Hematocrit dropped from 29 to 25 , her guaiac was
negative on the 2/5/04 . She also has epistaxis at night for
four to five days. She was placed on humidified room air given
nasal saline sprays and Afrin. Because of her coronary artery
disease , she was transfused total of 3 units over the course of
her hospital stay to keep her hematocrit greater than 30. She
was given Lasix after her transfusions. An ENT evaluation showed
a small area of ulceration in her posterior nasopharynx , which
will need a follow up possibly with a CT as an outpatient to rule
out malignancy. At the time of her discharge , her hematocrit was
36. Initially , Coumadin was started given her new onset of
atrial fibrillation. After consideration of risks versus benefit
of anticoagulation , her transient atrial fibrillation which
resolved spontaneously , it was decided to continue any further
anticoagulation and send her out just on aspirin. She did
receive subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis while in-house.
GI: The patient initially had some constipation , which was
relieved with stool softeners. The patient's stool was guaiac
negative. The patient received the PPI.
DISPOSITION:
The daughter who is the patient's healthcare proxy was made aware
of the patient's status and disposition throughout her hospital
course. A PT evaluation indicated that the patient would benefit
from a period of re-stay at rehab , however the patient family
preferred the patient to go home and was constant that they would
be able to provide 24/7 support over the next week as the patient
will need help in navigating her home which included two flights
of stairs. PT was comfortable with this and this was explained
thoroughly to the patient and her family with regard to the risks
versus benefit of going home versus going to rehab. The patient
will follow up with Dr. Heingartner in one to two weeks , which has
not been scheduled , and with Dr. Tsunoda with Nephrology which
has been scheduled for 2/18/04 . Communication was made with Dr.
Smyth regarding her admission here. The patient will be sent
home with VNA support to follow up on her weights and fluid
status , she will also have home physical therapy.

Discharge Date: 6/7/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
PROBLEM LIST:
1. HYPERTENSION.
2. NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
3. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
4. PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE.
5. PARKINSONISM.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 72 year old woman with a
history of hypertension , non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus , high cholesterol , who presents with
chest pain. She is status post a coronary artery bypass grafting
in 1992 and catheterizations in 1993 and 1998 and has had a long
history of stable angina. This angina is approximately once per
week , always responds to one sublingual nitroglycerin. It is
usually diffuse pain in the front of her chest and across her back.
The morning of admission she experienced shortness of breath and
chest pain which decreased after one sublingual nitroglycerin.
After lunch she had a repeated episode which was not relieved by
nitroglycerin. She came to the emergency room at the Choharlbull Community Hospital .  Electrocardiogram there showed lateral changes.
The patient has been recently undergoing a work up for a weight
loss of 40-50 pounds over only a couple of months. An ERCP in
5/12 showed narrowing in the common bile duct. This narrow was
stented and brushings were taken. These brushings were sent for
cytology and pathological analysis and they were not diagnostic.
This course status post ERCP was complicated by pancreatitis.
Echocardiogram in 7/16/98 showed an ejection fraction of 40-45%
with 2+ mitral regurgitation. The most recent catheterization in
1998 showed the SVG to OM1 graft patent , the SVG to RCA graft
patent , LAD was totally occluded , the RCA was 40-50% occluded , PDA
had an ostial 80% lesion that was rotabladed. This was complicated
by a perforation. She had a short stay in the CCU after this
procedure.
ALLERGIES: Dilaudid which makes her dizzy.

changes. She had an exercise MIBI. On the exercise she went on a
modified Bruce for 6 minutes 25 seconds with a maximum heart rate
of 150. There were nondiagnostic ST changes during exercise and
she stopped due to fatigue. MIBI images showed the following:
There was a mixed transmural and nontransmural myocardial
infarction involving four cardiac segments in the inferior lateral
and lateral wall. There was moderate peri-infarct ischemia
involving additional segments. There was mild to moderate
ischemia involving three cardiac segments in the high lateral wall.
There was mild anterior septal ischemia. She went for cardiac
catheterization which showed the following: A right dominant
system with a left anterior descending that had lesions that were
40% and 50%. Diagonal had a 70% lesion that was stented to 20%.
Left circ was occluded with saphenous vein graft to the OM patent
and the saphenous vein graft to the RCA patent. There was in
addition a large 10 millimeter pseudoaneurysm at the site of the
previous PDA rotablation which was thrombosed with a coil. The
procedure was accomplished without complications. She had some
mild chest pain after the procedure which was reproducible with

OTHER PROBLEMS:
1. HISTORY OF MORBID OBESITY.
2. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA.
3. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
4. HISTORY OF CELLULITIS.
5. EJECTION FRACTION OF 40 PERCENT WITH LEFT ATRIAL ENLARGEMENT.
6. URINARY TRACT INFECTION.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Mr. Foller is a very pleasant 59 year-old man who
presents with a history of morbid obesity ,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ejection fraction of 40 percent
who presents status post a fall and with increasing urinary
frequency.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Neilsen has morbid obesity and is
currently at a weight of 450 pounds
and also has a history of fluctuating weight with decrease in
weight to 200 pounds with dieting. He also has obstructive sleep
apnea on continuous positive airway pressure , history of atrial
fibrillation and is not anticoagulated per his primary care
physician. He has a mildly decreased ejection fraction with mitral
regurgitation and a history of cellulitis. He presented in 4/5
for a short stay unit admission with progressive lower extremity
weakness bilaterally and urinary incontinence. It was felt at that
time by neurosurgery and neurology to be multifactorial and no
consistent with disk or cord impingement. There was a work up at
that time including B12 , ANA and HIV all of which were negative.
EMG showed decreased recruitment in the tibialis anterior and
gastrocnemius bilaterally. His rectus femoris were normal
bilaterally. He was treated for a urinary tract infection at that
time with Bactrim for resolution of his incontinence and he was not
anticoagulated by his primary care physician. Since discharge he
noted continued right greater than left lower extremity weakness
otherwise at baseline health until two weeks prior to admission
when he noted some lumbar and sacral pain , nonradiating , worse
while moving his right leg. Over the past few days he noted also
increasing urinary frequency without burning or urinary
incontinence , no fever or chills and no costovertebral angle
tenderness or pain. No bowel incontinence or perianal numbness or
pain. The night of admission , at 7:30 p.m. while getting up from a
chair , his right leg gave out and he fell to the floor ""gracefully""
without injury or head trauma , no loss of consciousness. He had no
preceeding dizziness , chest pain , shortness of breath or
paresthesia and presented to the Emergency Room at the Onven County Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.

illicit drug use including LSD. No history of
tobacco use , currently. Rare alcohol use and lives with his wife
of 15 years.
FAMILY HISTORY: Varicose veins , early coronary artery disease in a
brother who was 50 years old. His parents passed
away in a motor vehicle accident. No history of clots.
PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient is a morbidly obese man in no acute
distress , sitting in a chair. Vital signs showed
temperature of 97.1 , pulse 80 , blood pressure 148/90 , oxygen
saturation 96% on room air with a respiratory rate of 20. HEENT:
Obese neck. Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodation. No conjunctivitis. Oropharynx is clear. Mucous
membranes were moist. Jugular venous distention not appreciated.
CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: II/VI systolic
ejection murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. Irregular ,
irregular rhythm. No S3 or S4. ABDOMEN: Obese , soft and
nontender. ABDOMEN: Obese , soft and nontender. Nondistended with
positive bowel sounds and a significant rash of his pannus.
RECTAL: Strong rectal tone. EXTREMITIES: Right calf was with a
shallow , erythematous dry ulcer which was chronic with changes
consistent with venous insufficiency and varicose veins.
NEUROLOGICAL: Nonfocal. Strength in the right hip flexor was
decreased to 4/5 and on the right his plantar dorsiflexion strength
was 4/5 bilaterally. Sensation was grossly intact to touch.
Finger-to-nose was normal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , chloride
102 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 20 ,
creatinine 0.9 , glucose 101. He had a white blood cell count of 9
with 76 polys , 4 bands , hematocrit 37.6 and a platelet count of
236. His urinalysis showed 3+ blood and positive leukocyte
esterase with 15-20 white blood cells , one plus bacteria and one
plus squamous cells.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Neurological: The neurology service came by
to see the patient in the Emergency Room and felt
that there was no acute neurologic change but if the patient was
unable to walk he should be sent to rehabilitation. They saw no
new acute change and he should continue to be followed by neurology
in clinic.
2. Cardiac: He does have a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and echocardiogram with decreased ejection fraction
was noted previously. He will be started on a trial of Lasix p.o.
q day to decrease his peripheral edema to help him with
rehabilitation and his primary care physician will continue to
follow him for his atrial fibrillation and he does elect not to
anticoagulate him at the moment though Coumadin should be a
consideration given his risk of stroke.
3. Skin care: Right calf demonstrates a pressure ulcer and the
patient should apply Nystatin powder for his pannus rash.
4. Infectious disease: His urinary tract infection will be
treated with seven days of Bactrim and follow urine cultures.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient will be discharged to
rehabilitation care for leg
strengthening.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV. The patient was felt to be high risk for CAD on presentation
with her ESRD and DM. Will typical chest pain and a positive troponin
she was felt to have NSTEMI and was immediately placed on Reopro and
Heparin gtt , as well as nitro gtt for BP and pain control. She did well
overnight and went to hemodialysis and then directly to catheterization
the next morning. She was found to have a 70% LAD lesion which was
stented with a DES. She was started on ACEI , lipitor , ASA , plavix and
her oupatient lopressor was increased. She did well post-cath ,
complaining only of mild numbness/tingling in the lateral R thigh thought
to be a mild compression neuropathy from laying flat for hours post-cath.
Her groin was stable without hematoma and she had good peripheral
pulses. She was discharged to home to continue her cardiac medications
and follow-up with her cardiologist , Dr. Madaffari , and her PCP. Her BP was
well controlled and she had no rhythm issues throughout the
hospitalization.
2. ESRD. She was followed by the renal team throughout hospitalization
for hemodialysis and had no issues. Per the renal team she received
pre-cath mucomyst as she still makes some urine , and she was started on
lisinopril. She continued on nephrocaps. She will continue HD at
Paz General Hospital every MWF after discharge.
3. GOUT: She was continued on her outpatient allopurinol.
4. DM. She was continued on her outpatient insulin regimen with good
FSBG control.
5. COPD. She was continued on her outpatient atrovent with PRN
albuterol and she has oxygen at home.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your chest pain was caused by decreased flow to your heart muscle which
was corrected with a metal stent to keep the blood vessel in your heart
open. It is VERY important that you NEVER miss a day of your new
medication PLAVIX because this medication keeps that metal stent open.
Call Dr. Brownlie or Dr. Wendelberger if you have any chest pain , shortness of
breath or any other worrisome symptoms. Keep eating a heart-healthy
diet , gradually increase your exercise back to your baseline and take all
of your med

aortic valve replacement to be admitted on September , 2001. He
has had an echocardiogram which demonstrates severe aortic stenosis
with mitral annular calcification , left ventricular hypertrophy and
1+ aortic insufficiency , also mild tricuspid regurgitation and
ejection fraction of 55%.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus , depression , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , and gout.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Simvastatin. 2 ) Lopressor 50 mg

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old Native
American female with history of
diabetes , hypertension , chronic low back pain who had a syncopal
episode on the night prior to admission. The patient was at home
sitting on the bed and go up to go outside. The patient felt pain
in her lower back and numbness and tingling in legs similar to her
chronic low back pain. The patient walked to the top of the stairs
to go down and last remembered grabbing onto the bannister. The
patient passed out and fell down 17 stairs. The patient does not
remember falling and according to her family , she was not
unconscious for more than 2 to 3 seconds at the bottom of the
stairs. When the patient woke up , she states she felt her heart
racing and was diaphoretic with shortness of breath. The patient
denies preceding chest pain , dizziness , vertigo or any other
symptoms prior to her syncopal episode. The patient also denies
headache , vomiting , loss of bowel and bladder function. The
patient states that she has passed out one or two times in the past
but does not remember the circumstances surrounding the events.
The patient went to the CENTCOUNT SI GENERAL HOSPITAL clinic the next day and from there was
sent to the emergency department. The patient states that she has
chest tightness/pressure on occasion that is often associated with
shortness of breath and diaphoresis. She states the pain radiates
to her arms on occasions. She experiences this pain both at rest
and with exertion. She states she has occasional leg swelling but
denies orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The patient's
risk factors for coronary artery disease include hypertension ,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and strong family history of
heart disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As stated above.
ALLERGIES: The patient has had a reaction to contrast dye in the
past that resulted in hives. THe patient has
questionable allergy to an unknown antibiotic which causes a rash.
The patient is also reportedly allergic to Bactrim.
MEDICATIONS: Lopid 600 b.i.d. , Axid 150 b.i.d. , Captopril 75
b.i.d. , Cardizem 180 q d , Lasix 40 q d , Insulin 70/30
80 in the am and 40 in the pm.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a housekeeper originally from
Ponce Stertuc Mode She denies tobacco or alcohol use. The
patient lives with her son who is blind and also her granddaughter.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's father died of MI at age 81; mother
died of MI at age 73. The patient has a brother
who died of MI at age 38.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is comfortable in no acute
distress. It is noted that the patient is
morbidly obese. Vital signs; Pulse 120 , blood pressure 180/80 ,
temperature 99.5 , respiratory rate 16 , O2 sats 96% at room air.
HEENT: Pupils are equal , round and reactive to light; Extraocular
muscles are intact. Oropharynx is clear. Mucous membranes are
moist. NECK: Supple without lymphadenopathy. CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 ,
S2 no murmurs , rubs or gallops appreciated. The patient has
diminished dorsalis pedis pulse on the left side; otherwise ,
peripheral pulses are intact. CHEST: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally; crackles bilaterally at the bases. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
soft , non-tender. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis or edema
noted. There is a 1 cm abrasion at the right shin , bruising over
the right shin and dorsal aspect of the foot. NEURO: Alert and
oriented times three. There is a right lower facial droop;
otherwise cranial nerves II through XII intact. Motor is 5/5 in
all extremities; sensory is intact throughout to light touch.
LABORATORY: Sodium 138 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 100 , bicarb 26 ,
BUN 16 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 305. WBC 12.7 ,
hematocrit 36.1 , platelets 327. Troponin I is 0; CK 216. Chest
x-ray is negative. CT of head is negative. EKG shows normal sinus
rhythm at rate of 117. There is a right bundle branch block and
left anterior fascicular block present. There are also Q waves in
lateral leads V4 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the general medical
service for evaluation of syncope. She was
monitored over the weekend and no arrhythmias were picked up on
cardiac monitor. The patient underwent echocardiography which
showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of
80%. There were no wall motion abnormalities. There was also noted
mild left atrial enlargement and mild aortic valve sclerosis. Due
to the worrisome nature of patient's history of angina-like
symptoms , she went directly to cardiac catheterization , which
revealed heavily calcified LAD and RCA. The LAD showed proximal
stenosis of 30 to 40% , circumflex showed proximal stenosis of 30%
and the RCA showed proximal stenosis of 30%. It was felt that this
represented mild CAD and most likely could not explain the source
of the patient's syncopal episode. The patient also underwent
electrophysiology study which showed no evidence for ventricular
arrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias as cause of syncope. The patient
continued to have no arrhythmic events on cardiac monitor
throughout her hospital stay. The patient tolerated the cardiac
cath well and did well during the postprocedure period. The
patient's diltiazem was discontinued thinking that it may
contribute to heart block given the fact that she has a
bifascicular block. THe patient was started on nifedipine XL. The
patient was discharged home with close follow-up with her primary
care physician , Dr. Mendoca .
MEDICATIONS: On discharge , Captopril 75 b.i.d. , Nifedipine XL 90 q
d , Lopid 600 b.i.d. , Axid 150 b.i.d. , Lasix 40 q d ,

ATTENDING: ROMAN DAMIAN GIRGIS MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: CHF exacerbation.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CHF exacerbation.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old
gentleman with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with a
baseline ejection fraction recently estimated at 10-15% in
September of this year. History of polysubstance abuse including
IV drug abuse , internasal cocaine , history of hepatitis C ,
history of depression , celiac sprue , history of insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus , chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline
creatinine ranging from 1.8-2.4 , history of bipolar disorder ,
history of non-ST elevation MI with a negative stress test in
10/29 , who presents on May , 2005 after sustaining a fall
at home. Patient lives on the third floor of his building and
has difficulty secondary to dyspnea on exertion with ambulation
up steps. Per patient , patient was walking up steps and felt
increasing dyspneic and secondary experience a fall. EMS was
notified and patient was brought to the Hey County Hospital .  Upon presentation to the Sman Hospital , patient reports
other additional symptoms of CHF exacerbation including
progressive dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and cough productive of yellow phlegm dating back to most
recent discharge from hospital on March , 2004 when patient
was admitted for similar complaint of CHF exacerbation. Patient
with multiple , multiple admissions in the last year to two years
secondary to CHF exacerbation with exacerbations felt to be
secondary to medication noncompliance as well as dietary
discretion.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As stated.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include Lasix 100 mg t.i.d. , Regular
Insulin sliding scale , lisinopril 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. , Ativan 0.5 mg
q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , spironolactone
25 mg p.o. q.d. , amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o.
q.d. , Lantus 15 units SC q.h.s. , Protonix 400 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: Patient with allergies to multiple medications
including aspirin , codeine , tetracycline , NSAIDs , ibuprofen ,
Benadryl , Compazine , penicillin. Additionally of note , patient
should not receive beta-blockage given history of cocaine abuse
and ongoing cocaine use.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient lives on the third floor of his
apartment building. Former tobacco user. Patient refused to
discuss polysubstance abuse at the time of admission.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
VITAL SIGNS ON ADMISSION: Patient was afebrile at 96 , pulse of
84 , blood pressure 150/99 , respiratory rate of 20 , O2 sat 100% on
room air. Patient was quite combative on admission , though it is
unclear exactly the etiology of the patient's agitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for elevated
jugular venous pressure with pulsation observant the ear at 90
degrees , estimated approximately 18 cm of water. Patient
addition with rales approximately one-half to two-thirds up
bilaterally on chest exam. Cardiac exam: Patient regular rate
and rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops were appropriated.
Patient's lower extremities were felt to be warm and
well-perfused with 2+ lower extremity edema to the hips
bilaterally.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for sodium of 127 ,
hyponatremia felt to be secondary to chronic CHF exacerbation.
Potassium of 5.1 , bicarb of 19 , creatinine elevated at 2.6 up
from baseline of 1.8 , glucose elevated at 377 , hematocrit stable
at 34.5 and BNP was recorded on admission at greater than assay.
EKG on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate
of approximately
80 with T-wave inversion in V5-V6 which were similar to prior
echocardiograms. Chest x-ray obtained on admission revealed
pulmonary vascular congestion with flank pulmonary edema and
bilateral pleural effusions. No infiltrate was appreciated. As
such , patient was admitted for evaluation and management of CHF
exacerbation. CHF was felt to be secondary to medication and
dietary noncompliance as previously mentioned.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: Patient with no evidence for chest pain or
ischemic injury. At the time of admission , CHF exacerbation not
felt to be due to recurrent ischemia but rather medication
indiscretion. Of note , patient with multiple prior troponin
leaks ranging from 0.10 to 0.12 on prior admissions. Not felt to
be secondary to ischemia necessarily but rather due secondary to
elevated filling pressures.
B. Pump: Patient with decompensated heart failure on admission
not felt to be in a low cardiac output state but rather just
volume overloaded. Patient was subsequently diuresed using both
IV Lasix and p.o. torsemide. At the time of discharge , patient
felt to be relatively euvolemic though will likely require
further outpatient evaluation and ongoing diuresis given his
continued congestive heart failure. Patient with difficulty
adhering to a 2 liter per day fluid-restriction diet , would
recommend further nutritional outpatient evaluation and
counseling regarding his fluid status given poor cardiac
function. At the time of discharge , patient on 100 mg of
torsemide b.i.d. with relatively good urine output and I/O of
approximately negative 0.5 to 1 kg per day , would recommend
intensive outpatient CHF management including multidisciplinary
approach using heart failure nursing. Patient advised to use
scale and record daily weight , that there have been issues in the
past with compliance. Additionally , patient's Aldactone was
discontinued secondary to hyperkalemia and instead patient was
started on Isordil/hydralazine for hemodynamic support.
C. Rhythm: Patient stable from the perspective , maintained on
tele monitoring with no events over his hospital course.
2. Renal: Patient with acute renal failure on admission with
creatinine elevated to 2.6. With ongoing diuresis and correction
of volume overload , patient's creatinine corrected to a baseline
value. At the time of discharge , patient's creatinine was 2.0.
Recommend rehab monitoring of renal function including creatinine
and BUN every three days until patient on a stable dose of
torsemide and felt to be euvolemic , given concern or risk for
acute renal failure during ongoing diuresis.
3. Endocrine: Patient with a history of insulin-dependent
diabetes maintained on Lantus with Regular Insulin sliding scale
per outpatient regimen.
4. Psych: Patient with a history of bipolar disorder ,
maintained on Depakote. Additionally , patient with a history of
insomnia managed with Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
Patient with a history of bipolar disorder treated with Depakote
per outpatient regimen.
MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: Include hydralazine 10 mg p.o.
q.i.d. with a hold parameter for systolic blood pressure less
than 100 mmHg. Regular Insulin sliding scale , Isordil 10 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , multivitamin , Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q.d. , torsemide 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. given aspirin allergy ,
Depakote ER 250 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. with
appropriate substitution for formulary PPI , Lantus
20 units SC q.h.s. P.r.n. medications to include Tylenol , Ativan
0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , Atrovent neb 0.5 mg neb
t.i.d. p.r.n. shortness of breath , Ultram 50 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n.
pain.
ONGOING MEDICAL ISSUES AND OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
1. Patient will require further aggressive outpatient CHF
management including ongoing diuresis using p.o. torsemide.
Patient does put out well to p.o. torsemide , though of note he
does have compliance issues with regards to daily fluid intake.
2. Additionally , would recommend further titration of
hydralazine and Isordil to maximize hemodynamic support.
3. Additionally , given hyperkalemia on admission with peak
potassium reaching 6.0 , patient's lisinopril and spironolactone
held at the time of discharge. Would recommend reinstitution of
patient's ACE inhibitor particularly as an outpatient with
low-dose lisinopril perhaps starting at 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. with
intensive monitoring of potassium.
4. Additionally , would recommend further diabetic teaching as an
outpatient given patient's poor compliance.
5. Strongly feel patient would benefit from involvement in a CHF
program either through Gon Ce or
through other program.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT: Patient to follow up with primary care
physician , Dr. Marion Salser , at the Pressou Healthcare Center .  Please call for follow-up appointment.

************** Hospital Course***************
1 ) ISCHEMIA: pt with prior CAD/stent , likely angina 2nd to demand
ischemia on decompenasted HF. cont meds , pt not on Plavix on
admission. Doubt primary angina as couse of CHF/RHF.
2 ) PUMP: Pt with ?dyastolic HF with
acute decomp/exacerbation ( with dietary
indiscretion )- as well as renal failure as poss source of
volume overload. Change to IV lasix 100 BID and
strict I/Os , weights. October Pt has responded to BMP diuresis in past.
Restarted here on BMP w/ limited response. Pt achieved -500 ml qd but
continued to have weight gain. I suspect that fluids were not being acc
urately accounted for. At this time patient is no longer being effect
ively diuresed and will require dialysis for volume overload in a
short period of time.
3 ) RHYTHM: No signs of arhtymias
4 ) RENAL: PT with stage 4 CRI and nephrotic
synd. May be volume overload 2nd to renal failure
in addition to CHF decomp/exacer. Cr. 4 at admission but elevated to
5.3. Given Pt's current condition , dialysis seems
imminent. October Pt went for vein mapping but pt remained uncertain if
he will accept dialysis as a treatment option. At time of d/c
creatnine now 5.0. Pt will have creatnine checked in 2 days and
called in to following physician. Will HD plan accordingly.

Discharge Date: 9/13/1995
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Unstable angina.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Brincefield is a 59 year old gentleman
with a history of coronary artery
disease , status post PTCA in 1990 who present with recurrent
uncontrolled chest pain. He had a positive exercise tolerance test
in October of 1990 which led to a catheterization which showed 100
% proximal right coronary artery and 60 % OMB-2. He had successful
PTCA of his right coronary artery. His chest pain recurred in
February of 1990 and he had another positive stress test ,
catheterization showed restenosis at the PTCA site and a second
PTCA was performed successfully. He has done well with negative
stress test , most recently in 6/7 .
Over the last several weeks to months , he has noted increasing
chest pain with less and less exertion and now presents with on and
off chest pain over the last 18 hours prior to admission. He was
treated in the Canter Memorial Hospital emergency room with beta
blockers and IV TNG which was limited by low blood pressure and
bradycardia. Because of ongoing chest pain with EKG changes , the
patient was taken directly to the cath lab and found to have a 70 %
left main , 80 % proximal LAD , 60 % OMB 2 , and minor irregularities
at the right coronary artery PTCA site.
Because of his continuing chest pain in the cath lab , an
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and the patient was
transferred to the CCU. His past medical history is significant
for coronary artery disease , hypertension , depression. He has no
past surgical history.
MEDICATIONS: His medications on admission include Diltiazem ,
Naprosyn , aspirin , Prozac.
ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is a white gentleman in moderate
distress. His heart rate is 54 , blood
pressure of 100/60 , jugular venous distention to 8 cm. with no
carotid bruits. Chest is clear to auscultation. The heart rate is
regular with a regular rhythm and no murmur. The abdomen is
benign. Neurologically , is grossly intact. His EKG on admission
shows sinus bradycardia with lateral ST and T wave abnormalities.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital and
underwent emergent catheterization as above
requiring an intra-aortic balloon pump and was then taken for
urgent surgery. On 7/28/95 , he was taken to the operating room
where he underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 utilizing
the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
coronary artery , and saphenous vein grafts to the obtuse marginal ,
ramus , under general endotracheal anesthesia and cardiopulmonary
bypass. This was performed by Dr. Gondek and there were no
complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well. He was
taken to the post surgical intensive care unit in stable condition.
He remained hemodynamically stable over the first postoperative
night and was extubated without any problem. His intra-aortic
balloon pump was weaned down as tolerated and removed at the bed
side. He was started on Lopressor and aspirin and continued on
Ancef perioperatively. He was given Lasix for diuresis and
responded well. He progressed well and had his chest tubes removed
and was ambulating and tolerating a regular diet well. By
postoperative day five , a moderate amount of tan drainage was
noticed at the lower portion of his sternal wound. The sternum was
only slightly unstable and the wires all appeared intact on chest
x-ray. He was started no Vancomycin. By postoperative day seven ,
he continued to be afebrile and hemodynamically stable , saturating
at 95 % on room air. His sternal wound remained clean and he was
discharged home to be followed up by VNA with dressing changes and
monitored closely.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Include enteric coated aspirin once a
day , Prozac twice a day , Lopressor 25 mg.
bid , Tylox one to two capsules q three to four hours prn pain ,
Cipro 500 mg. bid for five days.
He will follow up with Dr. Lemieux and with his local physician.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 60 year old , black male
who initially presented for an injured
knee , which occurred three days ago at work. He was noted in
triage to have a blood pressure of 210/130 and was triaged to
urgent. The patient has had a long-standing history of
hypertension and he stopped his medications actually about two
months ago when he ran out of prescriptions. Following this the
patient began to note some difficulty with dyspnea on exertion and
has also noted some altered sensations in his chest during the week
prior to admission , which lasted approximately one to two seconds
and occurred primarily at rest. These occurred across his chest
but did not radiate. The patient stated his shortness of breath
has become progressively worse. He has had no orthopnea.
Basically , over the past three weeks the patient has noted ( 1 ) his
irregular heart beat , as if he is missing beats , although he does
not note any tachycardia , ( 2 ) dyspnea on exertion , including
orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and ( 3 ) intermittent
substernal chest pain which occurs only at rest and not with
exertion. He described this as an ache and stated it did not
radiate. The episodes lasted , at the most , four to five minutes ,
and resolved on their own without any other symptoms. He denies
any syncope or presyncope. Four years ago , as mentioned , he
slipped at work , bending his right leg , and has subsequently had
increased swelling of his right knee , foot and calf , also with some
calf pain. Today was a holiday and he had off from work , so he
came to the Emergency Ward , primarily for evaluation of his knee
and his dyspnea. At that time they found that he was in atrial
flutter.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history includes
hypertension , LVH , asthma , increased
cholesterol , borderline diabetes mellitus , obesity , gastritis ,
allergic rhinitis , depression , osteoarthritis , chronic right knee
effusion , and impotence , status post penile implant.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: His medications include Procardia XL
60 mg q day , Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q
day , Mevacor 40 mg q day , Ventolin and Beconase inhalers , Seldane
p.r.n. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. , Elavil 25 mg h.s. , and Paxil 20 mg q
day. He has not taken these in the past two months.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and lives with his wife. He is a
bulldozer operator. He does not smoke , drink or
use any drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is negative for coronary artery
disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His physical examination showed a black
male in no acute distress. His pressure at
the time of admission examination was 170/100. His heart rate was
in the 50 to 80 range. Respirations were 16. Temperature was
98.7. He was satting 98 percent on room air. Heent was benign.
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy. The lungs had some
bibasilar crackles and slight wheezes on the left. The heart was
irregularly irregular with an S1 , S2 and S4. There were no
murmurs. The abdomen had normal bowel sounds and was soft , mildly
obese and non-tender. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal was
heme negative per Emergency Ward. Extremities showed 1+ right
edema and some trace , left sided , lower extremity edema. Right
knee was very swollen and he had right calf tenderness but no cord.
On neurological examination he was alert and oriented times three.
Examination was non-focal.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs showed a sodium of 142 , potassium 4.4 ,
chloride of 102 , bicarbonate of 26 , BUN 14 ,
creatinine 1.1 , and blood glucose was 122. Magnesium was 1.6. CK
was 385 and MB was 2.9. White cell count was 7.8 , hematocrit 43.7 ,
and platelets were 234 , 000. His PT was 12.7 , PTT 24.4. Chest
x-ray showed increased cardiac silhouette , PVR , and there were no
infiltrates. The knee film showed a large effusion , which was
present in the past , and some osteoarthritis but no sign of
fracture. The patient had lower extremity non invasives which were
negative and a VQ scan which was read as between low and
intermediate probability.
ASSESSMENT: This is a 60 year old man with long-standing
hypertension , now off medications for two months. He
presented with new atrial fibrillation , mild congestive heart
failure and intermittent atypical chest pain. Given symptoms were
predated by a leg injury , his lower extremity non invasives were
negative and VQ scan was low to intermediate probability , the
possibility of pulmonary embolism was not further pursued. Likely
mechanism is poorly controlled hypertension and conduction system
disease causing atrial flutter and congestive heart failure. His
low rate is worrisome for intrinsic conduction disease and it was
considered that there was no need for anticoagulation for atrial
flutter.
HOSPITAL COURSE: As noted , the patient had lower extremity non
invasives and VQ scans which were essentially
negative and he was not treated for pulmonary embolism , as it was
considered to be ruled out. He had an echocardiogram during his
admission which showed 50 percent ejection fraction with inferior
hypokinesis and left atrial size of 4 cm. The patient remained in
atrial flutter during his admission and was coumadinized for the
concern he may be slipping from atrial flutter to atrial
fibrillation occasionally. He was also started on Digoxin. The
patient remained stable and did well. He ruled out for myocardial
infarction. He was then discharged for follow up with Dr.
Gulbraa for his general medical concerns and will have an
appointment with Dr. Linegar for cardioversion and an exercise
tolerance test. The patient's Dig levels and PT will be checked as
an outpatient by the VNA services and these will also be called to
Dr. Beckler . The patient's admission was without complication.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: The patient's discharge medications
and dosing were Ventolin two puffs
q.i.d. p.r.n. shortness of breath , Ecasa 325 mg p.o. q day , Digoxin
0.25 mg p.o. q day , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q day , Lisinopril 30 mg p.o.

b.i.d. , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Serevent two puffs inhaler b.i.d. ,
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient's condition on
discharge was stable. Disposition was to home with
services. DISABILITY: Estimated disability was mild.

Denies alcohol use. Quit smoking 20 years ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In the emergency room the patient was
afebrile with a heart rate of 105 , blood
pressure 123/72 , breathing at a rate of 20 , satting 88% on room
air , increased to 95% on 2 L nasal cannula. The patient jugular
venous pressure to her ear. LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds
one-third of the way up bilaterally with scattered crackles.
HEART: Irregularly irregular without murmurs reported. The
patient has a 2/6 diamond shaped early peaking systolic ejection
murmur at the right upper sternal border consistent with her
diagnosis of aortic stenosis/sclerosis. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender.

pulmonary edema. ECG compared with April 2001 showed no
ischemic changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient was given
increasing doses of Lopressor for rate control of
her atrial fibrillation up to 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. On 2/6/02 the
patient was found with a heart rate in the 30s. It was then
decreased to the 20s and the patient was presyncopal. A code blue
was called. The patient was treated with atropine and
transthoracic pacing and Dopamine for hypotension. The patient was
intubated for airway protection. She weaned slowly off the vent in
the cardiac care unit , was extubated on 9/14/02 and transferred to
the floor on 3/20/02 . On the floor the patient was convalescing ,
diuresing with Lasix 40 mg IV p.r.n. for a goal of 500-1 , 000 cc
negative each day. This IV dose was changed to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
The patient's Captopril was titrated up as her blood pressure
tolerated and this was changed to zestril 40 mg before discharge.
The patient continued on amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.day , which was
changed to 300 mg p.o. q.day on discharge. The patient remained in
sinus rhythm with a heart rate ranging from 48 to the high 60s.
The patient was not symptomatic with this relative bradycardia but
it was noted that in the future if this persists , a pacemaker
should be considered.
PULMONARY: The patient had fever and hypoxia in the cardiac care
unit. Sputum was cultured and grew pansensitive pneumococcus. The
patient was started on ampicillin which was changed to amoxicillin
on day seven of antibiotics. The patient was also placed
temporarily on albuterol and Atrovent nebs which were discontinued
on 11/28/02 .
FEN/GI: The patient had a mild hypernatremia up to 152 and
contraction on glyc improved with regard to correcting her
intravascular volume status. She was maintained on low salt diet
and lytes were repleted p.r.n. The patient was kept on regular NPH
doses with CZI sliding scale p.r.n. Although morning sugars ranged
in the 60-70s , afternoon glucoses were often in the mid 200s. Mrs.
Acevedo primary care physician may want to consider adding a
midday dose of regular insulin.
DERMATOLOGY: The patient had palmar and plantar lesions diagnosed
by dermatology as palmoplantar keratoderma that was treated with
miconazole.
Physical therapy was consulted and gave recommendations about
oxygen use at home as well as use of a walker and home safety.

*****
IMPRESSION: Ms. Denna is a 58F with a h/o diabetes , CAD s/p stent to
LAD in 2004 , permanent pacemaker for ?afib/SSS , who was admitted with
chest pain that she described as exactly like her MI w/ ckmb elevated.
However she also stated that her chest pain had never really resolved
after her cath in 2004. Complicating factors include multiple admissions
for chest pain , chronic pain syndrome , and narcotic dependence.
**CV: i: Initially there was concern b/c her CKMB fraction was
elevated , and there were T wave inversions in V3-V6 that seemed new in a
non-paced EKG that was captured. She received one dose of therapeutic
lovenox , which was discontinued when she ruled out. She continued to
complain of chest pain throughout her admission , which typically would be
relieved by morphine. Suspicion for cardiac chest pain is low , but a
MIBI was obtained to determine her baseline. The MIBI
revealed normal perfusion and normal EF. There was abnormal uptake in the
left axilla , and obtaining a mammogram was recommended.
**NEURO: High pain med requirements secondary to chronic pain , and
surgical interventions. She was maintained on regimen as outlined in
last d/c summary , including MS Contin 30mg BID and oxycodone 30mg po q4h
prn pain. Pain service was called but did not see her in house and
recommended outpatient follow up with either rheumatology or psychiatry
re her chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia. Bladder training can be
considered given her urinary incontinence.
**ORTHO: recent procedure ( 10/24 L3-L5 laminectomy for cauda equina ,
I&D for seroma 7/8 .  Orthopedics followed while she was in house. She
was noted to have a small protrusion likely muscle herniation in the site
of the recent procedure. Dr. Loendorf ID saw the patient and will see
her in follow up. She is to continue the vancomycin through 6/25/07 , and
then the vancomycin and the PICC should be discontinued. She will follow up
with Dr. Dininger on July .

Discharge Date: 4/5/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CARDIOMYOPATHY.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. Coronary artery disease. 2.
Hyperlipidemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 50 year old gentleman
with a history of CAD dating back to
1991 when the cath showed one vessel disease. He was not
angioplastied. The patient had an MI at that time which was
medically managed. The patient did well until July of 1995 when
the patient had another anterior MI , massive , treated with
thrombolytics. Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed a 99%
proximal RCA and serial 70% LAD lesions. The patient also was
noted to have a severe LV dysfunction with an ejection fraction of
28% and his MI was complicated by a complete heart block and a dual
chamber pacemaker was placed. At that time the patient was
considered to be a surgical candidate secondary to high risk. In
August of 1995 the patient was admitted for non Q wave MI with a
peak CK of 798 , positive MB fraction , and was again treated with
thrombolysis with TPA. The patient did well with no anginal
symptoms but has had primarily symptoms of CHF with dyspnea upon
exertion , progressive shortness of breath , and limited exercise
tolerance since that time. In July of 1996 the patient had an
exercise tolerance test with oxygen consumption measured at 11.8
ml/kg. The patient exercised for 6 minutes and reached a maximal
heart rate of 114 and stopped secondary to dyspnea. Given the
patient's poor functional status he presented for cardiac
catheterization and complete workup for cardiac transplant. The
patient admits no shortness of breath at rest but with 1-2 flights
of steps. He also becomes short of breath with ten minutes of
light labor. The patient also has daily angina with neck pain
radiating to his head which is relieved with rest.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. CAD , as above status post MI times three
in 1991 and 1995 twice. 2. CHF , ischemic
cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 28% since July of 1995.
3. Hyperlipidemia with a cholesterol in the 300s.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for coronary artery disease paternal
uncle , died at that age of 39 of an MI. Sister
died at the age of 66 of an MI. Brother had an MI at the age of
55. Positive for diabetes mellitus in a paternal uncle. Positive
for hypertension in his mother. Father died of emphysema.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Positive for tobacco , four packs per day times 20
years , quit in 1991. Ethanol , one glass of wine
per day , quit in 1995. Married times 27 years , three children ages
21 to 25. Retired merchandise wholesaler , currently on disability.

Guaiac negative. Prostate no nodules.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium of 145 , potassium 4.9 , chloride
102 , bicarb 28 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.5 ,
glucose of 90. Calcium of 9.9 , phosphorus 3.4 , cholesterol 178 ,

count of 188 , 000. PT 1.3 , PTT of 30.5. LFTs: AST 54 , ALT 39.
EKG showed a left bundle branch block with Q waves in V1 and V3 ,
biatrial enlargement , inverted T waves in II , III , and AVF. Chest
x-ray revealed cardiomegaly , DDD pacer wires in position , lungs
clear.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted originally for a workup
for cardiac transplant. The patient had a
cardiac transplant labs drawn , had a PPD placed , which was negative
with positive controls. The patient had a psychiatry consult.
Hepatitis serology for hepatitis B and C were negative. The
patient was kept on heparin at therapeutic levels and was diuresed
with Lasix. His Captopril was also increased. The patient was
also treated with Isordil. At this point the patient was
reassessed and it was thought that he might be a candidate for a
revascularization. With this in mind , the patient was scheduled
for a ETT Thallium which if positive for ischemia he would go for a
cardiac catheterization. In the meantime the patient was medically
managed , diuresed of three to four liters over the several days of
admission. His Isordil was increased and he was continued on aspirin and
digoxin , on Mevacor. Further transplant labs revealed a TSH of
2.8 , T3 of 159 , T4 of 7.8. Urine 24 hour collection total volume
was 4200 cc , creatinine of 29 , urine protein less than assay. The
patient had his ETT Thallium which showed a question of septal
ischemia with a fixed apical defect. The patient went 6 minutes on
a standard Bruce protocol with a maximum heart rate of 156 , stopped
secondary to chest pain and 1 mm ST segment depressions. The
patient went to cardiac catheterization the following day. The
patient's cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel disease
with a 100% LAD. His catheterization film was evaluated by cardiac
surgery , Dr. Wolinski who believed that the patient would not benefit
from a CABG. Given this , the patient received a continued
transplant workup of a CT of the abdomen , as well as a dental
consult , with a planned tooth extraction , with appropriate
premedication with amoxicillin , and holding of his heparin. The
patient tolerated this well. Preliminary report on the CT of the
abdomen showed a small single less than 1 cm hepatic lesion. The
patient was medically stable on discharge.
The patient was found to have increasing LFT's upon discharge. Subsequently ,
his mevacor was dicontinued and LFT's returned to norma. DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS: Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.day , Lasix
80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q.day
( Discontinued immediately after discharge ) , Coumadin to be taken for 5 mg
q.h.s. for four days and then to resume the 2.5 mg
with 5 mg q.o.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with the Cardiomyopathy
Service. The patient will be followed up to see how he
is tolerating his new medical regimen and be further evaluated for
cardiac transplant.

Discharge Date: 6/22/1994
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE: 1. ASTHMA.
2. MORBID OBESITY.
3. ALCOHOL ABUSE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Zukowsky is a 50 year old woman with a
long history of asthma who presented
with shortness of breath and palpitations. Her asthma is
characterized by multiple short admissions for flares , last in
October 1993 , and multiple courses of steroid tapers. At home , she
uses Ventolin and Theophylline. Her other medical problems include
morbid obesity and a history of alcohol abuse. She has had
palpitations in the past and a Holter in 4/19 showed only three
episodes of supraventricular tachycardia. She has also had a
stress test in February 1992 which was a nine minute arm cycle
stress test with maximal heart rate of 128 and systolic blood
pressure of 120. The test was negative for ischemic changes. She
has never had an EKG showing atrial fibrillation. She came into
the Emergency Ward on 8/22/94 complaining of two weeks of
intermittent palpitations as well as shortness of breath. She used
increased doses of her Ventolin inhaler for this and continued on
her Theophylline. She felt her heart fluttering quite a bit and
intermittently , these palpitations would go away. She never took
her heart rate during these episodes nor could she characterize her
heart as being irregular. Prior to the palpitations beginning , she
had gone on a drinking binge and had drank a half a pint of brandy.
She has had a cough productive of whitish sputum but no change in
the sputum character chronically. Her asthma has been slightly
increasing with increased wheezing and she has been using her
inhaler more. In the Emergency Ward , her EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with a heart rate in the 130 range. She was
controlled with intravenous Diltiazem and admitted for new onset
atrial fibrillation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above and also
including degenerative joint disease of the knees and ankles.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Slo-phyllin and Ventolin Inhaler. ALLERGIES:
She had no known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with
her two children , has used alcohol in binges , and does not smoke.
FAMILY HISTORY: She has a family history of coronary artery
disease with a mother who died of a myocardial infarction in her
fifties.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a morbidly obese black female in no
acute distress. Her temperature was 98.2 ,
heart rate 108 , blood pressure 110/68 , and O2 saturations 96% on
two liters. HEAD/NECK: Examinations were negative , her jugular
venous pressure was not visible secondary to obesity , and her
carotids were 1+ bilaterally. LUNGS: Showed scant wheezing at the
left base otherwise were clear. CARDIAC: Examination was
irregularly irregular , she had distant S1 and S2 , and no murmurs.
ABDOMEN: Obese , soft , non-tender , and no organomegaly.
EXTREMITIES: Without definite edema. RECTAL: Examination was OB
negative with decreased tone. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was
essentially non-focal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Notable on admission were a theophylline
level of 23.6 which was elevated , an SMA 7
which was within normal limits with the exception of a potassium of
3.8 , BUN and creatinine of 5 and 0.9 , and CBC showed a white count
of 6.1 , hematocrit 40.8 , and platelets of 288. An EKG showed
atrial fibrillation at 136 with low voltage and poor R wave
progression. Chest X-Ray showed no infiltrates or effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Service.
Her rate was controlled with intravenous
Diltiazem drip which was changed over to 90 mg p.o. q.d. In
addition , she was started on Digoxin and her rate was controlled to

pressure 146/84 , O2 saturation 96% on room air. HEENT: PERRLA ,
dentition without evidence of infection , left and right carotid
bruits. Chest: Healed midline sternotomy. Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm , systolic murmur heard throughout
precordium. Respiratory: Rales present bilaterally. Abdomen:
Soft , no masses , scars noted from prior appendectomy and
cholecystectomy. Extremities: Multiple small abrasions and
bruises over both legs. Neurologic: Alert and oriented.
Cranial nerves grossly intact except for tongue , which deviates
to the left. Strength 5/5 in the upper and lower extremities.
Sensation and reflexes symmetric and equal. Pulses 2+
bilaterally at carotids , radials , femorals and PTs , present by
Doppler at DPs bilaterally. Allen's test of the left and right
upper extremities both normal.
PREOPERATIVE LABS: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 101 ,
bicarb 29 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 298. White blood cell
count 6.0 , hematocrit 42.9 , hemoglobin 13.8 , platelets 237 , 000 ,
PT 15.9 , INR 1.3 , PTT 29.6. Urinalysis was normal.
CAROTID IMAGING: The patient had less than 25% stenosis of the
right internal and left internal carotid arteries. MR angiogram
of the left internal carotid artery showed 60% occlusion and 50%
occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac
catheterization performed on 4/7/06 at Kan Hospital revealed 100% ostial LAD stenosis , 100% proximal
circumflex stenosis , 70% ostial left main stenosis , 75% mid RCA
stenosis , 50% proximal RT LV-BR stenosis , and proximal stenosis of the
right PDA. CABG grafts from prior bypass surgery were all
patent.
Echocardiogram on 6/5/06 showed an ejection fraction of 60% ,
aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 38 mmHg and peak gradient
of 67 mmHg , calculated valve area was estimated at 0.7 sq cm.
There was mild mitral valve insufficiency. An EKG on 5/27/06
showed first-degree AV block with a heart rate of 62 and inverted
T waves in leads I , aVL and V4 through V6.
Chest x-ray on 7/6/06 was consistent with congestive heart
failure and revealed aortic calcifications and left lower lobe
atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 7/6/06 for
completion of his preoperative workup. He was brought to the
operating room on 10/22/06 where Dr. Luangrath performed a reoperative
sternotomy and a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement
using a 23-mm Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve. The
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 186 minutes and the aortic
cross-clamp time was 77 minutes. The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery
Intensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. Over
the next few days , the patient was extubated. He had episodes of
uncontrolled hypertension and was placed on a nitroglycerin drip.
By postoperative day #4 , the patient had been weaned off his
drips and his blood pressure was well controlled. He had been
hemodynamically stable and afebrile in the Intensive Care Unit.
He was ready for transfer to the regular hospital floor for the
remainder of his recovery. At that point , the patient demonstrated
postoperative confusion , particularly at night. The
patient's neurological exam was otherwise normal. The patient
was started on cardiac medications including captopril , Lopressor
and aspirin. He had been extubated without complication and was
oxygenating well with the support of 1 liter of oxygen via nasal
cannula. He had no respiratory issues. The patient was seen by
the Speech and Swallow Service for his history of dysphagia and
was cleared for mechanical soft diet with nectar-thick liquids
and crushed pills. The patient's diet was advanced as tolerated.
He exhibited adequate urine output with diuretics
postoperatively for fluid retention. The patient was followed by
the Diabetes Management Service in the postoperative period for
his history of diabetes. He was initially on an insulin drip and
then weaned to a NovoLog sliding scale with supplemental Lantus
insulin in the evenings. The patient's hematocrit had dropped to
22 on postoperative operative day #3 and he was transfused one
unit of packed red blood cells with an appropriate hematocrit
bumped to 26. On postoperative days #4 through #6 , the patient
continued his slow steady progress. The neurology team who had
visited him after surgery after his mental status changes
recommended holding his Sinemet and only to restart if his
Parkinson symptoms reoccur. Otherwise , the patient
experienced some hypertension and his blood pressure medications
were titrated accordingly. The patient remained in a sinus
rhythm. By postoperative day #6 , his blood pressure was stable.
He was oxygenating well on room air and was ambulating
comfortably in the halls. He had a sitter accompany him in his
room for impulsivity , however , this became unnecessary after
postoperative day #6. A PA and lateral chest x-ray looked clear
with no infiltrates and no pneumothorax. He had returned to his
baseline mental status and he was deemed ready for discharge to
the rehabilitation facility , which is owned by his daughter.
On the day of discharge , the patient's vital signs were
temperature 97.7 degrees , heart rate 65 in sinus rhythm , blood
pressure 104/60 , O2 saturation 97% on room air. Respiratory rate
20. The patient was still several kilograms above his
preoperative weight. A urinalysis had suggested a low-level
infection and his urine culture was growing proteus 5000 CFUs and
he was started on a seven day course of ciprofloxacin.
LABORATORY DATA: On the day of discharge , sodium 143 , potassium
4.2 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 34 , BUN 33 , creatinine 1.2 ,
glucose 102 , magnesium 2.4 , white blood cell count 11.6 ,

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 56-year-old smoker status post renal transplant in January
of this year complicated by delayed graft function and sepsis who
presented two days prior to admission with shortness of breath
and chest pain. The patient was found to have critical aortic
stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 cm2 an EF of 60%. The patient
does have a history of positive stress test for which a cardiac
catheterization was performed in 6/29 .  At that time , he was
found to have 40% lesion of the LAD. On admission to the
Nides Medical Center , on 10/12/05 , cardiac enzymes were drawn and this showed
a troponin level of 0.21. EKG showed no acute changes. The
patient was placed ACS protocol and initially admitted to the
Cardiology Service. The Cardiac Surgery Service was consulted
for emergent aortic valve repair and potential coronary artery
bypass grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. End-stage renal disease secondary to hypertension , status
post cadaveric renal transplant in 5/13 complicated by delayed
graft function and sepsis , baseline creatinine 2.2-2.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
On 10/17/05 , the patient was brought to the operating room for
critical aortic stenosis , acute coronary syndrome and acute
pulmonary edema. He underwent an aortic valve replacement with a
#21 Carpentier-Edwards magna valve , as well as a coronary artery
bypass graft x1 with LIMA to LAD. Bypass time was 120 minutes
and crossclamp time 90 minutes. Two atrial wires and one
ventricular wire was placed. Please see the operative note for
further details. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He
was extubated with without incident on postoperative day #1. His
neurologic status was in time and he did not suffer any delirium
as witnessed after his initial emergence from anesthesia during
the renal transplantation. He was noted to have significant oral
secretions , but these were clear and thin. On postoperative day
#1 , his femoral arterial line was removed and his renal
transplantation medications restarted. His CK-MB peaked at 46
and did trend down thereafter. On postoperative day #2 , he had
begun to be diuresed in light persistent pulmonary edema and seen
by chest x-ray. His chest tubes were removed without incident.
On postoperative day #3 , he was hemodynamically stable. His FK
levels were noted to be low , as is historically the case with
him. Renal Transplant Medicine was following and did titrated
his medications as necessary. On postoperative day #4 , his final
left chest tube was removed. Post-pull chest x-ray showed the
lung to be well expanded. He was found to be hyponatremic with a
sodium of approximately 130. He was begun on fluid restriction
of 1.5 liters for hematocrit of 21. A 1 unit of packed red blood
cells was also given at this time and he was continued on
diuresis. On postoperative day #5 , as his preoperatively weight
had been reached , he was taken off of diuresis. His renal
transplantation medications discontinue. The patient was up out
of bed and ambulating well. The patient was also noted to have a
large sacral decubitus ulcer , without exposure of bone. This
ulcer was the result of the previous admission in January after
renal transplantation. The Plastic Surgery Service was consulted
and their recommendations included appropriate therapeutic
support surface , frequent turning with minimization of being in
the seated position , optimization of nutrition , and wet-to-dry
dressings to the wound. The service is still following the
patient and will consider VAC dressing and the later time.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Urosepsis.
LIST OF PROBLEMS:
1. Urosepsis.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure.
3. Pneumonia.
4. Aspiration.
5. Pulmonary embolism.
6. Diabetes.
7. Obstructive sleep apnea.
8. Spinal sarcoidosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of spinal
sarcoidosis with secondary paraplegia who presented with altered
mental status , hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. He
was doing well until the morning of 4/29/2006 when he complained
of difficulty breathing and his wife placed him on home CPAP
machine that he usually uses at night. Despite being placed on
the machine , he was still having air hunger and complaining of
feeling unwell. His wife also noted him to have increasing
lethargy and decreased responsiveness and called EMS to have him
brought to the emergency room. He also was noted to have a
decreased urine output from his chronic suprapubic catheter x2
days. In the emergency room , he was found to be unresponsive ,
grunting , and in respiratory distress. His initial room air
saturation was in the high 60's to low 70's. He was placed on
100% nonrebreather with some improvement of his saturations in
the low 90's and an ABG of 7.37/43/77 on 100% nonrebreather. He
was therefore intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. He
became hypotensive with intubation despite using etomidate with
blood pressures in the 60's/40's , and an initial CVP of 16 , so he
was started on Levophed with a systolic blood pressure in the
130's on 7 to 10 of Levophed. He received 1 liter of IV fluid.
He received a head CT without contrast that showed no acute
bleeding or acute infarction. He had a chest x-ray that showed
no obvious infiltrate. His INR was found to be elevated. Given
the CT of his abdomen without contrast that showed a suprapubic
catheter obstruction with bilateral hydronephrosis and distended
bladder. His creatinine was 2.9 , elevated from his baseline of
0.9. Urology was consulted to change the suprapubic catheter
tube and pus was noted to be aspirated from the suprapubic
catheter. He was started on vancomycin , gentamicin , Flagyl , and
stress dose steroids , and blood and urine cultures were sent in
the emergency and he was transferred to the MICU.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Sarcoid disease 20 years ago , paraplegia x18 years , chronic
suprapubic catheter/ostomy for 12 years , diabetes type II , right
DVT , on Coumadin , status post chronic UTI , and CPAP at night for
obstructive sleep apnea.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
Include Regular Insulin sliding scale a.c. and at bedtime , NPH 54
units in the morning and 68 units in the night , baclofen 10 mg
t.i.d. , amitriptyline 25 mg at bedtime , oxybutynin 5 mg t.i.d. ,
gabapentin 300 mg t.i.d. , iron sulfate 325 mg t.i.d. , vitamin C
500 mg daily , magnesium 420 mg t.i.d. , Coumadin 5 mg daily ,
ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. , and calcium 950 mg daily.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
His temperature was 97.4 , heart rate 105 , blood pressure 136/67 ,
his O2 saturation was 100% on AC 700 with PEEP of 5. In general ,
he was intubated and responsive to simple commands. HEENT:
Sluggish pupils. His lungs were clear anteriorly. His heart was
in regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. His
abdomen was obese , large , soft , nondistended and nontender , with
positive bowel sounds. His extremities had chronic venous stasis
changes of right and lower extremities with areas of no skin
breakdown. He had a large sacral decubitus ulcer with bone
exposed that was foul smelling on his sacrum. He was
neurologically moving all four extremities and following
commands. He had an ostomy and suprapubic catheter in place.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
Notable for an elevated creatinine of 2.9 , otherwise , his Chem-7
was within normal limits. His LFTs were within normal limits.
His hematocrit was 34.6 , his white count was 9.4 , and his
platelets were 343 , 000. He had negative cardiac enzymes. His
urine and blood tox screens were negative. His UA was
significant for 3+ protein , trace glucose , negative ketones , 3+
leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 4-10 red blood cells , 4+
bacteria , and 3+ triple phosphate crystals. His EKG was in
normal sinus rhythm with an old right bundle-branch block and
left axis deviation , first-degree AV block. His chest x-ray
showed retrocardiac opacity that was thought to be aspiration
versus pneumonia. Abdominal and chest CT showed bibasilar
airspace opacities , left greater than right , with aspiration
versus pneumonia , bilateral hydronephrosis , severe decubitus
ulcers , and large gastrohepatic lymph nodes slightly enlarged and
calcified.
ASSESSMENT:
This is a 66-year-old man with spinal sarcoidosis and secondary
paraplegia , who presented with altered mental status , hypoxemic
respiratory failure , and hypotension , who had urosepsis and
pneumonia and found later on admission to have pulmonary
embolism.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Hypoxemia: He was intubated at the time of admission and
extubated a day later on 5/7/2006. BiPAP was used at night as
he had used at home for a sleep apnea with O2 saturations in the
high 90's on room air during the day. He was initially treated
for pneumonia with ceftazidime , levofloxacin , and vancomycin.
The vancomycin was discontinued on 3/18/2006 , and the
ceftazidime was discontinued on 10/8/206. His levofloxacin was
continued at 500 mg per day for a total 10-day course on
5/3/2006. This is to be used for a UTI and pneumonia. On
11/8/2006 , the patient was supposed to go home and found to have
a desaturation to high 80's on room air. He was found to have a
chest x-ray within normal limits. A pulmonary embolism CT was
done that demonstrated a small nonocclusive pulmonary embolism in
the posterobasilar segment of the right lower lobe with involving
right lower lobe infarct suggestive that he had had a PE that was
resolving. At this time , his INR had been subtherapeutic for
three days at 1.7 to 1.9 and he was continued on his Coumadin.
The following day , his INR was therapeutic at 2 , and on the day
of discharge , it was 2.2. It was thought that the PE was in the
setting of a subtherapeutic INR. His oxygen requirement was back
to baseline at the time of discharge , and his goal INR was to be
on the higher end of the 2 to 3 range , which was goal previously.
He was also given nebulizer treatments throughout his
hospitalization.
2. ID: His urine was found to have Proteus , resistant to
Macrobid , and Klebsiella , resistant to ampicillin. Levofloxacin
was started for this and for the presumed pneumonia seen on chest
x-ray for a total of a 10-day course. Sputum and blood cultures
have been no growth to date. He had no fevers and no elevated
white counts.
3. Cardiac: He was thought to have an element of autonomic
insufficiency secondary to sarcoid with episodes of hypo and
hypertension in the MICU. His cortisol stim test was within
normal limits , it was 14.5 before stim and 23.6 after stim , so he
was not treated with steroids. His blood pressure was in the
30's to 160's with pauses in the 100's on the floor with frequent
bigeminy and trigeminy and many PVCs , so he was started on 12.5
b.i.d. metoprolol on 7/6/2006 with good results. He continued
to have ectopy and continued to be hypertensive , and given his
diabetes , he was started on a low dose of captopril on 6/20/2006
with no complications and was able to maintain blood pressures in
ideal ranges.
4. GU: Urology replaces suprapubic catheter early on admission.
He was continued to have bladder irrigation with good effect ,
and Urology signed off on 7/13/2007.
5. Endocrine: The patient was given NPH 20 b.i.d. through his
hospitalization and Regular Insulin sliding scale. His sugars
were high on this reduced regimen and so he was placed on his
home NPH doses for discharge.
6. Decubitus ulcer: Plastic Surgery was consulted on 4/29/2006
and the wound did not look infected. It was debrided and
wet-to-dry t.i.d. dressing changes were recommended as well as
Panafil t.i.d. dressing changes. He was prescribed Panafil to go
home on.
7. Renal: The creatinine was initially 2.7 , and after receiving
IV fluids , it came down to 1.2. He likely had acute renal
failure secondary to postrenal obstructive etiology. His
creatinine was stable at around 1 for the remainder of his
admission.
8. Heme: The patient has a history of DVT. Initially , his INR
was found to be therapeutic and he was placed on levofloxacin , so
the plan was that he should have half of his home Coumadin dose
while he was on levofloxacin , so he was given half of dose and
his INRs came down to a nadir of 1.7. His INR was subtherapeutic
for three days , and at that time , a PE was found , his INR was
1.8. The day after this , his INR was 2 and then came up to 2.2
on the day of discharge. He was discharged on Coumadin 5 mg ,
which is his home dose to follow up at his Coumadin Clinic.
9. FEN: He was placed on maintenance IV fluids until cleared to
eat by Speech and Swallow. Speech and Swallow estimates having
baseline aspiration risk and he was known to cough and aspirate
at home. He had been recently worked up at the A County Medical Center
on a recent admission for aspiration pneumonia. They recommended
thickened puree diets and felt that even this he was likely to
aspirate. The risks and benefits of eating were explained to his
wife and him and he decided to continue to eat as there was no
ideal option.
10. Pain: He continued gabapentin , oxybutynin , and
amitriptyline as at home.
11. Prophylaxis: He was given Nexium and Coumadin.
12. Code status: He was full code , which was discussed with his
wife.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
The current temperature was 98 , the heart rate was 91 to 114 ,
blood pressure 100-114/54-70 , respiratory rate of 20 , and
saturating 97-100% on 1-2 liters. In general , he was responsive ,
alert , and appropriate. His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally. His heart had normal S1 and S2 , soft systolic
ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border. His abdomen
had positive bowel sounds , distended , soft and nontender. He had
a suprapubic catheter as well as an ostomy that were clean , dry
and intact. Extremities , he had 2+ peripheral edema that was
stable with no skin breakdown.
LABORATORY VALUES:
His labs at the time of discharge were stable. His hematocrit
was 27.2 , down from 29 , which was closed to his baseline of 34.
His INR was 2.1 at the time discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Amitriptyline 25 mg p.o. at bedtime , vitamin C 500 mg p.o. daily ,
baclofen 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Caltrate 600 Plus D one tablet p.o.
b.i.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. , gabapentin 300 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , NPH human insulin 54 units in the morning , 68 units
in the evening , Regular Insulin sliding scale , levofloxacin 500
mg p.o. daily , to end on 11/23/2006 for a total course of 10
days , magnesium oxide 420 mg p.o. t.i.d. , metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Panafil ointment t.i.d. ,
ranitidine 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily.
FOLLOW UP:
The patient will follow up his PCP , Dr. Dunstan The appointment
with Dr. Carros will be within the next week , and the
appointment with the Coumadin Clinic will be tomorrow or the next
day.
ISSUES FOR FOLLOW UP:
Include following up on his aspiration risk and continuing to
discourage thin liquids as well as encourage him sitting upright
when eating and being observed and stopping when he coughs. He
will need continuous blood pressure and heart rate monitoring
given the new beta-blocker and the ACE inhibitor as well as
assessment of his frequent PVCs. We will continue to follow his
diabetes and continue to follow his INR with a goal being 2 to 3
with ideal goal on the higher end 8 range.

placed by IR 9/9 and removed 11/8 Fluid was sterile with no evidence of
infection. Drain was removed due to a concern for the risk of infection
of a sterile fluid collection , particularly given it's relative proximity
to a joint and the risks that could be associated with a joint infection
in this woman. As per IR's recommendations , we asked our colleagues in
orthopedics to participate in this patient's care. They had no
recommendations for the short term given that her fluid collection had
been drained and she was pain free. Recommended that she could follow up
with Dr. Gene Alban in Orthopedic Oncology if her pain/fluid collection
recurs.
2. Pain control: Patient's pain was well controlled by IV morphine ( 2mg
Q4-6 hrs ) after drain placement- only required one day of IV morphine.
Following drainage of the fluid collection she noted that she was much
more comfortable and was well controlled with ibuprofen and low dose MSIR
( minimal requirement ). Will be discharged with prescription for MSIR
should her pain recur.
3. Prophylaxis: Patient received one dose of therapeutically dosed
lovenox pending the read of the MRI - then switched to prophylactic dosed
lovenox.
Patient remained full code throughout this hospitalization
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you have worsening of your leg/groin pain , you should contact your
oncologist.
If you have fevers or chill , nausea/vomiting , or shortness of breath , you
should contct your physician
You were treated for a seroma/hematoma adjacent to your iliopsoas muscle.
There was no evidence of infection based on the fluid collected from this
drainage. If the pain you were having recurs , or your leg edema worsens ,
you should contact your primary oncologist to determine the future
treatment plan. You were seen by Orthopedic Surgery during this admission
- their recommendation was that nothing needed to be done acutely and that
you could follow up with Dr. Clifton Walkner for further evaluation if you
are interested.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
F/U with Kenton Babic - ortho onc if needed. F/u final results of
cytology/gram stain for drained fluid.

Discharge Date: 2/10/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 58 year old woman ,
status post CABG times three in 7/6 ,
status post inferior myocardial infarction in 2/10 with a peak CPK
of 714. She has a history of chest pain since the CABG. The CABG
consisted of a LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein grafts to the OMB-2
and RCA. In 9/16 , she had been cathed and a 70% RCA occlusion with
a question of thrombus was seen. A 90% OMB-2 was seen; a
circumflex of 60% was seen; an LAD of 70% was seen. An LV-gram
showed inferior akinesis and posterior hypokinesis with a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 78%. Post CABG at baseline , she
had substernal chest pain at rest with rare use of sublingual
nitroglycerin. She has a history of peptic ulcer disease which was
a duodenal ulcer with melena. She had an EGD in 5/20 which showed
mild antral gastritis without ulcers. She is status post
colonoscopy in 9/16 which showed diverticulitis. She has a history
of anemia with a hematocrit of 29 , MCV of 68. She was treated with
iron sulfate and H2 blockers. She noted a history in two months of
a 20 pound weight loss. One week prior to admission , she had
melena of loose stool. She felt light-headed. She had a cough and
nocturia. Three days prior to admission , she noted a stabbing
periodic epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting twice; no coffee
grounds or hematemesis. She had dysphagia for months to liquids
and solids with the sensation of aspiration on swallowing. She had
a sharp pain radiating to the left arm and shortness of breath.
The pain was similar to the inferior MI in 1988. On 2/4 , she came
to the emergency ward , where her blood pressure was found to be
110/68 lying and 90/palp sitting. O2 sat was 97% on room air. Her
JVP was 9 cm with crackles at the right base. She was given three
sublingual nitroglycerins and Maalox. Her hematocrit was 20.8.
She was given 10 mg of IV Lopressor from which she became
hypotensive , but this resolved. She was transfused three units of
packed red blood cells , given Lasix and IV H2 blockers. She went
to the unit and ruled out for an MI by EKG and enzymes. The A-set
revealed a CPK of 54; B-set was 48; C-set was 36. An ABG was 132 ,
99 , 7.43 , 33. Potassium was 4.2 , BUN 20 , creatinine 0.9.
ALLERGIES: None known.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: JVD was 9 cm on admission and decreased;
scar at the left base of the neck secondary
to a basal cell resection; II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
left sternal border without gallop. The lungs revealed crackles at
the right base one quarter. She had a kyphoscoliosis. The abdomen
was benign. The neuro exam was nonfocal , though she had some past
pointing secondary to poor eyesight.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 7/5 , she was transferred to the floor. She
complained of some left arm pain secondary to her
IV , but she had no EKG changes and this improved with hot
compresses. She was guaiac negative. On the evening of 4/21 , she
was noted to be trace guaiac positive in the stool. On 7/6 at 7:30
AM , she complained of substernal chest pain which radiated to both
upper extremities with tingling bilaterally. This did not resolve ,
even after giving Maalox , four sublinguals and 12 mg of morphine
and three inches of Nitropaste. Her blood pressure was stable at
130/80 , heart rate was 68 , and she was afebrile. Her substernal
chest pain ranged between 7-3 , and she was given 20 mEq of Kay
Ciel. Her potassium was 3.8 , hematocrit 32.8 and stable. She was
given two more units of packed red blood cells after having been
given two more units of packed red blood cells between 7/5 and 10/27
IV nitroglycerin 50 units was started after one hour and 15 minutes
of pain. This was increased to 100 units. EKG changes were noted
as a flattening in V4 through V6 with no ST depressions , and she
had a T wave down in V3 which was new since admission. On 7/6 , she
was transferred to the unit. Her CKs were negative; A-set was 27 ,
B-set was 29 , C-set was 57 and D-set was 65. A catheterization
showed right atrial pressures of 12 , PCWP of 16 , SVR 1 , 000 , PVR 76 ,
PA 34/14 , cardiac output 6.8. Grafts from the aorta to the OM ,
aorta to the RCA and LIMA to the LAD were all patent. LAD showed
100% proximal occlusion , LAD diagonal showed a 50% long proximal
and circumflex showed a 50% proximal , OM-2 showed a 70% occlusion
at the origin. There was a mild increase in right and left sided
pressures. She was readmitted to the floor and watched. Her
hematocrit remained stable. She had an endoscopy done on the
morning of 7/10 , and the impression was of a large hiatal hernia
with no evidence of GI bleeding at this time. It was recommended
that she had an upper GI and small bowel follow through or repeat
colonoscopy in the future as an outpatient. Her hematocrit
remained stable at approximately 33 for the past four days. The
sed rate was 25 , PT and PTT within normal limits , potassium 4.2 ,
iron 182 , TIBC 432 , vitamin B-12 371 , folate 3.9 , ferritin 16 ,

STATUS POST RIGHT HERNIA REPAIR.
KNOWN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
STATUS POST NON Q WAVE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
IN 1989.
STATUS POST LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING
PTCA IN 1989.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old white
male with known cardiac disease ,
status post non Q wave myocardial infarction in 1989 , status post
left anterior descending PTCA in 1989 , who was admitted following
an episode of post myocardial infarction chest pain from an outside
hospital. Cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , history of tobacco , history of
myocardial infarction. Cardiac history dates back to 3/21 when the
patient experienced substernal chest discomfort and ruled in for
non Q wave myocardial infarction. A cardiac catheterization showed
95% left anterior descending lesion , left circumflex 70% lesion and
diffuse right coronary artery disease. He had PTCA of the left
anterior descending lesion and did well for approximately two
months but was readmitted at that time in 6/11 with recurrent chest
discomfort. A cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 30%
left anterior descending lesion , 40% circumflex lesion and 80% OMB3
lesion and 50% mid and distal RCA stenoses. He had no angina until
approximately two days prior to admission when he presented to an
outside hospital with substernal chest discomfort. He rule in for
an inferior myocardial infarction with CK peaking at 2316. He was
treated with morphine , IV nitroglycerin , aspirin , heparin and IV
streptokinase. He had recurrent chest discomfort post myocardial
infarction and was transferred to Vu Pe Headcount Hospitals .
HOSPITAL COURSE: On admission , the patient's medications were
optimized to increase his beta blockade.
Eventually , the patient was weaned from IV nitroglycerin and IV
heparin to oral nitrates. The patient had no further chest
discomfort during the admission and had a predischarged modified
Bruce protocol exercise tolerance test. He did have some episodes
of shortness of breath secondary to congestive heart failure ,
however , this resolved with Lasix. EKG was consistent with
inferior myocardial infarction on transfer. On 6/9 , he had a
modified Bruce protocol stress test for which he went nine minutes
without chest discomfort or shortness of breath. This was read as
evidence of no ischemia. The patient was discharged home on
5/19/93.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition. MEDICATIONS: On discharge included
diltiazem , 120 mg po b.i.d.; metoprolol , 75 mg po b.i.d.; Isordil ,

Discharge Date: 6/10/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Jesus Wigham , whose past medical
history includes diabetes ,
hypertension , and multiple prior coronary interventions
( ballooned ) , presents in a stable state for elective coronary
artery bypass graft , after a cardiac catheterization showed two
vessel disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 23 of November the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting , left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to left coronary
artery and then to obtuse marginal. After surgery the patient
became hypotensive and ischemic. A new angiogram was performed
which showed three vessel coronary artery disease , an occluded
sequential venous graft to obtuse marginal and left coronary
artery , and a patent left internal mammary artery graft.
The patient was reoperated; a new coronary artery bypass graft was
performed on 23 of June , a new vein graft was placed to the right
posterior descending artery and another one to the obtuse marginal.
An intra-aortic balloon pump had been previously placed and was
removed three days later.
OTHER EVENTS DURING HOSPITAL STAY: 1. Volume over-load for
which the patient has still
some fluid retention and is still being on diuretics.
2. The patient underwent multiple interventions in her groins ,
mostly for placement of arterial lines and intra-aortic balloon
pump. Some hematoma developed but it never worsened. Vascular
Surgery was consulted but no further intervention was done.
3. A very dubious diagnosis of cellulitis was done just after her
surgery for a redness and swelling in her leg and feet. Infectious
Disease was consulted and they ruled out the idea of cellulitis as
the patient has lichen ruber planus and Infectious Disease said
that this was the reason for her redness. In the last two days of
her stay in our hospital , the redness became a little bit more
visible , and there was some question of increased white blood
cells , so it was decided to start her on Ancef and it should be
continued for about seven more days.
4. The patient is on three days of levofloxacen treatment for a
urinary tract infection.
5. When the diagnosis of cellulitis was hypothized the first time ,
a Doppler study of her lower extremity was done that showed no
obstruction to venous flow.
6. The patient also went for a period in atrial fibrillation and
was treated and converted to normal sinus rhythm with beta
blockers , namely Lopressor.
CURRENT CONDITION: At present the patient is in stable condition ,
afebrile , heart rate 81 in sinus , blood
pressure 120/60 , respiratory rate 20 , with a saturation of 96% in
room air. Her blood sugar is 189 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.8 , sodium
137 , potassium 4.5 , bicarbonate 151 , white blood cells 10.7 ,
hematocrit 28.4 , and INR 1.4.
The list of medications is included in the discharge summary.
Thank you for accepting this patient.

requiring chemotherapy and radiation therapy , as well as a
history of splenectomy , asthma , and history of tobacco use , who
presents to our service with symptoms of congestive heart failure
including dyspnea on exertion , lower extremity bilateral edema ,
and decrease exercise tolerance. On the day of admission ,
2/22/03 , she underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed
clean coronary arteries. On August , 2003 , she then
underwent an elective mitral valvuloplasty , 26 Carpentier-Edwards
pericardial , with size 26 Cosgrove-Edwards ring and vegectomy.
In the immediate postoperative period , she was transferred to the
Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit initially requiring 0.5 of
epinephrine to maintain proper pressure. Epinephrine was weaned
to off on postoperative day #1. She was extubated in the evening
of the day of surgery and epinephrine was subsequently weaned to
off. Gentle diuresis was begun on postoperative day #1 as well
as low dose beta blocker , which she tolerated well. She was
transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Step Down Unit on
postoperative day #1 , where diuresis was increased. Baby aspirin
was begun , and the patient continued to make excellent
cardiovascular progress. On February , 2003 , she began to
complain of some persistent numbness and tingling of the left
lower extremity , which she felt to be interrupting her attempts
to stand and maintain balance. For further treatment , a
Neurology consult was obtained. Per Neurology , she was found to
have no weakness at the left lower leg and foot , although when
pressure was exerted on the foot , she reported an uncomfortable
tingling throughout the leg. She reported no back pain and no
change in bowel or bladder control. Sensory examination was
found to be intact , however , soft touch and pin sensation tested
in the lateral leg below the knee caused a spreading tingling
sensation throughout the left lower extremity. Per Neurology
recommendations , Neurontin 300 mg q.d. was begun and it was
recommended that she follow up with the Department of Neurology
following discharge if the tingling sensation has not improved.
With aggressive diuresis , the patient was able to regain her
postoperative weight and by the day of discharge was 1.7
kilograms below her preoperative weight. She has made excellent
cardiovascular progress following this surgery and is anticipated
to continue her rehabilitation at home with VNA System.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese young woman alert
and oriented x 3. HEENT: No carotid bruits or JVD present.
Pulmonary: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Coronary: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 , S2. No murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops appreciated. Abdomen: Obese , nontender , and
nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. Extremities: 2+ pulses at
all extremities bilaterally. Trace edema at the bilateral lower
extremities to mid calf. Skin: Midline sternotomy incision well
approximated , healing well. No areas of erythema or drainage
noted.
LABORATORY DATA: On the day of discharge , sodium 141 , potassium
4.2 , BUN 17 , creatinine 1.0 , calcium 8.9 , magnesium 2.6 , white
blood cell count 11.3 , hematocrit 33.5 , platelets 361 , and INR
1.0.
PROCEDURES: On 6/2/2003 , elective mitral valvuloplasty , 26
Cosgrove-Edwards ring with vegectomy , small sterile vegetations
on A2 and P2 debrided , and found by lab testing to be sterile
vegetations. Cross clamp times were confirmed by Gram stain as
sterile and debrided intraoperatively. Please refer to operative
note for details.
CONSULT: Consulted Department of Neurology with followup
recommendations implemented during this patient's stay.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged today to her home
with VNA assistance.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. x 7 days , Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.d. ,
ibuprofen 800 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n. pain , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Atrovent nebulizer 0.5 mg
nebulized q.i.d. , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.d. , K-Dur 30 mEq p.o.
q.d. to be discontinued or decreased if Lasix dose is changed ,
and Flovent 44 mcg/inh b.i.d.
The patient has been instructed to call to schedule follow up
appointments with Cogang Medical Center Department of
Cardiac Surgery , Dr. Elbert Reitzes , within 6-8 weeks following
discharge as well as her primary care physician , Dr. Keith Lapusnak in approximately 1-2 weeks as well as with her
Cardiologist , Dr. Wilbur Nuzzo in 1-2 weeks. She will
call on recommendation from her primary care physician to
schedule follow up appointment with Tor's Community Hospital Medical Center
Department of Neurology should her left lower extremity tingling
not resolve. At that time , she would be advised to pursue EMG
testing for further workup of dysasthesia. The patient has made
excellent progress following her mitral valvuloplasty surgery and
is anticipated that she will return to her full preoperative
level of independent functioning with continued cardiovascular
rehabilitation and VNA assistance.
Please call if further questions or concerns.
Thank you for referring this patient to our service.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: DORIAN SPORN MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Congestive iheart failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Pending.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Bloating , abdominal distention.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56-year-old woman with a
history of an idiopathic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% who
presents with bloating , abdominal distention , and fatigue. The
patient's idiopathic cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 1990. The
patient had a Chronicle device to monitor filling pressures
placed in 2001 , which has been nonfunctional since 2004. The
patient had worsening symptoms in September 2004 , which led to an
admission for diuresis. She showed evidence of fluid overload on
admission of diuresis with IV Lasix and IV dobutamine. The
patient developed a Chronicle device lead thrombus and was
started on anticoagulation. The patient underwent a right heart
cath in September 2004 , which showed an artery pressure of 10 , wedge
pressure of 25 , SVR 2074 , PVR 326 , and CI of 1.5. Post-diuresis
after addition of hydralazine and Isordil , the patient's RA
pressures were RA=8 , pulmonary artery=50/24 , cardiac index of 2.4
with SVR of 1205. The patient's most recent admission was in
August 2004 with decompensated heart failure , during which time
she was diuresed with IV Lasix , metolazone , and dobutamine and
diuresed 11 liters. The patient also began workup for cardiac
transplant at that time. The patient on this admission describes
one week of abdominal distention , lower extremity edema , and
stable two-pillow orthopnea. The patient describes no PND ,
shortness of breath , or palpitations. She also denies dietary or
med noncompliance.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Glyburide 10 in the a.m. and 5 in the p.m.
2. Digoxin 0.125 q.d.
3. Probenecid 500 q.d.
4. Multivitamin one tab q.d.
5. KCL 20 mEq q.d.
6. Celexa 20 mg q.d.
7. Hydralazine 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8. Ativan 0.5 t.i.d.
9. Coumadin 5 q.p.m.
10. Isordil 40 t.i.d.
11. Torsemide 200 b.i.d.
12. Lisinopril 2.5 q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with three daughters. She is
an ex-custodian with past tobacco use but no ethanol use. The
patient's family has no history of cardiomyopathy.
SIGNIFICANT LABS ON ADMISSION: Normal renal function with a BNP
of 1018 and no evidence of bandemia. EKG on admission shows
sinus tachycardia at 105 with normal axis , widened QRS , normal
PR , and no evidence left atrial enlargement , and no change since
1/25 Left heart cath in 1990.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient has no known CAD. She had a troponin at
admission of 0.12 , which subsequently went down to 0.10 less than
assay. It is thought to be secondary to right ventricular strain
with volume overload. The patient was initially started on
aspirin and a statin; however , given her no evidence of CAD and a
normal cholesterol panel , both aspirin and statin were
discontinued.
Pump: The patient presented as ""cold and wet"" with poor forward
flows secondary to systolic dysfunction and likely increased SVR.
The patient was started on dobutamine for improved inotrope.
The patient was also put on a Lasix strip for diuresis after a
loading dose. The patient was maintained on Isordil and
hydralazine for pre and afterload reduction. Her ACE inhibitor
was held while on the Lasix strip. Metolazone also was used to
improve diuresis , and the patient was maintained on digoxin with
level checks every three days. The patient underwent an echo ,
which showed an EF of 15% , global akinesis with
moderate-to-severe MR , moderate TR , and no evidence of
dyssynchrony. The patient had moderate-to-severe RV dysfunction.
Rhythm: The patient was maintained on telemetry , especially
given the fact that she had no ICD in place. EP was consulted
and evaluated the patient for both an ICD and biventricular pacer
given no evidence of dyssynchrony on echo , it was decided that
the patient would undergo ICD placement only.
2. Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.1 on admission and was
monitored closely with diuresis. On admission , she had a normal
UA.
3. Heme: The patient was placed on heparin instead of Coumadin
for Chronicle device lead thrombus with a PTT goal of 60-80. The
patient's platelets dropped from 222 to 166 during this admission
and tests were ordered for the HIT antibody. The patient's
platelets normalized , but unfortunately , the PF4 was positive.
It was felt that this was a false positive and this was confirmed
with a Heme consult. Heme recommended rechecking the PF4 in
three to four weeks and holding heparin products until the PF4
was rechecked. The patient would be restarted on Coumadin after
her ICD placement.
4. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on sliding scale
insulin and Lantus for diabetes management.
5. GI: The patient had right upper quadrant pain on admission
likely related to a congested liver. A right upper quadrant
ultrasound showed a normal liver with thickened gall bladder
walls and ascites , and her symptoms were improved with diuresis.
The patient was maintained on Nexium for prophylaxis.
6. Psych: The patient was continued on citalopram and Ativan
for depression and anxiety. Psych was consulted for assistance
with management.
7. Musculoskeletal: The patient was maintained on probenecid
for gout.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient was on PPI and heparin until she
was on the HIT positive and was placed on Pneumoboots for
prophylaxis.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: To be determined at the time of
discharge.

Discharge Date: 5/17/1992
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. ASTHMA.
4. URINARY TRACT INFECTION.
5. HISTORY OF MELENA.
6. LOW BACK PAIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old black female
with a past history of hypertension
and congestive heart failure who presented to the emergency room
with increasing shortness of breath. In April 1991 , the patient
states that she had a bout of a cold with coughing and chills and
some substernal chest pressure. In October 1992 , the patient had
one 10-minute episode of substernal chest pain associated with
nausea , sweating and shortness of breath. Since then , she relates
increasing shortness of breath on exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , orthopnea and ankle edema. She also has been coughing up
more mucus and at times , blood-stained. She also complains of
dysuria for approximately the past month without hematuria. In
October 1992 , she had one episode of melena which lasted two
weeks. There is no history of peptic ulcer disease. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: Past medical history is remarkable for:
1. Asthma since early 20's. She was intubated once for asthma
in her early 20's.
2. Hypertension since she was a child.
3. History of congestive heart failure.
4. Hysterectomy secondary to fibroids at approximately age 20.
TAH , BSO.
5. Question of chronic renal insufficiency.
Medications at the time of admission are Lisinopril , Procardia ,
Albuterol nebulizer. Allergies are to IVP contrast. Family
history is positive for hypertension. Social history - she lives
with a 23-year-old son and just suffered a family tragedy in the
death of her youngest son who was shot to death three years ago.
Habits - she smokes 1/2 pack a day. She has over a 30-pack year
smoking history. She does not drink or engage in illicit drug use.
Review of systems is otherwise negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , this is a moderately obese
black female in moderate respiratory
distress. Temperature is afebrile , blood pressure 160/90 , pulse
84 , respiratory rat 32 , O2 saturation 97% on two liters nasal
prong. Head and neck exam showed significant jugular venous
distention. Chest showed diffuse expiratory wheezes , some use of
accessory muscles. Cardiovascular exam had an S1 and S2 with no
murmur. The abdomen was obese , otherwise benign. The liver edge
was 12.0 - 14.0 cm by percussion. Rectal exam was guaiac negative.
Extremities had no cyanosis or clubbing but 1+ bilateral ankle
edema. Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal. Musculoskeletal
exam - there was an area of left paravertebral tenderness in the
lumbar sacral spine area.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , hematocrit 35.1 , platelet
count 246 , 000 , white count 9000 with 65%
polys , 1% bands. ABG on unclear FIO-2 was pH 7.48/37/73/95.5%
saturation. SMA-7 was significant for a BUN 19 , creatinine 1.4. PT
12.3 , PTT 31.7. Urinalysis was positive for traced blood and
leukocytes , too numerous to count white blood cells , 7-10 red blood
cells and 4% bacteria on microscopy. Urine culture grew klebsiella
sensitive to Bactrim. EKG was sinus at a rate of 80 , axis -29
degrees , intervals of .196/.116/.1478 , marked left ventricular
hypertrophy with left atrial abnormality with strain pattern in
V3-V6. Chest X-ray was significant for moderate pulmonary edema.
Lumbar sacral plain films showed no significant bony disease. An
Echocardiogram showed a severe left ventricular hypertrophy ,
preserved systolic function , possible diastolic dysfunction and new
posterior wall hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Renal ultrasound showed both kidneys to
be approximately 11.0 cm in size. No
renal artery stenosis was seen though it was a limited study due to
body habitus. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was carried out by the GI
service and no significant lesions were found. The patient was
diuresed for congestive heart failure to which she responded well.
Her breathing was significantly improved by the second hospital
day. It is felt that her hypertension has contributed to at least
clinical evidence of her failure. While in the hospital , the blood
pressure was difficult to control and eventually required the use
of three medications. At the time of discharge , she was running
blood pressures in the range of 140-150 systolic and diastolic of
90 which is much improved for her. A repeat urine culture was
negative and the antibiotics were stopped. Her low back pain was
felt to be muscular in origin and she was given Flexeril for this.
She has no history of peptic ulcer disease but it has been decided
to institute a trial of H2 blocker therapy and reevaluate the need
for upper GI endoscopy in three weeks time. Her asthma was
relatively quiescent but it has been stressed to her that she
should continue to use her puffers.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is stable.
MEDICATIONS at the time of discharge are
Beclovent 4 puffs b.i.d. , Ventolin 2 puffs q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Habitrol nicotine patch q. day , Procardia XL 90 mg
p.o. q. day , Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q. day , Labetalol 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Flexeril 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day. The
patient will follow up at Asacil Calcdennatchbo Valley Hospital on 1/26/92 at 6:10
p.m. She also has an appointment with GI clinic here on 11/10/92
at 2:30 p.m.

ATTENDING: SIMKINS , WILFORD MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Chest pain/SOB.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: In brief , this is an 85-year-old man
with ischemic cardiomyopathy , atrial fibrillation , CRI , and prior
mitral valve replacement , and bioprosthesis presented with DE
compensated heart failure , increasing shortness of breath , and
chest pain. He has complex cardiovascular history and
progressive symptoms of heart failure. He had CABG in 1980 and
1990 and multiple PCI most recently in 6/29 with intervention on
SVG to the PDA. He had MVR in 1980 with bioprosthesis. He had
implantation of a CRT pacemaker with ICV function in 3/7 His
history of heart failure dates back ten years , but he has had
more marked decline over the past two years currently has SOB
typically , does not have orthopnea , PND , or leg edema. He has
been admitted to the Mid-lo Caldent Medical Center several times for
management of CHF in 1/14 After diuresis he states he could
walk up to 30 yards on a flat surface , but could not walk up
steps. He was at baseline until 3/29/05 when he had recurrent
episodes of chest pain respondive to sublingual nitroglycerin
associated with diaphoresis , nausea , palpitations , and
lightheadedness. On 10/17/05 , he had acute onset of shortness of
breath at rest after eating. He was admitted to the Ctr Medical Center and treated with diuresis and anticoagulation. MI was
excluded by serial enzymes. He was noted to be anemic. Other
lab values were consistent with hemolysis. As a part of his
workup , during ETT MIBI , he was able to walk 2 minutes 52 seconds
on the standard Bruce protocol , peak HR 94 , echo showed a dilated
LV , EF of 34% , mild global hypokinesis , and septal and apical
akinesis , enlarged dixed defect in the inferior apical wall with
moderate fixed defect in the inferior apical segment , and a small
amount of reversibility was noted in a mild inferior lateral
defect. Echocardiogram at CMC on 5/13 showed EF of 35% , septal
and apical akinesis , with normal RV function , mitral
bioprosthesis , mildly elevated antegrade velocities , mild
perivalvular regurgitation , moderate TR , moderate pulmonary
hypertension , SVP of 48 mmHg and PA plus RA pressure , transferred
for evaluation and management of chest pain at Slifarb Hospital with ? need for catheterization.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Married and lives with wife. Family very
involved. A former smoker , quit in 1980.
FAMILY HISTORY: Alcohol: No history of abuse. He is retired
supervisor in water department. Family history is otherwise
noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: NAD , 60s to 70s , afebrile , and BP is 100
to 110 over 50 to 60. Saturating at 89% on two liters , 94% on
four liters , JVD 12 , mild HJR , bronchial breath sounds , dullness
at bases , and no rales. Cardiac is irregularly regular 2/6 mid
peaking SVM , and 2/6 HSM at apex. Abdomen: Benign. No HSM.
Extremities are warm without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: EKG underlying atrial fibrillation with
ventricular pacing at 70. Labs of note , hematocrit 27 , BUN 38 ,
creatinine 1.8 , sodium 140 , BNP brain natriuretic peptide 482 , CK
61 , troponin 0.1 , haptoglobin less than assay , reticulocyte count

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Cardiovascular: An 84-year-old man with complex medical issues
elderly and debilitated currently with last three to four heart
failures secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. He has undergone
multiples attempts of revascularization including CABG x2 ,
repeated PCI , most recently in 6/29 with intervention on SVG.
Revascularization options at this point are quite limited , the
amount of active ischemic burden suggested by his recent
submaximal MIBI ETT is unlikely to account for the severity of
the symptoms that he is experiencing. Unfortunately , his overall
debilitated state makes surgical intervention unlikely to be
tolerated. He was moderately overloaded at the time of arrival
and was aggressively diuresed. An echocardiogram was performed
on 7/24/05 , which showed moderate known perivalvular mitral
valve leakage and an EF of 30%. A right heart catheterization
was performed on 8/23/05 which showed RA pressure 7/7 , mean 5;
RV 52/1 , mean 4; PA 54/17 , mean 34; and PW 21/40 , mean 23. In
summary , overall dry after aggressive diuresis; however , with
large amounts of mitral regurgitation. For this reason , it was
discussed with the family possible clamping for his mitral valve
as he is not a candidate for mitral valve replacement given his
end-stage heart and generally frail state. Plan as of the time
of this dictation is to undergo TEE on 2/18/05 to evaluate
whether clamping of the mitral valve would be possible and then
to have mitral valve clamping later this week. The patient was
diuresed effectively with Lasix 200 mg IV b.i.d. with metolazone.
The patient was also started on digoxin and Aldactone. He had a
bump in his creatinine to 2.2 on 10/3/05 and then it continued
to rise and for this reason diuresis was held as of 2/10/05. As
for rhythm , paced , normal sinus rhythm , on telemetry. O 2/6/05
brief round of V-tach , paced out of it. An AICD and pacer in
place.
Pulmonary: COPD. On O2 at home , however , with increased
desaturation here in the hospital to mid 80s while walking ,
thought secondary to his extreme mitral valve regurgitation. On
Advair , Combivent , and albuterol nebulizer.
Renal: Elevated creatinine in mid 2s , baseline CRI creatinine
1.5 , and all medications were renally dosed.
FEN: Potassium and Magnesium scales , b.i.d electrolytes given
diuresis.
Heme: Hemolytic anemia with bilirubin of 3.0 likely secondary to
mitral valve regurgitation , not surgical candidate , baseline
unknown. Given transfusion on 2/7/05. Transfuse for
hematocrit less than 30. PTT goal of 60 to 80 on heparin. He
will eventually be put on Coumadin.
CODE: Code status was changed during the time of this admission
to DNR/DNI/no pressors.
This is an interval dictation , please see addendum for remaining
hospital course and for discharge medications.

by PCP , presenting with CHF exacerbation concerning for ischemia.
Telemetry also notable for multiple runs of NSVT concerning for
ongoing ischemia.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Patient has an EF of 35%. When last examined in
2003 , on presentation , was volume overloaded. However , BP was
well controlled. Patient was diuresed with IV Lasix and then
converted to an oral regimen. Blood pressure was titrated as
well as heart rate for improved rate control. ACE inhibitor was
initially held in the setting of worsening renal function ,
however , restarted prior to discharge. A repeat echo on 7/25
revealed an EF of 35% with an akinetic septal and inferior wall;
hypokinetic anterior lateral and posterior wall as well as left
atrial enlargement. Aortic valve stenosis with a gradient of 17
and mean of 10 with moderate AF , MR , TR with a peak AP of 29 and
the right atrial pressure similar to the prior study in 2003.
Ischemia , patient also has a history notable for coronary artery
disease status post CABG. Although the patient denied ongoing
chest pain , given history of diabetes , we were concerned for
ongoing ischemia. However , enzymes were negative x 3 with
telemetry notable for multiple runs of NSVT , stretching 20 to 30
beats , concerning for ongoing ischemia. Patient underwent
cardiac cath on 5/25 , which was notable for a left main 70%
stenosed and LAD 100% stenosed , circumflex 90% stenosed , RCA 100%
stenosed , large one 100% stenosed with an intact LIMA to LAD
graft as well as an intact SVT to OM graft. Patient underwent
Rotablator and balloon to the left circumflex and the OM lesions
and the LAD , left circumflex , and OM were stented. Patient was
continued on aspirin , beta-blocker , and statin. Patient was
started on Plavix. Patient was instructed to remain on Plavix
until further notice. Patient has baseline AFib with runs of
NSVT , which improved significantly status post revascularization.
Rate control was improved with a regimen of beta-blocker and
amiodarone. Patient will be continued to be monitored on
telemetry.
PULMONARY: Patient oxygenated well throughout her hospital stay.
Patient was carefully diuresed in the setting of acute on
chronic renal insufficiency in the setting of a dye load. On
discharge , she is oxygenating well on room air.
HEME: Hematocrit remained stable throughout her hospital course.
Coumadin was initially discontinued to proceed with cardiac
cath; however , patient was restarted on Coumadin with PCP
followup to follow INR. At the time of discharge , the patient has
mild thrombocytopenia. PCP will continue to monitor.
ENDOCRINE: Patient has a history of diabetes mellitus , on
insulin , was continued during her hospital stay , increased her
Lantus dose secondary to suboptimal blood sugar control.
Hemoglobin A1c in April was noted to be 6 , indicative of good
control. Patient also has a history of hypothyroidism. TSH
within normal limits and she was continued on her current dose of
Levoxyl.
RENAL: Patient has acute on chronic renal failure , baseline
creatinine of 1.4 to 1.6 , likely secondary to poor forward flow.
Creatinine improved with diuresis. At the time of discharge ,
creatinine was in the range of 1.8. Currently , she will be
continued to be followed as an outpatient. Patient will be
started back on ACE inhibitor prior to discharge. Prior to
cardiac cath , the patient did receive bicarb and Mucomyst to aid
in renal protection. At p.m. , patient was maintained on a
cardiac food-restricted diet.
NEURO , OPHTHO: Status post cardiac cath , patient complained of
left blurry vision. Patient was evaluated by neurology and
ophthalmology , which revealed a left corneal abrasion. They
recommended no further imaging studies , however , one may consider
carotid ultrasound as an outpatient to further evaluate.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease
CHIEF COMPLAINT: This is a 76-year-old male without previous
cardiac history who is admitted with chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Cardiac risk factors include tobacco
smoking , hypertension and diabetes.
He has no family history , no history of hypercholesterolemia. He
had a negative stress test 10-12 years ago. Usual activity level
is to walk about a block a day. He has a history of severe
osteoarthritis of his neck. Today on the date of admission the
patient had a steroid injection in his cervical spine , which he
tolerated well. He did well until 5:30 p.m. when , while resting in
bed , he noted left-sided chest pain radiating to his left upper
arm , no shortness of breath , diaphoresis or palpitations. He did
not try any particular treatment and came to the emergency room.
The pain had increased in intensity to 10/10. In the emergency
room initial EKG showed T compression in V3-V6 , three lead. With 3
sublingual nitroglycerin and 2/10 , 5 mg IV Lopressor made him pain
free. There was no resolution of his ST changes. He had
recurrence of chest pain two hours later in the emergency room.
Left-sided chest pressure was similar quality to the previous while
lying on the stretcher. His EKG showed flattened T wave changes in
V4-V6 , ST depression 1 mm V4-V6 , evolved he had a T wave inversion
in V3-V6 when pain free. He was started on heparin and IV
nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes hypertension , adult onset diabetes
mellitus , history of renal calculi , benign
prostatic hypertrophy , increased triglycerides , history of malaria
and typhus and dengue fever , history of proteinuria.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Captopril , Micronase and Darvon p.r.n.

drinks alcohol , no family history of cardiac
disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Shows a vigorous white male who looks
younger than his stated age. Pulse 54 ,
blood pressure 107/53 , sat of 95% on room air. Physical exam was
notable only for a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , with
positive S4.
ADMITTING LABORATORY: Significant only for CK of 210. His CKs
never got higher than 210; however , cardiac
component of 1.7 , it was considered that the patient had ruled in
for non Q wave myocardial infarction.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 11/10/95 the patient underwent cardiac
catheterization. He had mildly elevated
right-sided pressures and showed three vessel disease of the 70%
proximal left anterior descending , 90% apical stenosis. He had a

luminal irregularities. Posterior descending artery was noted to
have a 90% mid stenosis. Systolic function showed EF of 71%. On
11/10/95 the patient underwent successful balloon angioplasty of the
proximal 95% stenosis of the left circumflex. On 8/4 the patient
complained of chest pressure , underwent an exercise tolerance test ,
5 minutes and 1 second , stopping secondary to leg fatigue. He had
2 mm ST segment depressions consistent with severe coronary artery
disease. On 11/1/95 the patient underwent a second cardiac
catheterization followed by successful angioplasty of his mid

ATTENDING: WHITEY , OSWALDO MD
SERVICE: Et Sa Rill
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Acute and chronic renal failure and
congestive heart failure.
OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES CONSIDERED: Type 2 diabetes ,
hyperlipidemia , acute and chronic renal insufficiency , upper GI
bleed with gastritis , ischemic cardiomyopathy , gout , sacral
decubitus ulcer.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Slauson is a 60-year-old
man with a known history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and CHF , EF
of 35% , status post CABG in 1990 with redo in September 2005 , as well
as mitral and tricuspid valve repair and left atrial
reconstruction in September 2005. He presented asymptomatic from home
after being called by his primary cardiologist as the lab result
showed elevated BUN and creatinine at 244/4.1. This all occurred
in the setting of increased diuresis on torsemide , increasing the
dose from 100 mg by mouth twice daily to 150 mg by mouth twice
daily as well as a recent addition of Keflex for sacral decubitus
ulcer. On further questioning , Mr. Satoe reported symptoms of
increasing dyspnea on exertion with decreased exercise tolerance
as well as chronic loose stools with a history of C-diff
positivity but negative on last testing. He denied any chest
pain , pleurisy , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and both he and
his family denied any change in mental status as well as
hematuria or dysuria , although he did complain of mild urinary
hesitancy. Prior to presentation , he was directed to hold his
diuretics , included torsemide as well as all other nephrotoxic
agents including allopurinol , colchicine , digoxin , and
lisinopril.
His allergies include heparin to which he has heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia.
In terms of medication reactions during this hospitalization , he
was placed on H. pylori treatment with amoxicillin ,
clarithromycin , and Nexium twice daily; and in reaction to this ,
he had mild elevation of his liver function tests.
BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL: Mr. Blackmer is A&O x3 with a BP of
90/60 , heart rate of 84. His lungs are bilaterally clear. His
heart exam shows a regular S1 , S2. Faint S3 with a 1/6
holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex with a JVD of 12 cm
plus V waves. His abdomen is benign. Extremities show no edema ,
but a left lower extremity petechial rash. He is found to be
heme positive with tarry stool , and he has a stable stage 4
sacral decubitus ulcer , well granulated without clear evidence of
infection.
Admission labs are significant for creatinine of 3.6 , BUN of 239 ,
potassium of 5.8 , digoxin of 1.7 , hematocrit of 29.3 , INR 4.1.
Admission EKG showed sinus rhythm with a first degree AV block.
Stable Q's in II , III , aVF , as well as V4 to V6. Left axis
deviation and right bundle branch block and an unchanged ST
depression in V2.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: 11/19/2005 , right heart
catheterization with PA line removal on 6/1/2005. 9/10/2005 ,
upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. 6/12/2005 , echocardiogram.
6/12/2005 , renal ultrasound.
HOSPPITAL COURSE:
1. Mr. Kristin presented with acute and chronic renal failure
with baseline BUN and creatinine at approximately 66/2.4 with a
rapid rise between presentation and the last noted value on
11/15/2005. Although , he was asymptomatic and did not have any
EKG changes , he was treated with Kayexalate and sodium
bicarbonate which resulted in rapid normalization of potassium.
The superelevation of his BUN was thought in part to be due to
possible over diuresis but also complicated by the fact that he
had Hemoccult positive stool as suspicious for a GI bleed as a
source of increased nitrogen. The renal service was consulted
and initial treatment of his acute renal failure included the
above plus removal of all fluid restriction and diuresis in order
to reverse any potential prerenal state. Essentially , all urine
and renal studies including eosinophils and renal ultrasound were
negative with a renal ultrasound showing normal kidneys without
hydronephrosis but without increased resistance in the feet
bilaterally. At the time of discharge , his creatinine and BUN
had fallen to 1.9/81 respectively and remained stable over days.
The initial renal diet restrictions imposed during the
hospitalization were removed towards the end of the stay with
persistently stable values as well.
2. From a cardiovascular standpoint , a repeat echo on 9/12
showed an EF of 35 to 40 with inferior wall and inferior septal
severe hypo to akinesis as well as posterior wall severe
hypokinesis with trace aortic insufficiency , 1+ mitral valve
regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid valve regurgitation but normal left
ventricular size and thickness as well as normal right
ventricular size function. In order to better assess his filling
pressures and fluid status and attempt to optimize his renal
function , Mr. Marthaler underwent a right heart cath with PA line
placement on 11/19/2005 which revealed elevating filling
pressures including right atrium at 26 to 27 , right ventricle
65/13 , PA 64/32 , wedge 36. Pulmonary artery sat 39% , SVR 1568 ,
and pulmonary vascular resistance 221. His cardiac output and
index were both reduced. The PA line was left in for tailor
therapy , and he was initially placed on nesiritide drip at 0.005
as well as a Lasix drip with good urine output and increase in
his cardiac output and index and decrease in his elevated
systemic vascular resistance. On 10/6/2005 , the nesiritide drip
was discontinued and Lasix continued with the addition of
short-acting nitrates in the form of Isordil. Eventually , he was
transferred from the Lasix drip to torsemide reaching optimal
dose of 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. on 2/10/2005 , and further tailoring
with Imdur 30 and hydralazine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for further
afterload reduction were preformed. Lisinopril previously used
on admission was continuously held given the recent acute renal
failure.
3. From an ischemic standpoint , there were no active issues
during the hospitalization. His beta blocker was reduced to 12.5
briefly , but his normal dose of 25 once a day was resumed prior
to discharge. In terms of his rate , it was well controlled on
the above regimen , but his rhythm showed frequent ectopy without
response to diuresis or beta blockade. He does have an ICD in
place which never fired during the course of the hospitalization.
Upon discharge , he was close to euvolemia with an approximate
discharge weight of 67.6 kg.
4. From a GI standpoint , his initial presentation included
heme-positive tarry stools with elevated BUN. He was seen by the
GI service and underwent a colonscopy and upper EGD which were
significant for gastritis without signs of active bleeding as
well as internal hemorrhoids. H. pylori serologies were
positive , and he was initially started on clarithromycin ,
amoxicillin , and Nexium b.i.d. , but this regimen was changed to
amoxicillin , Flagyl , and Nexium b.i.d. given an elevation of his
LFTs on the prior regimen. There was no overt GI bleeding , and
he tolerated the procedure without complication.
5. From a nutrition standpoint , Mr. Splatt was seen by a
nutrition specialist who confirmed suspicion of suboptimal
caloric intake meeting his total caloric needs about only 60% and
total protein needs are 85% despite labilization of his diet and
the addition of Megace. His nutritional goals were even more
important given his large stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer with
poor healing since January 2005. Despite encouragement and the
addition of appetite stimulants with vitamin C , zinc , mineral ,
multivitamins , and the addition of supplements , he presently fell
short of his goals but refused other means of diet
supplementation including NG tube placement and PEG placement and
is determined to provide adequate p.o. intake by mouth. He and
his family met with a registered dietitian and understand the
importance of his caloric intakes.
6. From a musculoskeletal point of view , he has stage 4 sacral
decubitus ulcer which is followed by plastic surgery and
frequently debrided as an outpatient , Dr. Bastress and his team ,
followed the patient while inhouse , and it was treated as per
protocol with b.i.d. dressing changes with Panafil and wet-to-dry
dressings. Initially , he was started on Keflex for suspicion of
infection in the wound , and this was changed to vancomycin given
MRSA growth in the wound and further Klebsiella growth which was
treated with levofloxacin , but these were all discontinued on
10/6/2005 as per plastic recommendations given the high
probability colonization. It was also felt that these
antibiotics would provide appropriate coverage for the possible
right lower lobe infiltrate questioned on x-ray.
7. From an endocrinology standpoint , he has a history of diabetes
type 2 , and he was continued on his Lantus and NovoLog insulin
sliding scale with titration of optimal glucose control in order
to promote wound healing. He was followed by the diabetes
management team.
8. From rheumatologic standpoint , he has a history of gout , and
he was maintained on allopurinol , renal dosing , but colchicine
helps. On about 1/6/2005 , he developed symptoms of podagra ,
and a prednisone taper starting at 15 mg was started with quick
resolution of symptoms.
9. From hematologic standpoint , he has anemia baseline and takes
Procrit once a week as an outpatient. He received 1 unit of
packed red blood cell transfusion on 8/18 and maintained his
hematocrit throughout the remainder of the hospitalization. He
was also maintained on darbepoetin as an inpatient.
Laboratory data showed no evidence of hemolysis with a normal
haptoglobin and LDH , but evidence of decreased iron saturation.
He was started on iron supplementation , and his Coumadin was held
for the supratherapeutic levels on admission and optimize prior
to discharge.
PERTINENT EXAM ON DISCHARGE: Patient was afebrile with stable
vital signs. He did have decreased breath sounds at the right
base know to correspond with his small right basilar opacity with
atelectasis. Other than that , his heart exam remained unchanged
with a regular rhythm , S1 and S2 , S3 , with a 1/6 holosystolic
murmur at the apex. His JVD was 11 cm , and he had no peripheral
edema.
Discharge lab showed a creatinine of 1.9 with a BUN of 81 ,
potassium of 3.6 , hematocrit 32.1 , white blood cell count 9000.
His digoxin level was normal at 0.8 , and his INR was 3.
CONSULTATNTS: Dr. Bingaman from Ox Derd Peake , Dr. Crisan from GI , Dr.
Whidbee from plastic surgery , Armando Mishulovin from nutrition , as
well as the diabetic management service.
DISCARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg by mouth daily , albuterol 2
puffs inhale 4 times a day as needed for shortness of breath
relieving , allopurinol 150 mg by mouth daily , amoxicillin 1000 mg

month.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient had three weeks of cold
like symptoms , which progressively worsened. Initially , she had
a sore throat and mild headache that progressed to a
sputum-productive cough. She has been in orthopnea at baseline
but has become increasingly short of breath and requiring more
frequent inhaler treatments. She went to her primary care
physician last week and got azithromycin for presumed pulmonary
infection. She completed antibiotic course but over the past few

4.6 , hematocrit 45.8 , platelets 256. LFTs within normal limits.
Coags within normal limits. BNP 46 , CK-MB 0.9 , troponins
negative. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , T-wave inversions , V3
through V5. Chest x-ray shows enlarged heart with right middle
lobe opacity.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Pulmonary: The patient with possible right middle lobe
pneumonia versus CHF versus exacerbation versus COPD versus PE.
The patient is found to have pneumonia. She is afebrile with
normal white blood cell counts but continues to be hypoxic to the
mid 80s on room air. Sputum cultures were sent and the patient
was treated empirically with Levaquin. Levaquin was given for a
total of 8 doses in-house and the patient will continue for a
total of 14-day course. The patient had a PECT , which was
initially read was positive , however , the final read was negative
for PE. The patient initially received a dose of Lovenox 100 mg
b.i.d. but was discontinued given negative PE. The patient was
seen by Pulmonary Service who performed the bronchoscopy on
6/14/05 , which showed a copious blood-tinged mucosa and
collapsed right middle lobe lung with narrow orifice. Brushings
and cytology were taken and sent to Pathology and the results are
still pending. The patient's pulmonary function test showed
severe obstructive disease with the FEV of 0.9 with some aspects
of restrictive disease. She also underwent a bubble study , which
was negative for heart septal defects. The PA pressure was
estimated at 42. The patient then underwent a right heart
catheterization to check for vasodilator response and heart
function. This was performed on 10/10/05 , which showed high
right-sided heart pressures and a pulmonary wedge pressure of
16-18 and suggested that the patient was not in acute left heart
failure. The patient was also seen by the Ookter Highway ,
Pulmonary Hypertension Consult Service , whose impressions were
that the patient's poor pulmonary function is due to COPD and
pectus cavernosum as well as radiation for breast cancer and is
chronic condition. No indication was present for treatment with
primary pulmonary antihypertensive agents. The patient then had
a repeat chest x-ray on 10/10/05 to evaluate for the right middle
lobe , which continues to be collapsed. The patient was stable on
2-3 L of nasal cannula oxygen , saturating at about middle 90s.
The patient was re-evaluated by physical therapy on 3/29/05 and
was found to not need any particular treatments at home. The
patient was discharged to home with home O2 2-3 nasal cannula and
instructed to keep O2 saturations above 88%. The patient does
work in the hospital. The patient's work situation and
disability regarding her lung condition was discussed by the
attending physician.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient is stable with no evidence of
acute CHF , complicating dyspnea. The BNP was normal and JVP
remained relatively flat throughout her hospital course. The
patient was continued on her outpatient hypertensive medications ,
which was captopril and that was given t.i.d. with good control.
The patient was also on Lasix 40 mg daily , which was then
increased to 60 on day of discharge to encourage gentle diuresis.
3. Endocrine: The patient has diet-controlled diabetes at home.
She was on insulin sliding scale and house and required only
several units of insulin a day. Her blood sugars remained in the
mid 100s.
The patient was on Levoxyl 225 mcg daily in-house and was found
to have a increased TSH of 10.5 , therefore dose of Levoxyl was
increased to 250 mcg. The patient is instructed to follow up
with her primary care provider and her endocrinologist in two
weeks to recheck a TSH.
4. Musculoskeletal: The patient complaining of leg cramps ,
chest spasms , and back pain. Back pain appears chronic. Chest
spasms appeared to be musculoskeletal in etiology and not
cardiac. The patient was on oxycodone 5 mg q.4h. p.r.n. and then
transitioned to OxyContin 10 mg b.i.d. with good pain control.
5. Social Services: The patient was seen by Social Services
regarding prescription coverage , ability to handle copayments.
Additionally , her concerns regarding short-term disability and
long-term disability for work were addressed. The patient is to
inquire with her benefit office to determine for services.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with home O2.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Levaquin 500 mg daily for six more days ,
captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 60 mg p.o. daily ,
levothyroxine 250 mcg p.o. daily , Xanax 0.25 mg t.i.d. p.r.n. ,
OxyContin 10 mg p.o. q.12h. , Combivent 1-2 puffs q.i.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient to call if becoming short of
breath , has chest pain , fever over 100.5 or any other concerns or
questions.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: Include 10/17/05 at Bayhead Medical Center for
sleep study where the patient is to arrive before 09:00 p.m. that
night , 10/25/05 with Dr. Chesterman at 02:30 p.m. for primary care
follow-up , Dr. Hilse on 7/18/05 at 04:00 p.m. for follow-up of
pulmonary issues and a two weeks' time follow-up with her
endocrinologist regarding her thyroid condition.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: COPD , pneumonia , secondary pulmonary hypertension ,

ATTENDING: RANDOLPH DAN OPHEIM MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 66-year-old gentleman who was noted to have an
abnormal electrocardiogram during preoperative testing for his
right shoulder surgery. The patient underwent stress test , which
showed areas of ischemia. The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on 8/28/04 which revealed a left anterior
descending coronary artery with an osteal 90% stenosis , the ramus
coronary artery with an ostial 70% stenosis , first diagonal
coronary artery with a mid 90% stenosis , a 3rd diagonal coronary
artery with an ostial 80% stenosis , left circumflex coronary
artery with a proximal 75% stenosis , right coronary artery with a
50% ostial stenosis , posterior descending coronary artery with a
proximal 90% stenosis , a right dominant circulation and right
renal artery stenosis of 75 80%. Echocardiogram on 4/6/04
revealed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral insufficiency ,
trivial tricuspid insufficiency , low normal to borderline reduced
overall left ventricular systolic function , not quantified. The
patient has a history of atrial fibrillation which was treated in
the past with propafenone which is currently resolved and he has
history of myocardial infarction. He also has a history of class
III heart failure with marked limitation of physical activity.
PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension , non-insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus , dyslipidemia , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,
benign prostatic hypertrophy and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ,
no known episodes since 1995 , nephrolithiasis , and bursitis of
his right shoulder. History of hepatitis type unknown and renal
artery stenosis and renal insufficiency. He is status post left
rotator cuff repair in 1991.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has allergies to procainamide which causes diarrhea
and arthralgias and verapamil which causes difficulty
concentrating and constipation.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Toprol 25 mg once a day , lisinopril 10 mg once a day , propafenone
150 mg once a day enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg once a day ,
Rhinocort , simvastatin 20 mg once a day , metformin 500 mg once a
day , and glyburide 5 mg twice a day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Cardiac exam regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or
heaves , peripheral vascular 2+ pulses bilaterally throughout.
Respiratory breath sounds clear bilaterally , is otherwise
noncontributory.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was brought to the operating room on 10/19/04 where
he underwent an urgent coronary artery bypass graft x5 with left
internal mammary to left anterior descending coronary artery
saphenous vein graft to the first diagonal coronary artery. A
right internal mammary artery to the ramus coronary artery , a
left radial artery to the second left ventricular branch and
sequential to the first left ventricular branch. Total bypass
time was 159 minutes , total cross clamp time 110 minutes. The
patient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass without
incident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus
rhythm and stable condition with intravenous insulin.
Postoperatively , the patient did show his atrial fibrillation and
atrial flutter which was treated Lopressor , diltiazem ,
propafenone. He was extubated and placed on his preoperative
inhalers for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He did
have a left-sided pleural effusion which was tapped on 1100 cc of
bloody fluid on 3/26/04. Post-tap chest x-ray revealed a small
left residual effusion and no pneumothorax. The patient was
slightly hypertensive due to renal artery stenosis and initially
low urine output. Renal ultrasound revealed equal size kidneys
and no hydronephrosis. His oliguria was blood pressure dependent
and he did resume urination without use of diuretics. The
patient was also followed by the diabetes mellitus service for
his non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and was put back on
his preoperative dose of glipizide. The patient was transferred
to the step-down unit on postoperative day #6. He did complain
on 5/11/04 of left eye black spot in the middle of his left eye.
The patient was seen by the ophthalmology service which was felt
that this was due to his diabetic retinopathy. The patient will
follow up as an outpatient with his local ophthalmologist; his
symptoms have resolved. The patient required vigorous diuresis
and was sent home on Lasix 20 mg once a day for 5 days.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. ISCHEMIC HEPATOCELLULAR INJURY.
2. ALCOHOL ABUSE.
3. ALCOHOLIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Vomiting , fever , and chills for 18 hours prior to
admission and a cough.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51 year old
African-American female with a history
of long-standing alcohol abuse with two episodes of alcoholic
pancreatitis in the past. She is status post T2 , N1 floor of the
mouth squamous cell carcinoma. This was treated with resection and
XRT. She presents with vomiting x 18 hours. The patient was in
her usual state of health until two days prior to admission when
she began to develop upper respiratory infection symptoms with
congestion and a productive cough. The cough was initially
productive of white sputum and then later which turned dark in
color. She denies any blood tinged sputum or rust colored sputum.
The patient's cough and upper respiratory infection symptoms
progressed and she began to feel weak. On the morning prior to
admission , the patient awoke from sleep with a coughing fit and
subsequently vomited. She denies any hematemesis at that time.
She repeatedly had episodes of vomiting over the next 28 hours
prior to admission and was unable to drink liquids without
vomiting. She reports that she took approximately eight to ten
Tylenol 500 mg tablets prior to admission for her symptoms. She
became progressively light-headed and dizzy , especially with
standing up. She reports subjective fevers although she did not
take her temperature , and also night sweats. She had one episode
of diarrhea which was nonbloody and loose. Her son , who is an
employee of the Hos Medical Center cafeteria , went to
visit her and urged her to go to the emergency room.
In the emergency room , the patient was initially triaged to the
emergent side of the EW , was found to have a blood pressure of
77/50 with a pulse of 138. She was transferred to the acute side
for management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Notable of alcohol pancreatitis in September
of 1998 and April of 1997. 2. Squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck , as previously noted , status post
excision in 1994 with XRT and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. She is
also status post multiple dental extractions and one flap revision.
3. History of total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy in 1985. 4. History of small bowel
obstruction , status post lysis of adhesions , getting an exploratory
laparotomy in September 1997.
ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: None.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: One to three cigarettes per day and one-half to
one pint of brandy each day for ""a long time.""
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per history of present illness. She denies
any orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ,
lower extremity edema , chest pain , or shortness of breath. As far
as she knows , she has no known cardiac history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was relatively well-appearing in no
apparent distress. Her temperature was
98.0. Her blood pressure was 110/84 , her pulse was 101. Her
respiratory rate was 16 and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
HEENT: Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodation; extraocular muscles intact; sclera were muddy
without icterus. Oropharynx was notable for postsurgical changes
on the right side and with dry mucous membranes. Neck: Notable
for no meningismus and jugular venous pressure of approximately 5
cm. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart:
Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , gallops , or rubs
auscultated and a nondisplaced point of maximal intensity.
Abdomen: Soft with mild left upper quadrant tenderness , but no
hepatic tenderness. The liver edge was nonpalpable. There was no
spleen tip palpable and bowel sounds were present. The extremities
were notable for no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema and were warm and
perfuse. Neurologically , she was alert and oriented x 3 with
intact cranial nerve. Her strength and sensation were grossly
intact , 5/5 in the upper and lower extremities. Her toes were
down-going bilaterally and her reflexes were symmetric in the upper
and lower extremities. Rectal examination was guaiac negative.
DATA: Laboratory values upon admission showed electrolytes within
normal limits. Magnesium was 1.1. White count 6.5 ,
hematocrit 48 , platelets 200. Differential: 78 polys , 1 band , 12
lymphs and 8 monos. MCV was 104. RDW was 14. ALT 140 , AST 605 ,
alkaline phosphatase 119 , and total bilirubin was 2.6 with a direct
fraction of 1.5. Lipase was 319 , amylase was 44. Her INRs were
1.1 and her prothrombin time was 19.9 Troponin was 0.22.
Chest x-ray was notable for no infiltrates or evidence of heart
failure.
EKG was notable for sinus tachycardia at 117 with a Q-wave of 3 and
Q-wave in V2 and V3. Q-wave inversions were noted in V3 and V6
with no chest pain.
Urinalysis was notable for 2+ protein , trace keto , 3+ blood , 2+
leukocyte esterase , 28 to 30 whites and 2+ squamous cells.
ASSESSMENT: In the emergency room , the patient was acutely treated
for presumed sepsis and received a dose of ceftriaxone
and clindamycin. Urinalysis results indicated that she had a
potential urinary tract infection at that time. Blood cultures
were drawn and the patient received IV hydration. Her EKG was
noted to have new T-wave inversions as compared to previously with
an indeterminate troponin. She was admitted to medicine for
management.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's hospital course can be summarized
as follows:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient has no known cardiac history. Her
cardiac risk factors include cigarette smoking and postmenopausal
female , age 51. No diabetes mellitus. No known
hypercholesterolemia. No known family history. She does , however ,
drink heavily and has done so for a number of years. She has no
known cardiotoxic effect secondary to alcohol.
The T-wave inversions were noted with an indeterminate troponin.
The patient was admitted in a rule out protocol. She ruled out for
an myocardial infarction with serial CKs which were all below 50.
Her T-wave inversions persisted despite resolution of her sinus
tachycardia. An echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated
dilated left ventricle of 5.6 cm and an ejection fraction of 25 to
30% with inferoseptal and inferoseptal apical akinesis. No
ventricular thrombus was noted.
Cardiology consultation service was asked to see the patient to
evaluation her in the setting of her new depressed ejection
fraction and focal wall motion abnormalities. Initially , she was
presumed to have coronary disease which had been clinically silent
prior to this. She was treated with aspirin , Lopressor and
Captopril 6.25 mg three times a day. Unfortunately , the patient's
blood pressure did not tolerate this antihypotensive regimen and ,
despite efforts to scale it back in dosages , the majority of the
medicines were held. Nevertheless , the patient's heart rate slowed
to the 60s. She experienced one episode of burning chest pain on
the night of admission which was alleved with Maalox. There were
no EKG changes associated with that pain.
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab on September
The cardiac catheterization was notable for a right atrial
pressure of 5. Right ventricular pressure of 36/10. Pulmonary
artery pressure was 35/13 , and the pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 16. Her cardiac output was 6.13 with an index of
3.69. The left heart catheterization noted normal coronary
arteries without evidence of significant coronary disease. Her
left ventriculogram also noted a preserved ejection fraction with
no focal wall motion abnormalities. Dr. Garret Dalrymple of the
cardiac consultation service followed the patient in house and felt
that the reversal of her wall motion abnormalities could be
attributable to the acute effects of alcoholic cardiotoxicity. The
patient will be discharged on aspirin for primary prevention of
coronary disease , as her other medications were discontinued. The
patient was heparinized for her apical wall motion abnormality and
low ejection fraction while in house and the heparin was
discontinued at the time of catheterization.
2. GI: The patient presented with an acute elevation of her
transaminases. The patient's transaminases were noted to be less
than 10 in September of 1998. Initially , it was felt that these
transaminases might reflect alcoholic hepatitis given her
significant alcohol history. The patient reports that her last
drink was on Sunday prior to admission. She drinks about a pint of
brandy every day. The patient's transaminases continued to rise ,
however. The diagnosis of acute Tylenol toxicity superimposed upon
hepatocellular damage from alcoholic hepatitis was also
entertained. She was empirically started on naphthyl cystine and
received approximately two to three doses , however , that medication
was discontinued upon GI consultation. The patient's transaminases
rose to a level of approximately 4000 AST and 1000 ALT , and the GI
service was consulted. The patient's hepatitic serologies were
sent and were notable for positive hepatitis B core antigen ,
whereas the rest of her hepatitis serologies including hepatitis C ,
hepatitis A and hepatitis B surface antigen were negative. The GI
service felt that her hepatocellular injury was most likely
attributable to an ischemic ""shock liver"" condition. She had a
right upper quadrant ultrasound as well which demonstrated a
dilatation of the common bile duct to 1 cm with some biliary
sludging but no evidence of obstructive lesions. Given the
patient's isolated increase in AST and ALT and bilirubin without an
increase in alkaline phosphatase , the diagnosis of ischemic
hepatotoxicity was entertained by the GI service. On the date of
discharge , the patient's ALT had fallen to 221 and her AST had
fallen to 50. Her total bilirubin had fallen to 1.1. The patient
was asymptomatic from hepatic perspective throughout her
hospitalization without any evidence of encephalopathy or
asterixis. An isolated ammonia level was sent and it was 45.
3. Infectious disease: The patient had a repeat urinalysis that
was sent on the morning following admission which was indicative of
urinary tract infection. Urine culture eventually indicated an
infection with Enterococcus. The patient received seven days of
ampicillin while in house , following her initial first day dosing
of ceftriaxone and clindamycin. The patient's urinary tract
infection clear symptomatically. She developed a yeast infection
in her vulvar area secondary to antibiotic therapy and this was
treated with topical Nystatin. The patient was not discharged on
antibiotics as she clinically cleared her infection.
4. FVN: The patient had persistent hypomagnesemia while in house
and required significant magnesium repletion. The etiology of this
hypomagnesemia was unclear; however , it was attributable to her
chronic alcohol use and depletion of total magnesium stores. Her
electrolytes clearly need to be followed closely as an outpatient.
5. Hematologic: The patient's INR slightly increased while in
house but this is attributable to heparin bolus and
supratherapeutic prothrombin time. Upon discharge , the patient's
INR had normalized. She received vitamin K 10 mg x 3 days as
empiric treatment for vitamin K depletion secondary to chronic
alcoholism as well as the possibility for hepatic synthetic
dysfunction.
6. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation for
hypotension was attributable to dehydration; however , it became
clear that the patient normally exists with a low normal blood
pressure of approximately 80 to 100 systolic. It was stressed to
the patient that she must maintain adequate p.o. intake to maintain
her circulating blood volume , as she seemed to be intolerant to the
antihypotensive medicines that were used for cardioprotection. A
random cortisol was drawn and was normal. The issue of potential
renal insufficiency was most likely excluded. The patient will
follow-up on endocrine and electrolyte issues with her primary
doctor.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q.day , Nystatin
topical cream , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
multivitamin one q.day and aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Elroy Forcell in
MES GEERT MEDICAL CENTER on March . Dr. Aamodt was involved in the
patient's hospitalization and will provide excellent continuity of
care as an outpatient.

Mr. Lewter is a 65-year-old gentleman with history of
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,
dyslipidemia , and peripheral vascular disease who presented to
Tci Prosamp Memorial Hospital on 5/23/06 with unstable angina. The patient
reports that he had been having intermittent left-sided chest
pressure at rest over the past three days associated with
shortness of breath , each episode lasting approximately 10
minutes. EKG on admission revealed sinus tachycardia with a new
incomplete left bundle-branch block and downsloping 1-1.5 mm ST
depressions in V3 through V6 and 1 mm depression in aVL. The
patient was deemed to have a NSTEMI and unstable angina. He was
not heparinized due to the fact that he was on Coumadin for
peripheral vascular disease with a therapeutic INR. On 11/26/06 , the patient
underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed the following: Left
circumflex coronary artery with an ostial 100% stenosis , left
anterior descending coronary artery with a proximal 60% stenosis
and a mid 50% stenosis , right coronary artery with a proximal 80%
stenosis and a mid 60% stenosis , right dominant circulation ,

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Jana was brought to the operating room on 3/26/06 where he
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x3 with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery , a
sequential graft and a vein graft connecting from the aorta to
the second obtuse marginal coronary artery and then to the left
ventricular branch. Total bypass time was 55 minutes , total
crossclamp time was 46 minutes. The patient did well
intraoperatively , came off bypass without incident , was brought
to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm and in stable
condition. Postoperatively , the patient did well. His CK-MB
trended down and EKG normalized. The patient's postop chest x-ray
revealed moderate-to-severe pulmonary venous congestion bibasally
requiring vigorous pulmonary toilet. The patient was extubated on
1/5/06. The patient was also followed by the Diabetes Mellitus
Service for his non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. His
blood glucoses were well controlled. He was started back on his
oral medication of glipizide 5 mg and was covered with a NovoLog
sliding scale. The patient was transfused 3 units of packed red
blood cells postoperatively , and was re-started on Coumadin for his
peripheral vascular disease. The patient's platelet count
dropped to as low as 59 , 000. He had a HIT panel sent off which
came back negative and platelets trended up at time of discharge
to 143 , 000. Mr. Gier was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on
postoperative day #3. His pacing wires were removed , and he was
screened for rehabilitation for discharge. The patient also had
some urinary retention postoperatively and did require Foley
reinsertion and was started on Flomax 0.4 mg once a day. He
failed a second voiding trial and will be discharged with a leg

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
--HPI: Mr. Gump is a 77yo African American male with PMH notable for COPD ,
HTN , NIDDM and recent PNA who presented to SHH ED on 4/15/05 via EMS with a
CC of SOB x 3d. He was seen 2 days earlier at the Dis.ry Medical Center where he
was diagosed with pneumonia and given Azithromycin. The day of admissio
he said his breathing felt more labored and he contacted EMS to take him to
the CHA ED. He also reported worsening exercise tolerance and an increase
in bilateral lower extremity edema over the past few months , accompanied by
a 20lb weight gain. He also noted left sided pleuritic pain made worse by
physical movement and deep breathing. He was treated in the ED with
supplemental O2 and Levofloxacin and admitted with a diagnosis of COPD flare
and right heart failure.

--Hospital course:
1. ) Pulm- Pt treated for COPD flare with supplemental O2 , DuoNebs , and
steroids. Since he reported left sided pleuritic chest pain , we evaluated
the possibility of PE with a V/Q scan that reported a low probability of PE.
2. ) CV- Pt's physical exam demonstrated signs of right-sided heart failure ,
notably 12 cm JVD , hepatomegaly and later hepatojugular reflex , and 2+
bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. We proceeded to treat his heart
failure by diuresis with Lasix , initially PO and then IV. Overall , he
diuresed approximately 1L fluid. To further evaluate his heart failure , a
cardiac MRI was obtained and demonstrated normal cardiac anatomy and
function. His LVEF was 73% and he had no valvular dysfunction.
3. ) ID- Sputum was cultured which showed few polys , moderate cocci , 2+
suspected oral flora. Since he remained afebrile and did not demonstrate an
elevated WBC , we did not treat with antibiotics.
4. ) Endo- His diabetes was managed with his home regimen of Novolog.
Steroids may have contributed to his elevated blood sugars. In a previous
discharge summary , it was noted that he had an elevated TSH level. We
followed up on this by rechecking his TSH , which was normal.
5. ) Renal- He an elevated baseline level of Cr. We monitored his Cr and
BUN for an increase with diuresis. While the BUN increased to the low 30s ,
his Cr was stable.
6. ) Prophylaxis- Chronic pain and insomnia were managed with his out-pt
regimen of morphine and oxycodone. He was given Elavil for sleep. Because
of his history of cancer , he was placed on Lovenox for anticoagulation.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please use your home oxygen when you are sleeping at night. We have added
combivent inhalers and a steroid taper to your medicines. Please stop the
hydrochlorathiazide ( hctz ) 25mg. Instead you will be taking lasix 20mg
once a day.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
- Continue Lasix 40mg PO QD at home and D/C home HTCZ.
- Slow Prednisone taper over next 20 days.
- Have PCP address management of HTN medications and OSA. Check lytes on
new dose of lasix. Consider adding ACE inhibitor considering hx of NIDDM.
Episodic hypoxia while sleeping may contribute to pulmonary HTN and signs
of right heart failure observed.

Discharge Date: 5/16/1998
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CHEST PAIN.
PROBLEM LIST: 1 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2 ) HYPOTHYROIDISM.
3 ) PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70 year-old woman who
had coronary artery bypass graft in
1993 who presents with ten minutes of acute chest pain today. In
August of 1992 , she had quadruple bypass surgery with LIMA to the
LAD and saphenous vein graft to the PDA , OM2 and diagonal branch.
She was feeling generally well until the beginning of April at
home. From June , 1997 to January , 1997 , she was in
O and began to experience intermittent episodes of diaphoresis.
These tended to occur with ambulation on a flat surface , although
she did have one episode that awakened her from sleep. The second
time this happened , she went to the Faxtpaul Dekan Health Care there in Ton
with the complaints of diaphoresis and some nausea , although she
did not have chest pain , shortness of breath , vomiting or
palpitations. No EKG was done at the time. She said that she was
definitely more comfortable lying or sitting than standing. It is
of note that she had had her Beta blocker , Pendalol decreased from
5 mg to 2.5 mg prior to this trip to Glension Street On return to the
Gene Er Za , she had upper respiratory and pharyngeal symptoms
with low grade fevers and a cough productive of a green sputum.
This was treated with Amoxicillin given to her by her son who is a
pharmacist. These symptoms gradually resolved and she saw Dr.
Jessie on March , 1997 and was given a clean bill of health.
At this visit , he did start her on Prinivil. Since she had been
home from Er Dr. , Win Ca S , she really had not had repeat episodes of
diaphoresis. Then on the day of admission when she went shopping
and had a recurrent episode of diaphoresis while carrying bags ,
this time with substernal chest pain that radiated down both arms.
She also had a general sense of heaviness across her chest. She
drove home and took a sublingual nitroglycerin that completely
resolved her pain. She describes this pain as exactly like the
anginal pain that she had prior to her coronary artery bypass
graft. The total duration of this episode was approximately ten
minutes. By the time she presented to the Emergency Room , she had
no diaphoresis and no chest pain and was feeling perfectly normal.
The latest echocardiogram in April of 1997 showed an ejection
fraction of 35% with mid to distal septal and apical akinesis and
inferior akinesis with mild mitral regurgitation. In July of
1997 , she went 4 minutes and 18 seconds on an exercise tolerance
test with Thallium which showed only fixed defects , no reversible
defects.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease and
coronary artery bypass graft with cardiac
risk factors of hypertension , family history and high cholesterol ,
hypothyroidism and remote peptic ulcer disease with history of
cholecystectomy and appendectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Zocor 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. 2 ) Prinivil
5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Pendalol 2.5 mg
p.o. q. day. 4 ) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) Synthroid 0.100
mg p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday and Friday and 0.12 mg p.o. Tuesday ,
Thursday , Saturday and Sunday. 6 ) Pepcid p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in Full Quer Dienson with her husband and
has two married sons. She does not smoke and
drinks wine occasionally.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of a myocardial infarction at age 58
and her brother had a coronary artery bypass graft
at age 79 and she has a sister with Alzheimer's disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , elderly woman in
no apparent distress. Vital signs:
Temperature 99.4 degrees , heart rate 87 , blood pressure 115/78 ,
respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The rest
of the physical examination was significant for a clear oropharynx.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular
examination was regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 and a two out of
six systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border with
no gallop or rub. Abdomen was soft with good bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no edema. Neurological examination was
non-focal. Rectal examination was guaiac negative with no masses.
LABORATORY: Laboratory studies were significant for a white blood
cell count of 5.46 , hematocrit 40.1 , platelets 190.
Cardiac Troponin I was 0.0. CK was 102. Urinalysis was negative.
Chest x-ray was clear with no infiltrates. EKG was normal sinus
rhythm with normal intervals and normal axis with a left bundle
branch block pattern and first degree atrioventricular block with
no change compared to an EKG done on March , 1997.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The impression on admission was that this is a
woman with known coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass graft who is now experiencing unstable
angina with diaphoretic episodes , both at rest and exertion and now
substernal chest pain. She ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
On April , 1998 , she had a standard Bruce exercise tolerance
test in which she went 3 minutes , 30 seconds and stopped because of
chest pain. This was typical of anginal pain and resolved eight
minutes into recovery. The EKG had no changes with a left bundle
branch block at baseline and this was considered to be consistent
with but not diagnostic of ischemia. She subsequently underwent
cardiac catheterization which revealed patent grafts with her known
underlying native disease. Her right atrial pressure was 4 , right
ventricular 46/8 , PA 42/22 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 19.
From here , she was managed medically with increases in her ACE
inhibitor , Statin and the addition of nitrates. After the cardiac
catheterization , she developed a large right groin hematoma at the
puncture site and a bruit was noted. An ultrasound was done that
revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the common femoral artery. She was
followed by Vascular Surgery and on May , 1998 , had a
follow-up ultrasound which confirmed the presence of a
pseudoaneurysm in her common femoral artery measuring 2 X 1.5 cm
surrounded by a large hematoma. On May , 1998 , the patient
underwent surgical repair of the pseudoaneurysm without any
complications and she was discharged on March , 1998 with
follow-up with both Dr. Polito of Vascular Surgery and Dr. Khat ,
her cardiologist.

which also wakes her from sleep. She often opens the window ,
turns on the air conditioning , etc. when she feels short of
breath. She started sleeping on two pillows over the past few
weeks. She also reports an intermittent increase in her leg
swelling and a cough productive of scant clear to whitish sputum.
She was unable to name her home medications , but stated that she
took four medications plus insulin which is in accordance with
her LMR notes. She has not been able to check her fingerstick
blood glucose levels recently because her machine has been
broken. She denies chest pain , tightness except with coughing.
She denies pleuritic pain , any recent illness , any sick contacts ,
any change in urinary or bowel habits , any nausea or vomiting ,
night sweats , diaphoresis or pain in her jaw or arms. Of note ,
her GIES HEALTH primary care physician , Dr. Miquel Crayford , note from
September 2004 noted tachycardia greater than 100 with decreased
exercise tolerance , inability to lie flat , and snoring and
daytime sleepiness. At this time , an echocardiogram performed in
January 2004 revealed an EF of 60 to 65% , trace PR and no regional
wall motion abnormality.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension. Bilateral
DVTs in 1972. The patient is not currently on anticoagulation.
She was on Coumadin for one year following this event.
Dysfunctional vaginal bleeding. Fibroids. Type II diabetes
mellitus. Morbid obesity. Pituitary microadenoma.
HOME MEDICATIONS: ( Per LMR - the patient confirms these as best
she can recollect ).
1. HCTZ 25 mg daily.
2. Glucophage 500 mg PO b.i.d.
3. NPH insulin 60 q.a.m. , 20 q.p.m.
4. Lisinopril 40 mg.
5. Iron supplements.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies tobacco use , alcohol use ,
drugs. She lives with her daughter who is one of her four
children , and eight of her 14 grandchildren in Otteba
She does not work.
FAMILY HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes mellitus. No known MI's.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.8. Heart rate
137 , down to 98 with 5 mg of IV Lopressor in the Emergency
Department. Blood pressure 156/98 , satting 95% on room air. In
general , the patient is an obese , pleasant woman in no apparent
distress. HEENT: Extraocular muscles are intact. Mucous
membranes moist. No JVD. Cardiovascular exam reveals
tachycardia , S1 , S2. No murmurs , rubs or gallops but heart
sounds are distant and difficult to assess. Lungs: Decreased
breath sounds throughout secondary to body habitus , but no
crackles or wheeze noted. Abdomen: Soft , nontender ,
nondistended. Extremities warm and well perfused. Bilateral
pitting edema to shins. Derm: No ulcers or lesions.
Hyperpigmentation noted around neck and under breasts. GU exam:
Very trace guaiac positive stool.
ADMISSION LABORATORY RESULTS: Notable for a blood glucose of
190 , BNP of 271 , and hematocrit of 32. ??_____?? EKG: Sinus
tachycardia at 118 with no ST or T-wave abnormalities. Chest
x-ray revealed mild cardiomegaly. No pulmonary edema. No
infiltrate. PE protocol CT ruled out central PE and showed a
small right pleural effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient had cycled electrocardiograms and
biomarkers. These were negative for myocardial ischemia or any
acute change. The patient was maintained on aspirin , Lipitor 80
mg , beta-blocker , and ACE inhibitor. The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization on 8/10/05 which revealed a 50% LAD
lesion , a 70% D1 lesion. These lesions were not intervened upon
at the time of dictation. This patient is awaiting viability
study.
Pump: The patient underwent echocardiography on 5/19/05. The
findings of that study were very concerning revealing ejection
fraction of 20 to 25% , sharply decreased from EF of 60 to 65% in
January 2004. In addition , the study revealed global hypokinesis
with septal akinesis.
Rhythm: The patient has remained tachycardic and has been
monitored on tele with no noted abnormalities. On the night of
8/10/05 following cardiac catheterization , the patient had a 13
beat run of nonsustained V. tach on telemetry. She received
electrolyte optimization and close monitoring. Following this
episode , the patient's cycled cardiac biomarkers revealed a
troponin of 7.25 , MB fraction of 31 , CK of 283. As noted above ,
she will undergo cardiac viability study on 4/30/05 and may
receive evaluation by the Electrophysiology Service.
2. Pulmonary: The patient's initial presentation was suspicious
for pulmonary embolism given her distant past medical history of
DVT's. However , when she was admitted , she exhibited only
tachycardia without evidence of tachypnea or hypoxia and her
clinical course thus far , as well as her PE protocol CT is not
suggestive of this diagnosis. She has had a minimal oxygen
requirement over the course of her hospital stay. She does
experience dyspnea on exertion , however , has not been hypoxic at
any point.
3. Endocrine: TSH was normal. The patient was continued on her
oral hypoglycemic as well as an adjusted insulin regimen which
will be further altered prior to the patient's discharge. In
addition , she will be discharged with a prescription for a new
blood glucose monitor. Her last hemoglobin A1c check was close
to 12. Given her concerning findings of coronary artery disease ,
she will need to maintain much tighter control of her blood
glucose in the future. At the time of dictation , the patient is
being maintained on scheduled NPH as well as regular insulin
sliding scale.
4. Hematologic: Baseline anemia with admission hematocrit
improved from prior infectious diseases. The patient's
productive cough was thought to be not due to infection. The
patient has remained afebrile with normal white blood cell count
over the course of her hospital stay.
The remainder of this patient's hospital course and her discharge
medications will be dictated in a future addendum.

Discharge Date: 10/15/2005
ATTENDING: WUITSCHICK , LEROY M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Heart failure.
LISTS OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES: Status post cardiac transplant
in 1993 , obesity , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , chronic renal insufficiency
with a baseline of creatinine of 1.5 , hepatitis B , hypertension ,
osteoporosis , status post L3 compression fracture , status post
left hip fracture with replacement in September 2005 , complicated by
infection necessitating removal , debridement , and deconditioning.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Halnon is a 67-year-old
female with multiple medical comorbidities and a past medical
history significant for cardiac transplant in 1993 , and hip
replacement in September 2005 , complicated by wound infection , and need
for prolonged rehabilitation who presented from Port Medical Center to Ephma Mersources Ni Memorial Hospital with three days of
progressive worsening shortness of breath. Her chest x-ray was
consistent with congestive heart failure , and she was transferred
to Ckmond Kinga Quinaualv Medical Center with the request of her daughter
for further management of her heart failure. Here , her mental
status was borderline upon admission , but it improved with
discontinuation of standing analgesic and decreasing of her
clonazepam. A head CT showed no acute processes. She had a
right upper arm cellulitis and urinary tract infection on
screening urinalysis. She was anemic. She was found to be
vancomycin resistant Enterococcus positive , but repeated cultures
demonstrated MRSA negative. Her inpatient issues included
management of her heart failure , right upper extremity
cellulitis , urinary tract infection , chronic anemia , diabetes ,
and evaluation of her hip by orthopedics.
ALLERGIES: She had allergies to penicillin and codeine , but the
reactions are unknown.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Vitamin C , Imuran , PhosLo , iron
sulfate , Deltasone , Coumadin , Aranesp , Dilaudid for pain ,
lactulose , Reglan , Sarna topical , Senokot , Ambien for sleep ,
miconazole powder , cyclosporine , Celexa , and Lasix 80 mg once per
day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile. Her blood pressure was
130/57 , and her pulse 120 in sinus tachycardia. She was 95%
saturated on 3 liters. Physical exam was significant for
bibasilar crackles in her lungs. 2+ edema in her legs to her
knees. A 5 cm x 5 cm area of warm erythema in her right upper
extremity and a left hip wound with packing in place granulation
tissue.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: CT of her head , which showed no acute
processes. Echocardiogram of her heart showed an ejection
fraction of 55%. Normal right ventricle and structure with mild
to moderately reduced systolic function in her right ventricle.
Moderately dilated left atrium , moderately dilated right atrium ,
normal aortic valve , mild to moderate mitral regurgitation , and
structurally normal tricuspid valve. Right upper arm ultrasound ,
which showed no evidence of venous obstruction.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: Ms. Gockley 's inpatient issues
included management of her heart failure , right upper arm
extremity cellulitis , urinary tract infection , chronic anemia ,
diabetes and evaluation of her hip by orthopedics. For her heart
failure , she was diuresed with IV and transitioned to oral
torsemide and they entered discharge dose of torsemide 200 mg
p.o. twice per day. Her admission weight was 133 kg and her
discharge weight 122 kg. She should continue on her current
torsemide and limit her daily salt intake , and restrict herself
to 2 liters per day for her right upper extremity cellulitis.
She was given a five-day course of levofloxacin ( used to address
recurrent UTI ) and then a two-day course of Ancef , her cellulitis
cleared with this regimen. For her urinary tract infection , she
was initially treated with levofloxacin and transitioned to
Bactrim based on antibiogram sensitivities. A long-term Foley
catheter was removed. Repeat cultures showed bacteria in her
urine; however , she was clinically asymptomatic , it was felt that
this is more consistent with colonization and no further
treatment was instituted. If needed for further antibiotics , a
PICC line was placed on May , 2005 , after her prior PICC
line clotted. Prior to discharge , a new Foley catheter was
placed and she was incontinent of urine and overall more
comfortable with catheter in place. While on Bactrim for her
UTI , her creatinine rose to a peak of 2.0 , it was unclear whether
this raise was due to diuresis or the antibiotic. With cessation
of the antibiotic , her creatinine trended downward to her
baseline at 1.6. For her chronic anemia , the patient was
continued on iron ( which was increased to three times per day )
and darbepoetin , folate was added. She was asymptomatic from her
chronic anemia. She was given two units of packed red blood
cells in May , 2005 , and two more units on February ,
2005 , and she responded appropriately to this. Her discharge
hematocrit was 30. Her hip was evaluated by orthopedics. They
felt her hip was healing well. She should be continued on
wet-to-dry dressings. No further orthopedic intervention is
planned. She can bear her full weight on her hip. At discharge ,
the patient was hemodynamically stable , afebrile , and breathing
comfortably on three liters of oxygen. She was discharged to
Naor Viewmor Hospital and should work aggressively towards
reconditioning.

Discharge Date: 7/28/1992
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: APPENDICITIS.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: GRAVES' DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 35-year-old woman
with a history of Graves' disease and
known cholelithiasis who presented to the Leadreid Hospital Emergency Room with a 12 hour history of increasing right
upper quadrant and right lower quadrant abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting and a fever. She had one normal bowel movement on the day
of admission. She denied pyuria , anorexia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Graves' disease. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None. MEDICATIONS: On
admission included , 10 mg po b.i.d.; Inderal , 40 mg po
b.i.d. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. HABITS: Negative
smoking history. No alcohol intake.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed an ill appearing
female in moderate distress. Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac exam revealed a regular
rate and rhythm. Abdomen was soft , nondistended , right lower
quadrant and right upper quadrant tenderness , lower greater than
upper , positive bowel sounds , negative Murphy's sign. No shake or
peritoneal signs. Rectal exam revealed normal tone , no masses ,
nontender , no stool in vault.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a white blood cell
count of 14.33. Hematocrit 36.3. Urinalysis
revealed 15-20 red cells.
PROCEDURES: EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY.
APPENDECTOMY.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor. There ,
she had a temperature of 102.2 and a pulse of
152. She continued to experience right upper and right lower
quadrant pain , lower greater than upper. Because of a known
cholelithiasis , differential of her right sided abdominal pain
included , primarily , cholecystitis and appendicitis. She thus
underwent abdominal ultrasound. Ultrasound revealed right upper
quadrant gallbladder with mildly thickened walls , gallstones , but
no common duct dilatation or pericholecystic fluid. The right
lower quadrant revealed thickened small bowel walls but peristalsis
was also identifiable. Using the ultrasound probe , the right lower
quadrant was certainly more tender than the right upper quadrant.
On serial examinations , her abdominal pain and tenderness became
gradually worse and her temperature continued to remain high
spiking to 101 to 102. She was thus brought to the Operating Room
for an exploratory laparotomy. A paramedian incision was made and
appendicitis noted. The gallbladder appeared grossly normal. She
tolerated the procedure well without any complications.
Postoperatively , she continued to have high temperature spiking
over 103 degrees. She also became tachycardic to approximately
150. Because she had not been taking her medications for a few
days preoperatively as well as because she had tremor ,
hyperreflexia , fever , and tachycardia she was suspected to be
thyrotoxic. Of note , she had been in atrial fibrillation one month
prior to admission. Endocrinology consult was obtained and based
on their recommendations , she was restarted on , 15 mg po q
six hours; Inderal , 40 mg po q six hours; SSKI , one-third of 1 cc
po t.i.d. Thyroid function tests were sent. She gradually
defervesced. Her heart rate diminished and her ambulation was
rapidly advanced. Her wound was noted to be slightly erythematous
and she was thus started on Velosef.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: On discharge included Percocet , one
to two tablets po q four hours p.r.n.; Inderal , 40 mg
po q six hours; SSKI , one-third cc po t.i.d.; , 10 mg po
t.i.d.; Velosef , 500 mg po q.i.d. times seven days.

Discharge Date: 2/29/1994
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS: HYPOTENSIVE EPISODE.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. End stage renal disease on chronic
hemodialysis. 2. Mild mental retardation.
3. Movement disorder ( tics ). 4. Status post parathyroidectomy.
5. Partial thyroidectomy. 6. Status post partial gastrectomy for
peptic ulcer disease. 7. History of MRSA from wound in 1988.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46-year-old
gentleman with end stage renal disease
on chronic hemodialysis who was admitted status post fall and
seizure. The patient's end stage renal disease is thought to be
secondary to hypertension , although he has never had a renal
biopsy. He has been on hemodialysis since 1987 , having dialysis
three times a week. His dry weight is about 85 to 86 kilos. His
dialysis has been complicated by multiple episodes in the past of
hypotension and seizure activity occurring after dialysis. These
episodes occur about once a month.
On the day of admission , the patient came home from routine
hemodialysis where he was ultrafiltered 5.5 kilograms of fluid and
his final blood pressure after dialysis was 100/60. At noon , the
patient went home , ate lunch and went up to his room. At that time
he complained of feeling dizzy and sitting on the edge of the bed
told his uncle that he was not feeling well and then slumped onto
the floor. He does not believe that he hurt himself , i.e. , did not
hurt his head , although he did complain of some right foot pain.
He was still conscious as his uncle lifted him back to bed and then
an ambulance was called.
After a few minutes , the patient lost consciousness , rolling his
eyes back with some facial twitching bilaterally and tongue
retraction. This episode lasted about five minutes. There was no
tongue biting , no urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence. The
patient gained full recovery of his alertness upon waking up but
was a bit diaphoretic. His aunt checked his vital signs which were
blood pressure 70/40 , pulse 79. The patient had also complained of
chest pain for a few minutes prior to his episode. When the EMTs
arrived , the patient was alert and oriented times three , cold and
clammy , temperature 98.6 , pulse 89 , respirations 26 , blood pressure
82/60.
The patient was brought to the emergency room and was orthostatic
by blood pressure ( 10 points ) from lying to sitting. He was given
500 ccs of normal saline and was no longer orthostatic , comfortably
sitting up in the bed. At about 9:00 p.m. he complained of feeling
dizzy and became diaphoretic while trying to stand up. The patient
was again brought into bed. He became unresponsive for one minute
with his eyes rolled up and some bilateral face twitching. This
episode only lasted about one minute. The patient was admitted for
observation.
Past medical history reveals the following: 1 ) Mild mental
retardation since about 10 years ago. 2 ) Movement disorder ( tics )
on Stelazine. 3 ) End stage renal disease thought to be secondary
to hypertension. 4 ) Status post parathyroidectomy for secondary
hyperparathyroidism. 5 ) Partial thyroidectomy for goiter
incidentally found at surgery. 6 ) Status post partial gastrectomy
for peptic ulcer disease in the 1960's. 7 ) History of MRSA from
wound in 1988. 8 ) Hepatitis B surface antibody positive and
hepatitis C virus positive. Medications on admission: Calcium
carbonate , 1250 mg PO tid; nephrocaps , 1 PO qd; DHT , 0.2 mg PO qd;
Stelazine , 2 mg PO tid. There are no known allergies. Social
history: The patient was a former smoker and has a history of
alcohol abuse but no IV drug use. He lives with his aunt and uncle
and is mildly retarded.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , vital signs
showed a lying blood pressure of 96/60 ,
pulse 80 , sitting up blood pressure 104/70 , pulse 96 , temperature
97.5 , O2 sat 95% on room air. The patient was a well nourished ,
black male in no apparent distress. HEENT exam was unremarkable.
Neck showed JVD of 4 cms. No lymphadenopathy. Chest was clear to
auscultation. Heart revealed S1 , S2 , normal rate and rhythm with a
1/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border.
No CVA tenderness. Abdomen was soft , nontender , no masses. Bowel
sounds were positive. The patient was guaiac negative with brown
stool. Extremities revealed a tender , edematous dorsal aspect of
right foot , with full range of motion at the ankle joint. Left
extremity benign. Neuro exam was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , sodium 142 , potassium 4.8 ,
chloride 94 , bicarb 32 , BUN 38 , creatinine 8.6 ,
glucose 168. A CBC revealed white count of 8.82 , hematocrit 35 ,
platelets 246. Calcium was 9.7. Chest x-ray revealed mild
pulmonary vascular redistribution with no significant CHF and no
infiltrates. Ankle x-rays on the right revealed no fracture or
dislocation. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 76 ,
axis 2 degrees , some 1 mm ST elevations in I and AVL , T-waves flat
in lead III. The slight elevations in ST were consistent with EKG
on 1/9/94.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was observed overnight and put on
an oral renal diet , checking orthostatics
frequently. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout his
hospital course and remained hemodynamically stable with no
orthostasis. The patient was evaluated by the renal service who
assessed that this episode was most likely secondary to the
extensive fluid removal from dialysis leading to a low blood
pressure. In addition , they noted that seizures and orthostasis
are often seen status post dialysis in some patients. They
recommended no further work up of this seizure episode and
recommended no prophylaxis with an antiepileptic. The patient
underwent dialysis again on 6/5/94 per schedule. After this
dialysis , the patient was asymptomatic , not orthostatic and did not
complain of any light headedness.
As the patient complained of right foot pain , right foot films were
obtained which revealed nondisplaced fractures of the second ,
third , fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. Orthopaedic service was
consulted who put the patient in a bivalve cast with a toe plate.
Physical therapy was consulted. The patient was allowed to sit in
a chair and engage in nonweight bearing activities. His foot was
elevated on three pillows for 72 hours. The patient remained
hemodynamically stable and now awaits placement into a skilled
nursing facility for rehabilitation , given his casted right lower
leg.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged on his medications
from admission which include: 1 ) Nephrocaps , 1 PO
qd. 2 ) Calcium carbonate , 1250 mg PO tid. 3 ) DHT , 0.2 mg PO qd.
4 ) Stelazine , 2 mg PO tid. The patient will be seen again in
orthopaedics clinic on Friday , 5/13/94 at 9:15 a.m. The patient is
discharged in stable condition to a rehab/skilled nursing facility
per wishes of patient , family and per recommendation of physical
therapy.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: 59F w/ CAD recently RCA/OM1 stent admitted with
nephrolithiasis for pain control. HPI: hx chronic pain syndrome on
percocet and morphine ( also for OA ) , who recently had R heart
cath and PCI 1 wks ago. During that admission , was noted to have
hematuria --> renal f/u. C/O L flank pain x 2 days , planned for CT.
In Cards clinic on DOA , noted poor pain control. admitted by ED for
pain control. Got ASA , no IVF. morphine. PMH: chronic pain syndrome ,

EVENTS: in ED OBS appeared comfortable on dilaudid and
morphine. ----------
STATUS: resumed on home pain regimen , required additional 25 mg oxycodone
overnight.
--------- STUDIES:
I- CT showed: kidney stones on R , by CT ureter in ED , no hydro.
stones are old , not clear that this is causing her current pain.
-------- IMP: 59F with CAD and recent PCI now with
nephrolithiasis and pain control problems. PLAN:
1. CV: gave lasix to increase filtration and UOP , while
increasing IVF to keep up w/ euvolemic state.
- cont outpt regimen - asa , statin , bb , acei. 2. GU/RENAL: increase
UOP w/ IVF and Lasix. 3. ID: does not appear to have systemic
infection. Inflammation of ureter. tx UTI ( UA+ ) with cipro 250 mg PO x 7
days. Started 4/23 , ending 3/6
4. FEN: Diabetic , low salt , low fat/cholesterol diet 5. Pain control with
home regimen of MScontin and
oxycodone. Switched to 45 mg oxycontin PO q12h instead of MS contin upon
discharge as patient requiring frequent PRN for breakthrough. Of note ,
back pain crosses lumbosacrum , radiates down legs bilaterally , and to
groin bilaterally. This distribution is consistent with a
more mucskuloskeletal etiology of pain , rather than R-sided
nephrolithiasis.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You must continue your medications , especially aspirin and plavix to
protect your stent. Continue the Ciprrfloxacin for your UTI. Follow up
with your doctors or call to reschedule the appointments. Call your
doctor or return to the ER if you have fever , chills , sweats , worsening
shortness of breath , chest pain , or any other problems.

Discharge Date: 2/13/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: LEGIONELLA PNEUMONIA , BILATERAL PLEURAL
EFFUSIONS.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57-year-old
female with a distant history of
ovarian cancer , rheumatoid arthritis with systemic lupus
erythematosus features , and history of TTP , status post
splenectomy , who was admitted with fever , shortness of breath and
pleuritic chest pain. She was in her usual state of health until
October of this year , when she began to experience dyspnea on
exertion , shortness of breath one week after her husband died.
Initially she thought it was anxiety secondary to her husband's
death , but this shortness of breath began to increase and occurred
on rest. She also reports that she has had a recent history of
orthopnea and says that for the past few months she has had
bilateral lower extremity edema with gradual onset. She also has
had a dry , non productive cough for the past month and three days
ago began to have fevers up to 102 , chills , nausea , dry heaves ,
headache and diarrhea. The shortness of breath has increased in
intensity and yesterday she began to experience sharp pleuritic
right chest pain. She denied productive cough , neck stiffness ,
photophobia , sick contacts , chest pain , palpitations , or recent
travel. Of note , the patient had been on Plaquenil previously but
she self discontinued this three months ago because she has been
feeling well. She has had no recurrence of her rheumatoid
arthritis symptoms , which for her include arthritis in her hands.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is significant for
diabetes type 2 , hypertension , TTP , history
of splenectomy , history of Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal
sepsis , rheumatoid arthritis with systemic lupus erythematosus
features , history of osteomyelitis in the right ankle , history of
ovarian cancer in 1989 , status post chemotherapy , total abdominal
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications include diltiazem 240 mg a day ,
lisinopril 40 mg a day , Naprosyn 500 mg b.i.d. , NPH
insulin 24 units subcutaneously q.a.m. , Entex-LA.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her son. Her husband recently
died in October of this year with esophageal
cancer. She has no alcohol or tobacco use. She is an elementary
school teacher.
FAMILY HISTORY: Family history is significant for coronary artery
disease as well as breast carcinoma.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , the patient was
afebrile with a temperature of 98 , pulse in
the 100s , blood pressure 182/99. The patient's oxygen saturation
was 92% on 5 liters. She was alert and oriented , in mild
respiratory distress. The skin was without rash. HEENT: Not
significant. NECK: The neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly. CARDIOVASCULAR: Tachycardic , regular rhythm , without
murmurs , gallops or rubs. She had no jugular venous distention.
LUNGS: The lungs revealed markedly decreased breath sounds at the
bases and faint crackles at the bases on the right. ABDOMEN:
Abdominal examination was completely benign. No hepatomegaly or
masses. She did have a scar from the splenectomy. EXTREMITIES:
The extremities showed 1+ edema bilaterally. There were no cords.
Negative Homans' sign. There was no clubbing or cyanosis.
NEUROLOGICAL: The neurological examination was intact.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant laboratory studies included a
sodium of 137 , white blood cell count of 19.5
with 2 bands and 86 polys as well as Howell-Jolly bodies.
Hematocrit was 38.6 , platelets 495 , 000. CK was 50 , troponin was 0.
D-dimer was greater than 1 , 000. Chest x-ray revealed large
bilateral pleural effusions , left greater than right. She had a CT
scan which was a limited study that showed no evidence of a
pulmonary embolism. It showed a questionable infiltrate in the
right lung versus compressive atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 57-year-old female with a
distant history of ovarian cancer and TTP , who
was admitted with likely community acquired pneumonia and bilateral
moderate to large pleural effusions. Initially the patient was
given cefuroxime and levofloxacin in the emergency department for a
presumed community acquired pneumonia. She also was given Lasix
for diuresis , given there was a question of whether or not she was
having any heart failure. Given her elevated D-dimer , she had a
spiral CT scan of the chest which did not reveal any evidence of
pulmonary embolus and also had lower extremity Dopplers which were
negative. However , there was a continuous Doppler wave form on the
study which raised the suspicion of a more proximal venous
compression. Therefore , she underwent abdominal CT scan , which did
not show any evidence of venous obstruction as well as lymphatic
obstruction.
1 ) INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient was admitted and treated for
what was thought to initially be just a community acquired
pneumonia with large effusions , likely peripneumonic in nature.
She initially was started on cefuroxime and azithromycin by the
General Medicine team. She was pancultured as well as had
Legionella urine antigen sent. Subsequently her Legionella urine
antigen became positive and repeat test again revealed that this
was in fact positive. At that time , levofloxacin was added given
recommendations from the Infectious Disease Service. She was
continued on azithromycin; however , cefuroxime was discontinued as
there was no evidence of other etiology of her pneumonia. She
underwent thoracentesis late the evening of her admission , which
revealed a transudate. Cytology was sent on this and was negative
as well as all cultures were negative from this. She underwent
multiple bilateral therapeutic pleuracentesis , given that the
effusions were quite large. Ultrasound revealed multiple
loculations on the right side and she had to undergo right sided
ultrasound guided thoracentesis to remove fluid. In addition , the
patient was aggressively diuresed with Lasix to help with the
effusions.
The patient continued to have a high oxygen requirement throughout
the hospitalization despite aggressive thoracentesis. However , as
she was diuresed aggressively , her oxygen requirement was down from
initially 5 to 6 liters per nasal cannula. Prior to discharge , she
was off of O2 except that she had desaturations to 86% with
ambulation. Therefore , she was discharged home with p.r.n. oxygen.
She remained afebrile throughout the rest of the hospitalization
and her pulmonary status continued to improve prior to discharge.
Other complications during the hospitalization included an elevated
platelet count up to 800. This was thought likely to be acute
phase reactant secondary to infection and fever and this will be
followed as an outpatient. In addition to this , she had an
elevated CA-125 level. This was discussed with her GYN oncologist
and he felt that this was likely from the effusions , but again
should be followed as an outpatient to make sure that this resolves
as the effusions continue to resolve. Abdominal CT scan , which was
done to rule out more proximal venous compression did not reveal
any recurrence of ovarian cancer.
The patient was discharged to home on October , 2000 , with services
as well as p.r.n. oxygen. She was in stable condition. She had no
problems with her diabetes , hypertension , rheumatoid arthritis
throughout the rest of her hospitalization.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her discharge medications include Lasix
80 mg b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale ,
lisinopril 40 mg a day , levofloxacin 500 mg times 14 days ,
Cardizem-CD 240 mg p.o. q.d.
FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow-up with Dr. Michalek in one week and
she is to have her platelets checked as well as a
CA-125 as her Legionella pneumonia resolves.

Discharge Date: 1/20/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
PROBLEMS DURING ADMISSION: 1 ) MIGRAINE HEADACHE.
2 ) NONSPECIFIC ABDOMINAL PAIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 35 year old female
who carries a diagnosis of lupus for
seven years , recently discharged with a pulmonary embolism and deep
vein thrombosis , on Coumadin and Lovenox , now returns with a
complaint of new onset chest pain and sob. Previously the patient has been
stable with her SLE but had started Plaquenil recently. On
9/28/99 she presented to her rheumatologist complaining of
intermittent leg swelling for the past year and was found to have
left superficial femoral and gastrocnemius DVT. She was about to
begin Lovenox when she mentioned that she had also experienced
occasional pleuritic chest pain over the last five years. She then had a V/Q
scan which was read as intermediate probability for PE. For definitive
diagnosis , a pulmonary angiogram was done on 2/28/99 showing bilateral apical
small pulmonary emboli.She was treated with IV heparin and was started on
Coumadin to a therapeutic INR of 2.0. She also had an unremarkable
echocardiogram at that time. On 2/30/99 , the patient returned
with increasing wheezing and shortness of breath. Her INR was 1.8.
Work up revealed an intermediate probability right-sided V/Q
mismatch with a probable new PE. Repeat echocardiogram showed no right
heart strain. It was thought that she had had a recurrent PE in
the setting of subtherapeutic INR. LE DVT was stable on the LENIs.
She was discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin to obtain a goal INR of
3.0. Unfortunately , two days prior to admission , the patient again
noted increased dyspnea on exertion. She has otherwise been
active , feeling well over the past week. She denies chest pain ,
leg pain , wheezing. V/Q scan performed on the morning of admission
showed new mismatched lesions at the left posterior base and right
anterior base. She notes stomach upset for the previous four days ,
recently had an upper GI work up , including an EGD which was
negative by patient's report. She denies any melena , nausea ,
vomiting , BRPPR. She has been tolerating p.o.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) SLE x 7 years , on Plaquenil recently.
2 ) Migraine headaches. 3 ) History of DVT.
4 ) Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 5 ) Status post
cesarean section.
ALLERGIES: Bactrim causing diarrhea , Ceftin causing diarrhea.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Tylenol p.r.n.; Plaquenil 200 mg q. d.;
Coumadin 7 mg p.o. q. d.; Lovenox for
the previous 6 days; Allegra; Albuterol MDI; Cipro; Heptadine.
FAMILY HISTORY: No history of clotting or bleeding disorders.
Her father died of leukemia. She has two sisters
with arthritis and one sister with ulcerative colitis.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has been married for 10 years and has
an eight-year-old daughter. She is an office
worker in Ver Albpids , Pennsylvania 98749 and has not worked for the past month. She
quit smoking on 9/28/99 at the time of her first admission. She
has 10-15 pack years and denies any history of alcohol or IVDU.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: An obese , pleasant , female in no acute
distress. Pulse 87. Blood pressure 118/50.
Saturation 97 percent on room air. Afebrile. HEENT: Oropharynx
is clear. Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly or
JVD. Lungs are clear to auscultation except scattered rales at the
right base. Heart normal S1 and S2. A II/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the left upper sternal border. Abdomen - large , obese ,
nontender , nondistended. Extremities - no palpable cords or edema.
Neurologic - alert and oriented , no focal deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 0.7 , WBC 105 , hematocrit 40 , platelets
307. Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at
86. Normal intervals and axis. No ST-T wave abnormalities.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient was
placed on intravenous heparin and the Lovenox and Coumadin were
discontinued in anticipation for an IVC filter placement the
following morning. She also received intravenous dihydroergotamine
for migraine headaches with good effect by the following morning.
The following morning , the patient received 2 units of FFP because
her INR was 3.0. The decision to place a filter was postponed and
instead a pulmonary angiogram was performed. This revealed no
obvious recurrent pulmonary embolism. The morning
of 10/27/99 , prior to the angiogram , two
events occurred. First event , the patient was walking to the
bathroom and her heart rate was noted to go at 140 beats per minute
and was approximately sinus tachycardia or supraventricular
tachycardia. This resolved after 45 seconds without intervention
and did not recur and there were no associated symptoms and the
patient was unaware of the event. The second event occurred about
one hour later and the patient noted approximately 5/10 sharp right
lower sternal border chest pain which was not pleuritic and not
positional and resolved spontaneously over the next 5 minutes and
did not recur. She also had some abdominal pain. She tolerated p.o.'s without
any gastrointestinal
symptoms throughout and the pain was mild with a benign abdominal
exam. This will be pursued by her outpatient physician , if

**CONSULTS: ACE , SS , nutrition
**Hospital Course:
CV/I: Patient was sucessfully ruled out by serial enzymes for a
potential myocardial infarction. The patient was continuedon his home ASA ,
statin , and BB during his hospital course. To rule out concern for ischemia
as a role in the deterioration of his cardiomyopathy , a left heart
catheterization was performed which showed worsening CAD from his prior
study 5 years. The patient has 3vd disease with diffuse lesions in his RT
PDA , RT LV-VR , LAD , Lcx. Given the patient's symptoms and echocardiographic
evidence of cardiomyopathy proceeded the progression of his CAD , it is
likely that his arteriosclerosis was not the primary etiology of his
imparied cardiac performance though may be contributing to his disease at
this time.
CV/P: CXR on admission revealed pulmonary edema. The patient had
an excellent reponse to diuresis on lasix and was weaned to room air on
the day after admission. His home blood pressure medications were
continued , and were well controlled. A right heart catheterization was
performed on 6/3 which showed elevated right and left sided filling
pressures , particularly with a Pcw of 24 and mean RA pressure of 5. The
patient was started on Imdur during this admission. His lisinopril was
continued.
Pt CV/R: Patient is undergoing evaulation for ICD. NO ectopy was noted
during full-time telemetric monitoring.
PULM: His OSA was treated with CPAP at 6 cm. No active asthma rx. No
wheezes on exam.
ENDO: Patient was maintained off his oral medications and placed on
insulin alone. On admission , his blood sugars were in the 300s. His Last
A1C was found to be 9.5. While following his blood sugars , his insulin was
titrated up and drug therapy discontinued. He was discharged with BID NPH
insulin to replace his previous med/insulin regimen. WSRH outpatient
diabetes services follow-up will be arranged for the patient.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. New stroke , right sided weakness and confusion.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
2. Myasthenia gravis.
3. Osteoarthritis.
4. Pernicious anemia.
5. Hypertension , degenerative joint disease.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right sided weakness and confusion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Benny is an 83 year old woman
with a history of myasthenia gravis ,
arthritis , pernicious anemia and hypertension and degenerative
joint disease with nerve impinging resulting in decreased reflexes
in the left lower extremity. She was in her usual state of health
until when she woke to go to the bathroom at approximately 2 a.m.
on the day of admission. She had difficulty getting up from the
sofa where she sleeps and slipped and fell to her knees. Because
she stated , ""her right leg was weak"". She started speaking and
talking loudly. Her son heard her , came up to help her. At the
time he arrived , she was crawling around on her hands and knees and
appeared to be mildly confused. He helped her up and assisted her
to the bathroom. She was able to walk with assistance and returned
to bed and did not feel like she needed to call a physician at that
time. She then awoke at approximately six in the morning and was
able to walk without assistance to wash her face and then to eat
breakfast. However , at breakfast , the son noted that she was using
her right hand clumsily cutting pieces of banana onto the floor ,
not adequately reaching her mouth to feed herself and had begun to
use her knife to eat her cereal. He discussed the problem with
her. She agreed that she probably needed to call a doctor about
this. She attempted to get out of the chair and again slipped
forward because of right leg weakness. She contacted her physician
who recommended that she be seen at the Troitcape Medical Center
When seen there , when leaving , her son noted that she seemed to run
into things on her right side. With entering the car , did not pick
up her right leg well. At the scboth community hospital , she was found to
have significant right hand weakness and proximal right leg
weakness. She was sent to the Ist Oska Rutl Memorial Health for further evaluation.
She denies having had any previous neurologic events similar to
this episode. She has had an episode of dizziness , nausea and
vomiting associated with a severe right occipital headache back in
8/5 at which time she was evaluated at the Hosch Reathertage Supro Grahot Clinic and was given
diagnosis of benign positional vertigo which since resolved. At
that time , she had a CT scan which showed only periventricular
white matter disease as well as an increased soft tissue density in
the region of the sella. An LP at that time revealed no white
cells and red cells which cleared with successive tubes. She also
six months ago was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis. At that time ,
she had the following symptoms: She had difficulty keeping her
neck up , difficulty swallowing , her eyelids were drooping. These
symptoms resolved quickly with Tensalon injection. She has been
since started on Mestinon and Prednisone with good relief and is
followed by Dr. Kaushiva at Ci Hospital for this problem
and was initially diagnosed by Dr. Gerbatz at Lametizens Health Services .
With regards to her current episode , she denies having any
symptoms of chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting and
palpitations. She has not had any febrile illness , nausea or
vomiting recently. She has not had any episodes of a shade coming
down before her eyes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Myasthenia gravis diagnosed by
Dr. Wilson Pozos at Hermum Medical Center
approximately six months ago. Symptoms as described above , good
relief with Mestinon and Prednisone. 2. Pernicious anemia ,
intrinsic factor antibody positive , receives monthly B12
injections. 3. Spine degenerative joint disease , LS spine CT in
1/11 showed most marked deterioration at the L4-L5 vertebra with
spondylolisthesis , bilateral foraminal narrowing and moderate
spinal stenosis. She has long standing decreased reflexes in her
left leg and some decreased sensation to light touch in her left
foot. 4. Hypertension , has taken Reserpine intermittently over the
last 25 years. She has tolerated this well apparently. This is an
outmoded medication however because she has been on it so long , it
has not been discontinued. However , she has been noted to suffer
from some mild depression. 5. Osteoarthritis affecting mostly the
hands and feet followed by Dr. Hiram Rodrigus at Toncamp Hospital 6. Long standing difficulty sleeping , takes
Phenobarbital 15 mg at night prn for this problem for the last 30
years 7. Frequent UTI's. 8. Episode of benign positional vertigo ,
8/5 as described above. 9. Status post hysterectomy , status post
ovariectomy. 10. Some difficulty with rightward gaze and upward
gaze of the right eye noted as long back as 4/7 11. Hemorrhoids.
12. Right kidney 15 mm simple cyst noted incidentally on the
abdominal CT.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Prednisone 12.5 mg q.o.d. , Daypro 600 mg

on the right are 4+/5 and on the left 5/5. Interossei on the right
5-/5 , on the left 5/5. Lower extremities: Iliopsoas , quads , hams
and gastrocs all 5/5 symmetric. EHL possibly slightly diminished
strength on the right. Has increased difficulty with heel to shin
on the right leg probably suggestive of proximal right lower
extremity weakness not apparent on cognition testing. Sensories
and light touch and pinprick are grossly intact throughout. No
double simultaneously stimulation extension , proprioception intact
in the feet bilaterally. Decreased vibration in the left foot
compared to the right foot , reflexes upper extremities 2+
symmetric , lower extremities - right lower extremity 3+ knee , 2+
ankle. Toes downgoing , left , 1+ knee , 1+ ankle , toe downgoing.
Coordination: Finger to nose within normal limits bilaterally.
Heel to shin slightly worse on the right lower extremity , possibly
secondary to proximal flexor weakness. Gait: Walks quickly but
requires holding onto assistants for balance. Incidentally , she
says it is because she needs shoes for arthritis , marked pronation
of the ankle on small steps.
LABS: Sodium 144 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 106 , C02 25 , BUN 15
and creatinine 0.9 , glucose 125 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium
2.0 , B12 was normal. RPR nonreactive. PFT's normal. Phenobarb
level not detected. Tox screen positive for Benzodiazepine ( this
may have been due to sedation she received for the CT. However , it
is not clear that she received sedation ). Hematocrit 34.6 with MCV
of 80.6 , platelets 217 , white count 9.05 , polys 73 , 18 lymphs , 7
monos , 2 eo and 7 basophils. PT 13.1 , PTT 25.7. CT:
Periventricular white matter disease , slightly increased density
above the sella.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is an elderly woman with hypertension ,
myasthenia gravis and arthritis who presented
with weakness of her right lower extremity and right hand and some
confusion as evidenced by using a knife to eat her cereal instead
of a spoon. Her exam was notable for mildly impaired attention ,
possibly confused clock difficulty with handwriting and decreased
strength of the right hand and likely probably decreased strength
to the right lower extremity. Hip flexors is based on the relative
difficulty with heel to shin on the right. Old findings on exam
included abnormalities of the right eye muscles , decreased left
palpebral fissure and sensory findings in the left lower
extremities as well as reflexes. Her presentation was consistent
with possible small vessel stroke affecting the arm and leg more
than the face. This could have occurred in the pons area or the
internal capsule. The component of confusion however is less
explainable based on a deep lesion such as this and raised the
possibility of a small cortical insult. MRI showed no territorial
stroke , just T2 intense abnormalities in the periventricular white
matter , corona radiata and centrum semiovalle suggestive of small
vessel disease. Echo and Holter were not suggestive of
cardioembolic disease. Echo showed normal LV size , preserved LV
function with estimated ejection fraction of 80%. There is also
mild LVH , no thrombus was seen. There was aortic sclerosis with
mildly regurgitation , mild thickening of the mitral valve leaflets
with mild mitral regurgitation and bubble study was negative.
Holter was sinus rhythm at 54 to 127 beats per minute. Occasional
frequent APB's , 14 atrial couplets , five runs of SVT ranging from 3
to 10 beats with heart rates 108 to 182 , occasionally only frequent
VPB's at all hours and one ventricular couplet. Carotid
noninvasive studies showed no significant hemodynamic lesions. Of
note on the MRI , the basilar artery appeared to be small caliber
and the carotid showed some calcification. On carotid noninvasive
studies , however , there was only minimal plaque in the carotid
arteries.
In summary , it appears that Ms. Epperly had a small vessel stroke.
She showed some critical improvement during hospital stay and was
able to walk without assistance on the second hospital day. She
also had improved right hand function and appeared to be less
confused. We recommended starting enteric coated aspirin which she
is to take one per day. In the setting of the acute stroke , we did
not control her blood pressure aggressively. Her pressures ranged
from systolics of 120 to 180 averaging around 140 to 150 with
diastolics usually in the 80's. We have suggested that she
discontinue the use of her Reserpine as intermittent use is
problematic especially with this medication and she admits to
intermittent use as well as the fact that she has suffered from
some mild depression that can be associated with Reserpine. She
will be started on an alternative blood pressure as an out-patient
with Dr. Scotton in the next week. We did not wish to start this
medication in the acute setting. She will likely be started on an
Ace inhibitor for blood pressure control. We also suggested that
she discontinue the use of Phenobarbital for sleep as this might
contribute to confusion.
Finally , since she is on Prednisone and Mestinon , we asked the
patient whether she was taking GI prophylaxis. Evidently , she only
does this intermittently as well. She may be on Carefate , however ,
we suggested taking an H2 blocker once in the evening and have
provided her with the prescription for Zantac 150 mg q h.s. She
will follow-up with Dr. Milosch , her primary doctor at Ni Health as well as Dr. Salmen at the Ont Hospital
for her myasthenia gravis and stroke. She has an appointment with
Dr. Zurovec next week on Wednesday.

Cardiology Broketroit Ma Ri
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Wetterauer is a 54-year-old female
with coronary artery disease status
post inferior myocardial infarction in October of 1997 , with sick
sinus syndrome , status post permanent pacemaker placement , and
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation controlled with amiodarone; also
with history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She was
admitted to the Crotamp Hospital for severe respiratory
distress on 7/10 The summary of clinical events is as follows.
The evening of 7/11 , the patient was having intercourse and
""collapsed."" She was very short of breath with this , and presented
to the Emergency Department via the paramedics. They attempted to
intubate her on the field and found her pulse oxygen to be about 60
percent on bag valve mask. They were unable to do so. She was
described during this episode by her husband as to have been
""gurgling."" She began to describe shortness of breath , and took
her inhalers which did not help. She began to cough quite a bit
and coughed up some frothy white sputum. At the Emergency
Department , she was immediately intubated at Sirose
There was some difficulty intubating her , and she was ultimately
intubated by the attending anesthesiologist there. An
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 25 to 30 percent with
flat CKs. She was diuresed six liters with a stable BUN and
creatinine and was extubated on 10/11 A right heart
catheterization there showed a pulmonary artery pressure of 40/15 ,
wedge of 12 , cardiac output of 5.2. Hemodymanics in the Intensive
Care Unit at Chebanks Hospital indicate the patient's cardiac output
was quite dependent on her SVR. Her cardiac index fell into the
high two's when her SVR was in the 1340 range , but jumped up into
the high three's at about 3.8 when her SVR was much lower down in
the 800s. At the outside hospital , a right upper lobe infiltrate
was also noted and she was given gentamicin 250 mg times one , and
clindamycin 600 mg. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and treated
with clindamycin , this caused resolution of her white count at the
outside hospital. She also had an increase in her Lasix and
lisinopril dose there , as well as her amiodarone. She was started
on Solu-Medrol 40 mg intravenous q.6 hours for possible asthma.
She did quite well after her treatment for pneumonia and treatment
for pulmonary edema , and was transferred to the Misutch University Hospital for further management.
Her last admission was on 2/7 to the Ceter Medical Center
for atypical chest pain , when she had a nondiagnostic exercise
tolerance test. She went 6 minutes and 19 seconds with a maximum
heart rate of 94. Her chest pain then was ultimately attributed to
a gastrointestinal cause.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post inferior
myocardial infarction on 4/27 She was last
admitted , as noted above , on 2/7 to the Lordchild Hospital for atypical
chest pain. The patient has sick sinus syndrome and is status post
dual chamber pacemaker in 6/19 Diabetes mellitus. Hypertension.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , well-controlled in the past on
amiodarone. Past rhythm monitoring has revealed brief runs of
ventricular tachycardia. Negative breast biopsy in 3/13
MEDICATIONS: Home medications include amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Prempro 0.625/2.5 p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Coumadin , nitroglycerin sublingual , Zantac , beclomethasone , and
Ventolin.
Medications on transfer , Lovenox 60 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 p.o.
q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , clindamycin 600 intravenous
q.8 , digoxin 0.25 , Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d. , Zantac , Albuterol ,
Flovent , Solu-Medrol , and amiodarone 300 mg once a day.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a ten pack year smoking history
and quit in 1968. No intravenous drug use. She
is retired from Medical Records at SGH . She has three grown
children and she is married.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission is
significant for a blood pressure of 114/93 ,
this is down from a very high blood pressure on admission at the
outside hospital which was in the 200s. Pulse is 60 , temperature
is 96.5 , saturating 97 percent on two liters. General , this is an
agitated woman in no acute distress. Her neck veins were about 5.0
to 6.0 cm of water. The lung examination showed a few crackles in
the left base with the right one clear. Cardiovascular examination
revealed a split S1 and normal S2 , also a soft S3 , the presence of
a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border
was noted. The abdomen was benign , no hepatosplenomegaly noted.
The extremities showed no edema , with intact distal pulses.
Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented times three with
no focal deficits , but careful neurologic examination was
impossible due to severe agitation and anxiety.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory on admission was significant for a
Troponin of 0.02 , CK of 80 , INR of 1.3 ,
hematocrit of 38.0 , BUN/creatinine of 24/0.6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Digerolamo was admitted to the Aley Coness-o Meoak Medical Center and managed by problems as follows.
Flash Pulmonary Edema: The initial concern for Mrs. Kozicki was of
this being an ischemic event causing her to have flash pulmonary
edema. However , coronary catheterization revealed the patient to
have clean coronaries. Echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular
hypertrophy with a low normal systolic function , with an ejection
fraction of 50 to 55 percent. There was akinesis of the inferior
wall present. She had normal right ventricular size and function.
She had 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation with mild left atrial
enlargement and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation with a regurgitive
velocity of about 2.7 meters per second consistent with minimal
pulmonary systolic pressures. Subsequently the patient was noted
to have had a history of hypothyroidism in the past , and she had
normal TSH recently checked by her primary care physician , Dr.
Slipper , of TCH . However , with no other etiology present , we
were worried about the patient having had tachyarrhythmia from some
other source causing this. The Electrophysiology Service
interrogated the patient's pacer which revealed a number of
tachyarrhythmias. A TSH panel was checked which revealed a TSH of
less than assay , and T4 free thyroxin index elevated. An
Endocrinology consultation was obtained , and they believed that the
patient's thyrotoxicosis was amiodarone induced. She was started
on Tapazole 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. They also suggested prednisone , but
the patient did refuse this. They recommended follow-up with
Endocrine in about four to six weeks. Therefore , the final
etiology for the patient's flash pulmonary edema was amiodarone
induced thyrotoxicosis causing increased susceptibility to
tachyarrhythmia , left ventricular hypertrophy , and possible
diastolic dysfunction , resulting in acute pump dysfunction , causing
flash pulmonary edema. The final therapy for this problem will
consist of heavy nodal blockade. The patient will be blockaded
with calcium channel blockers , as well as Lopressor.
Pneumonia: The patient was treated with clindamycin and did quite
well. Her white count fully resolved and she had no fever or other
symptoms of pneumonia. She will be discharged without any further
antibiotics.
Urinary Tract Infection: She had a lot of uric crystals , therefore
she was placed on Bactrim Double Strength b.i.d. times a total of
seven days.
Psychiatry: The patient has clearly severe anxiety and was in a
full panic attack on admission. She was treated acutely with
Ativan and her problem resolved quite well , and she became more
comfortable in the hospital.
Diabetes Mellitus: Glyburide was held initially on admission. She
was covered with insulin sliding scale. Glyburide was restarted on
the day of discharge. The patient was noted to have relatively
high blood sugars , and these should be followed as an outpatient.
Blood sugars as high as the mid 300s were noted.
Edema: The patient clearly had some fluid accumulation which
resolved with 20 mg of Lasix p.o. q.d. We will continue this and
allow outpatient follow-up to determine whether or not she will
need this in the future.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,
lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Tapazole 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 5.0
mg p.o. q.p.m. , Bactrim Double Strength one tablet p.o. b.i.d.
times four days after discharge , Prempro 0.625/2.5 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol 150 mg
p.o. q.d. , diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. q.d.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in good condition.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Thyrotoxicosis.
FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with Dr. Provins on Monday , 9/18
at 9:30 a.m. , and Dr. Orejel of Chia Memorial Hospital Endocrinology at U Hay Rill , on 7/16 at 3:00

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: INFECTION/RULE OUT ENDOCARDITIS.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1 ) STATUS POST STAPHYLOCOCCUS ENDOCARDITIS
IN March 1995.
2 ) STATUS POST AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT
TIMES THREE WITH ST. JUDE IN April 1995.
3 ) NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65 year old man with a
history of rheumatic heart disease
status post aortic valve replacement times three who suffered acute
bacterial endocarditis ( Staphylococcus aureus , not MRSA ) in 5/26
He presented with nausea , vomiting times one , ""a black out"" ,
weakness , and temperature of 101.2 the morning of admission. This
patient was admitted back on 10/5/95 with fever times five days ,
nasal congestion , and change in mental status. He was found in bed
with fecal incontinence and increased confusion at that time. Back
in October 1995 , the initial TE showed no vegetation. He was
treated with Cefotaxime and Vancomycin. Patient subsequently
developed atrial fibrillation with congestive heart failure and the
hypertension. On October , he was intubated at which time a TE
showed aortic vegetations. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus
aureus and the antibiotics were changed to Oxacillin and
Tobramycin. Patient underwent a high risk redo aortic valve
replacement with St. Jude mechanical valve because of persistent
sepsis. The antibiotics were narrowed to Oxacillin. Patient had a
number of septic embolic events and emboli were thrown to the brain
with a right MCA stroke and the spleen as well as the duodenum. On
2/30 , he had an elevated white count , increasing temperature , and
increasing renal failure. At that time , the CT showed these renal
and splenic abscesses and patient was taken to the Operating Room.
He underwent a splenectomy and was found to have a perforated
duodenal ulcer. He underwent vagotomy with pyeloplasty. The
spleen showed multiple abscesses which grew out Candida. On this
admission , the patient was in his usual state of good health until
one week prior to admission when he experienced fatigue. At
baseline , the patient experienced intermittent sharp chest pain
felt to be musculoskeletal secondary to open thoracic surgery.
Patient also experienced pins and needle feelings felt in both
hands. On the night prior to admission , the patient sneezed
experiencing increased back pain. Later that night , he awoke
diaphoretic with aches and pains in the legs. Patient was sick in
the stomach but believed he would feel better if he ate watermelon
whereupon finishing , he had nausea and vomiting times one. Patient
went back to bed and awoke with joint pain throughout with
temperature at 7 a.m. on 100.1 degrees. Later while sitting in a
chair trying to dress , he stood and things started ""to go black"".
He walked towards the bathroom , got weak , knew he was going down ,
avoided falling down the stairs , and landed on all fours on his
hands and knees. Patient denied head trauma and suffered no
injury. He had no loss of continence or seizure activity. Patient
got up and moved to the bathroom under his own power. He had a
small bowel movement and felt better. Wife returned home and
temperature at 9 a.m. was 101.2. Patient was taken to Ertj. Health Urgent Care Center. At CTACH , he received blood cultures times
two and blood tests before being brought to the Gra Forro Memorial Hospital Emergency Room. Patient denied any recent cough , sore
throat , dysuria , and hematuria but did note increased nasal
congestion and shortness of breath over the past month.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) History of rheumatic heart disease with
aortic valve replacement times three in
3/26 , 1981 , and 5/26 2 ) Acute Staphylococcus aureus bacterial
endocarditis with septic emboli to brain , kidney , and spleen in
6/8 3 ) Status post splenectomy and Candida cultured out. 4 )
Duodenal ulcer status post resection and gastrectomy with vagotomy.
5 ) Status post multiple cerebrovascular accidents. 6 ) Low back
pain. 7 ) Vertigo on Meclizine. 8 ) Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
9 ) Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 10 ) Paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Beclovent and Ventolin puffers , Lopressor 25
mg b.i.d. , Glyburide 2.5 mg q.d. , Hytrin 5 mg
q.h.s. , Senokot two tablets b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , and
Coumadin 4 alternating with 5 mg q.p.m.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin caused a rash.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Tobacco of three packs per day times thirty years
and alcohol quit fifteen years ago. The patient
was unemployed on disability , he was a painter's rigger , and
married times 24 years with four children from his first wife , now
living with his second wife.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient's temperature was 101.6 , blood
pressure 96/60 , pulse 88 , and respirations
28. HEENT: Pupils were equal and reactive to light and
accommodation , extraocular muscles were intact , normal funduscopic
examination , no Roth spots were noted , the oropharynx was benign ,
and no petechiae were noted. NECK: Supple and there was no
lymphadenopathy , his jugular venous distention was absent , an EJ
line was in place , and there was a 2+ carotid with zero bruits.
CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Regular rate
and rhythm , S1 and S2 , and there was a holosystolic II/VI systolic
murmur at the left sternal border with no S3 or S4 noted. There
was a very crisp click from the St. Jude aortic valve. ABDOMEN:
Examination showed positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , and
non-distended. RECTAL: Refused by patient. NEUROLOGICAL:
Examination showed that the patient was alert and oriented times
three , cranial nerves II-XII were intact , motor was 5/5 in all four
extremities distally and proximally , sensory was normal to light
touch and proprioception , and the reflexes were equal and
symmetric. Cerebellar was slow , equal repetitive motions , and the
F&F was slow but equal with good tracking grossly.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Of note , his white count was 19.1 with 18
bands and 53 polys , hematocrit was 41.8 ,
and the electrolytes were all within normal range. The bilirubins
were 0.8 total , alkaline phosphatase 82 , SGPT of 15 , and his PT was
20.7 with an INR of 3.4. A transthoracic echo obtained upon
admission showed the aortic valve was in place , there was a 2.9
meters per second flow through the aortic valve , and there was no
abscess or vegetation noted. Patient had reportedly gotten two
blood cultures in Ari Norer Legulf Hospital and it turned out later that there
had only been one blood draw. One blood culture was also drawn in
the Emergency Room at the Thoter Coast Community Healthcare . Chest
x-ray showed cardiomegaly , no infiltrate , and no congestive heart
failure and his EKG at admission showed normal sinus rhythm at 89
with an axis of minus 20 , intervals were 0.26/0.90/0.36 , there was
a flipped T in lead I , aVL , V5 , and V6 , and there was first degree
AV block.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 65 year old gentleman who had had three
aortic valve replacements and had suffered
overwhelming endocarditis as recently as six months ago in the
replaced St. Jude valve at that time with a high risk valve since
patient was known to be febrile at the time of valve replacement.
Therefore , the number one problem was to rule out endocarditis.
The patient had two blood cultures , one at the Acraw Medical Center and one
at Ter'svenwhi Rywick Hospital , which were negative times 48 hours
while the patient was maintained on Vancomycin and Gentamicin. It
was judged that a TE would not change our treatment for this
gentleman and it was not obtained. An Infectious Disease
consultation was obtained and Infectious Disease recommended
observing the patient on antibiotics for an extra 24 hours before
deeming him non-bacteremic and then to observe the gentleman off
antibiotics for 24 hours before discharging him. In regards to
anti-coagulation , the patient was targeted for an INR of 3 with a
high risk prosthetic heart valve. This was easily maintained using
the patient's normal alternating 4 and 5 mg q.p.m. Coumadin. Final
issue was the patient's fall. It was judged that the patient
actually became weak and went down on all fours controlling his
fall without actual syncope. The weakness could be attributed to
the patient's nausea , vomiting , dehydration , and vasovagal. Final
issue was the non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. While the
patient was hospitalized , the Glyburide was held and patient was
maintained on a sliding scale of insulin. Patient's blood cultures
remained negative times three days while patient was treated with
Vancomycin and Gentamicin. As per Infectious Disease
recommendations , the intravenous antibiotics were held on the third
day and then patient was observed for 24 hours off antibiotics. He
continued to remain afebrile through the entire hospitalization and
patient was discharged to home on September .
DISPOSITION: Disposition is to home.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. headache ,
Ventolin two puffs inhaled b.i.d. ,
Beclovent two puffs inhaled b.i.d. , Beconase two puffs inhaled
q.i.d. p.r.n. congestion , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Meclizine 25
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Senokot tablets two
tablets p.o. q.a.m. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.o.d. alternating with 5
mg p.o. q.o.d. , every day , patient took either 4 or 5 alternating ,
and Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. Patient was not discharged on any
antibiotics.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
FOLLOW-UP: Arranged with his attending , Dr. Andre Raju for the
following week. Patient was also arranged to have an
MRI scan of his spine on Wednesday , 6/6 , at noon. This is to
rule out possibilities of osteomyelitis since patient had had low
back pain since septic events of 5/26

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Chest pain
HPI: 69y/o female w/ MMP , including CHF ( EF=50% 10/6/04 ) , NIDDM , Afib ,
and mult CVAs , was in her USOH until 8am the DOA , when she was observed
to have twitches in her eyes and mouth; during this episode , the pt.
was A&OX3/no LOC. Per report , she has not had these sx previously. VS
at the time were stable. At 8:45 am per report , the pt began moaning
and complained of left sided chest pain localized to her breast. Her
skin was noted to be clammy. The pt. reports no radiation of sx , SOB ,
N/V , palpitations , or dizziness. Proxy did note that pt had a
""congestive cough"" for past week. VS at nursing home durnig episode of
chest pain were P57-92 , BP 104/70 , O2 98%RA. Pt then brought to the RMH
ED , where she no longer c/o sx but was found to be tachy in afib w/
HR 120s-130s. In ED VS: T 99.2; BP 129/116; RR14; O2 99%RA. PE notable
for cataracts b/l , CN intact , lungs CTA b/l , CVS tachy , ?S4 , abd s/nt ,
ext www , no edema. Pt. unable to cooperate for full neurological exam.
Labs notable for K of 5.4 , Ca of 8.1 , and WCT of 15.02. EKG:tachy at
111 , reg rhythm ?sinus vs. atrial flutter. .5mm ST depression in V5 , no
TW changes , QW in 3 , aVF ( unchanged ). CXR: No evidence of pulm edema/
infiltrate. Pt given 50 mg PO lopressor and 5mg IV lopressor X 4 w/
persistent tachycardia to the low 100s.
ASSESSMENT: 69 y/o female with h/o CHF , DM , tachyarrhythmias , and CVAs
presents w/ chest pain , facial twitching. Pt admitted for stabilization
of HR and r/o MI.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1 ) CARDS:
Ischemia: Pt ruled out by enzymes/EKG X3. Did not complain of CP/ SOB
during admission. On ASA , Beta blocker
Pump: H/o CHF w/ EF 50-55% in 7/19/04. No evidence of volume overload
by PE , CXR. On lasix 20 mg po qd. Repeat ECHO 11/8/04 showed a mild
interval reduction in LV EF down to 35-40% without significant
valvular abnormalities.
Rhythm: Pt tachy to 110s on admission but hemodynamically stable. O/N
HD1 had episode of afib at 130s-140s , desat to 88%. No complaints of
CP. Given diltiazem 10 mg IV w/ return of HR to low 100s ( baseline ).
Started diltiazem 30 mg po QID w/ drop in HR to 70s-80s , w/ irregular
rhythm. Per EKG , ?sinus arrhythmia vs ?atrial fibrillation w/ normal
rate. TSH pending. On HD4 , pt. had episode of bradycardia down to 50s
( approximately 1 hour ) asymptomatic with no evidence of heart block.
Toprol XL was restarted at home dose ( 100 mg qd ) , and diltiazem was
kept at qid dosing upon discharge. Given the brief episode of
bradycardia and concerns for both bradycardia and heart block , it was
decided to place a continuous loop monitor on the patient. She will
follow up in outpatient cardiology on November and with her PCP on
November
2 ) NEURO: Has hx of CVA. Head CT on 8/17/04 shows old infarct , no new
lesion. Per proxy , pt. back to baseline mental status upon admission.
No episodes of facial twitching during admission. On aricept.
3 ) ID: WCT 15.03 w/ 86% PMNs. Pt afebrile , no evidence of infection.
Given hx. of cough , a sputum gs/cx were done and were negative. WCT
down to 8.03 by discharge. Pt. on prednisone for temporal arteritis;
this may have been the cause of the WCT elevation , but this is
unlikely as WCT dropped by discharge.
4 ) ENDO: On metformin 850 mg BID for DM. In addition , had pt. on
sliding scale insuling during admission.
5 ) FEN: Potassium initially elevated , but down to 3.8 by discharge; No
EKG changes were observed. Ca was low , and was repleted - it may have
been responsible for facial twitches. On ADA diet.
6 ) RHEUM: H/o temporal arteritis. Continued prednisone 10mg qd. ESR
rechecked on day of discharge per Dr. Newberg To be followed up
as outpatient.
7 ) CODE: FC. *Per Health proxy , Jackie Bhatia ( phone
857-284-3232 ) , pt's code status had changed to FC after being years of
DNR/DNI. Code status was revisited this hospitalization , and Ms.
Points requested that the pt. be full code. Discussed issue
with Dr. Ollhoff , who will revisit this issue with the patient and
proxy at her next appt.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please continue to take your home medications. We have added a new
medication , Diltiazem , which you need to take four times a day. In
two days , you should receive a portable heart monitor that will record
your heart rhythms continuously for one month.
Please schedule an appt. to see Dr. Mclaine within 1 week. You should see
Dr. Waylon Back in cardiology on November at 1:30 p.m. and Dr.
Guariglia on June at 1:50 p.m. If you have chest pain , shortness
of breath , dizziness , weakness , or other symptoms go to the ER.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Pt. to follow up with Dr. Peloquin on 9/17/04 at 3:50 p.m. For HR
control , pt. started on diltiazem 30 mg QID. Will likely transition to
long-acting diltiazem as an outpatient. Pt has been scheduled to see
Dr. Mcgrue in cardiology for consideration of amio for heart rate
control. Pt to be sent home with loop monitor for possible
bradycardia/heart block on nodal agents.

1989 and being followed by a cardiologist in Prora who
presented to Stem,delfgilm Hospital in Nah Coton- An on 9/27/06 with chest pain
and shortness breath. Until 3/22 , he had been feeling generally
well without limiting dyspnea , fatigue , or chest pain. Since
then he has had two inpatient admissions in Hay Irv Co for
CHF. He complains of marked increase in dyspnea on exertion and
fatigue as well as PND/nocturia for the past three to four
months. He developed chest pressure and shortness of breath in

with critical coronary anatomy/valve dysfunction. There is a
history of class III heart failure. Recent signs and symptoms of
congestive heart failure include paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea/dyspnea on exertion/pulmonary edema on chest x-ray/pedal
edema. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. The patient has a
history of atrial fibrillation/flutter treated with drugs/beta
blocker.

bilateral lower extremities mottled to stable , good pedal pulses
bilaterally. Continuing to monitor. On postop day #2 ,
hematocrit 25.3 , transfused two units PRBC. Hemodynamically
stable. On postop day #3 , extubated , off pressors. Failed video
swallow evaluation. He was transferred to Step-Down Unit on
postoperative day #3.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: No issues.
Cardiovascular: No issues. On aspirin , Lopressor , and Coumadin.
Respiratory: No issues. Have been extubated on postop day #2.
GI: N.p.o. Video swallow showed aspiration. Nutrition will
continue to follow with recommendations.
Renal: No issues.
Endocrine: No issues.
Hematology: Anticoagulated with aspirin and Coumadin. Recent
mitral valve repair/atrial fib.
ID: No issues.
Of note , recent video swallow , the patient needs Dobbhoff tubes
for meds p.o. until Nutrition gives further Rx.
On the Step-Down Unit , starting postop day #3 , no narcotics. An
88-year-old status post circ arrest confused , impulsive and on
sitter , Pacing wire remains in place.
On postop day #4 , rate controlled A fib , hypertensive , added
low-dose captopril to Lopressor 12.5 q.i.d. , diuresing well ,
remains on 1.5 L O2 , strict n.p.o. for aspiration per Speech and
Swallow. On tube feeds via Dobbhoff , confusion improving , no
narcotics/sedatives. UA sent for MS changes , negative for UTI.
Wires discontinued. Coumadin for A fib. Rehabilitation
screening initiated.
On postop day #5 , rate controlled A fib , Coumadin. BP still
hypertensive , increased captopril to 12.5 t.i.d. Ambulating with
PT on room air. Dobbhoff in place. All meds/nutrition via
Dobbhoff. Postop echo ordered for MVP. Off sitters today , clear
mental status. No narcotics/sedatives. UA clean.
On postop day #6 , rate controlled A fib. BP improved on
captopril. Cards following , recommending to preferentially
increase Lopressor and decrease captopril as tolerated. Of note ,
the patient has been quite hypertensive this week with heart rate
well controlled even low-dose Lopressor. Increased Lopressor to
25 mg q.i.d. , captopril 12.5 t.i.d. Creatinine 0.4 , has diuresed
well. Postop echo with an EF of 45% to 50% , moderate LVH ,
hypokinetic anterior septal and inferior wall , normal RV. Severe
LAE and RAE , paravalvular leak seen at AVR with mild AI , trace
MR , mild TR. Also has large left pleural effusion , was seen on
echo. Only small bilateral effusions were seen on chest x-ray.
The patient's main issue now is PT and Speech and Swallow
reassessment. Dobbhoff was repositioned today for tube in
stomach with tip newly pointing upwards into the esophagus.
Post-repositioning KUB shows tip now downwards in stomach. Given
some Reglan to advance. Clear mental status. Junky cough cannot
produce sputum for sample. Afebrile. White count 9.8.
Nutrition and EMS Rx followed , has recovered very well ,
ambulating on room air.
On postop day #7 , repeat video swallow scheduled for Monday.
Coumadin started. Coumadin continued and started Plavix for LAD
endarterectomy , off aspirin. Possible PEG placement pending
video swallow results. Repeat chest x-ray with minimal left
effusion.
On postop day #8 , holding Coumadin for possible PEG next week
pending video swallow on Monday. No heparin for now per Dr.
Ernesto Umbel
On postop day #9 , tube feeds off at midnight , getting repeat
video swallow on a.m. for speech and swallow. Holding Coumadin ,
which was given for chronic A fib pending possible PEG placement.
On postop day #10 , A fib/room air. Video swallow study showed
improvement , but patient still silently aspirating. Speech and
swallow recommends PEG and continued work with Speech and Swallow
for eventual goal of patient taking p.o.'s. Contacted Metabolic
Support. They will send someone to evaluate the patient for PEG ,
so the procedure will likely take place on Wednesday or Thursday.
On postop day #11 , A fib/room air , feeding tubes were part way
out , readvanced and got KUB showing good placement. Metabolic
support evaluated the patient , got consent for PEG.
On postop day #12 , A fib/room air , holding tube feeds and
Coumadin for PEG placement , scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday. No
heparin per Dr. Christman May go to rehab once INR therapeutic for
A fib. The patient had a four-beat run of VT.
On postop day #13 , he was supposed to have PEG placed today.
Metabolic support said that someone called the OR desk yesterday
and canceled the procedure , so it was rescheduled for Tuesday due
to no OR availability. Otherwise , the patient was supposed to
have repeat video swallow next week. Hemodynamically stable.
Holding Coumadin. Rehabilitation when ready.
On postop day #14 , PEG tube placement rescheduled for next
Tuesday , giving low-dose Coumadin for A fib , at goal tube feeds
through Dobhoff , hemodynamically stable.
On postop day #15 , doing well. General surgery consult called to
try and get PEG placed earlier the next Tuesday. Dr. Len Dechart will do it either tomorrow or Monday at the latest.
Otherwise , doing well , n.p.o. after midnight. Hopefully , he will
get PEG and can go to rehabilitation.
On postop day #16 , tube feeding restarted. PEG placement
tomorrow. Otherwise , doing well , rate controlled A fib.
Rehabilitation once PEG tube placed.
On postop day #17 , finally received peg today , currently on D5 in
a half at 50 mL an hour , okay to give meds through PEG and can
restart tube feeds tomorrow. NG tube out. Coumadin to restart
tonight. PT/rehabilitation screening.
On postop day #18 , started tube feeds this morning , advancing
rate without difficulty. The patient ambulating with assistance ,
rate controlled A fib/2 L O2 stable. Plan to rehab tomorrow.
The patient was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery Service to be stable
to discharge to rehabilitation on postop day #19 with the
following discharge instructions.

for sick sinus syndrome , multiple strokes x4 , diabetes mellitus
type 2 and COPD , who was recently admitted to the Ghampemaw A Hospital for
bacteremia with Streptococcus oralis without a clear source. His
white blood cell count had increased to 20. His INR had been
supratherapeutic on admission at that time to 14. At that time ,
he had had a transesophageal echocardiogram which did not show
any vegetations and he was discharged to rehab on 3/15/06 with a
course of IV penicillin through a PICC line , as well as oral
Flagyl empirically for an elevated white count. At the rehab
facility where he was placed , the patient was found to have
pulled his PICC line and the patient was complaining of being
short of breath and having some mental status changes. He was
treated with some sublingual nitroglycerin at the outside
facility and brought to the Ellwis Medical Center Emergency Room , where a chest
x-ray showed some lack of the PICC line and the short of breath
quickly improved in the emergency room. He was , however ,
lethargic and then at times , apneic in the emergency room. A gas
was performed which showed respiratory alkalosis with a pH of
7.5 , a pCO2 of 34 and a pAO2 of 135. The patient then became
slightly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures to the 90s ,
was given IV fluid boluses as well as treated empirically with
vancomycin and ceftazidime , to which his blood pressure responded
by going up to around 100-110/60. Given his apnea , a CPAP was
initiated in the emergency department and his oxygenation issues
quickly resolved. A head CT was performed , which was negative.
A right internal jugular line was placed and gentle rehydration
therapy according to early goal-directed therapy for peri-sepsis
was initiated , given the presumption of repeat bacteremia and
early sepsis. He was admitted to medicine for further
management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post MI in
2004 and a cath in 2005. He is status post a hip fracture in
2005. He has peripheral vascular disease , diabetes , COPD but not
reported to be on any home oxygenation , dementia , Paget disease ,
atrial fibrillation , BPH , congestive heart failure , EF of 45-50% ,
hypertension , diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included the following: Glucotrol 10 mg
p.o. b.i.d. and lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day , metformin 500 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. x10 days which was started
on 5/5/06 , sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n. , nystatin suspension
q.i.d. , Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.o. q. h.s. , Penicillin G 3 million units
IV q. 4h x7 days , Milk of Magnesia , Tylenol p.r.n. , Dulcolax
p.r.n. , Colace p.r.n. , atenolol 50 mg q. day , Lipitor 20 mg q.
day , Senna liquid q. h.s. , Flomax 0.4 q. day.
ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a history of heavy tobacco use. He quit
40 years ago. He lives at home with a 24-hour attendant and he
rarely uses alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM notable for the following: His
temperature was 95.9 , his heart rate was 60 , his blood pressure
was 110/62. He is satting 98% on a CPAP machine. In general , he
was in no acute distress in restraints. His head and neck exam
was notable for a supple neck. Pupils are equal , round and
reactive. His heart demonstrated a regular rate and rhythm. His
JVP was flat. He did not demonstrate any murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. His pulmonary exam was clear anteriorly. His abdominal
exam was noted for being soft , nontender , and nondistended with
positive bowel sounds and mild tympani. He had good peripheral
pulses with trace lower extremity edema. His neuro exam was
nonfocal.
OPERATIONS: During his hospital stay at this time included a PEG
tube placement which happened on 10/25/06.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. ID: The patient has a history of recent strep oralis
bacteremia and leukocytosis. He was afebrile at the time of
admission; however , given concern for possible early sepsis given
his blood pressure , he was treated with empiric IV fluids and
antibiotics with vancomycin and ceftazidime. His chest x-ray
looked like it might have some aspiration and he was treated with
an empiric 7-day course of Ceptaz and Flagyl for aspiration
pneumonia. This course was completed earlier in his hospital
stay. He was also initially treated with vancomycin. A PICC was
placed on 8/7/06 for further antibiotic management of his
bacteremia. His vancomycin was switched to IV penicillin and
this will be continued for a full 3-4 week course on 1/15/07. A
TEE was considered unnecessary given the fact that he was going
to be treated anyway with antibiotics for 4 weeks. All blood ,
urine , sputum cultures and stool cultures remained no growth to
date at the time of discharge.
2. Pulmonary: As mentioned above , the patient demonstrated some
apnea in the Emergency Department which resolved with CPAP;
however , given the fact that the patient was a significant
aspiration risk , a CPAP was considered unnecessary and possibly
would increase the risk of aspiration. Pulmonary was consulted ,
who felt that the patient was demonstrating Cheyne-Stokes
respirations secondary to possible CHF or history of CVAs that he
has had in the past. His ABG , as I mentioned above , demonstrated
respiratory alkalosis with a mild metabolic alkalosis as well.
His repeat ABG showed no significant change , which likely
indicates a chronic process. He did not demonstrate any PEs on
studies that were performed here. No pneumonia was noted and the
desaturations that were detected while the patient was sleeping
overnight on 15 units O2 sat monitor resolved quickly with 2
liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. A plan was made to not
reinitiate CPAP given the aspiration risk. He was initially
diuresed mildly with Lasix. This was eventually discontinued.
The patient should receive nighttime supplemental oxygen ,
particularly if he desaturates to less than 90%.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient is status post an MI , status
post PCI in 2004. His enzymes were negative on this admission
and a repeat EKG was unchanged from previous. The patient was
restarted on his home doses of aspirin , statin , beta blocker 2
pump. The patient's ejection fraction was 45-50% with inferior
wall hypokinesis. Hypotension improved on admission , restarted
his beta blocker and his ACE inhibitor and IV fluids at the time
of discharge. Re the patient's history of a-fib , he was in
normal sinus rhythm for the majority of his hospital stay.
Coumadin was held peri-procedure when he was getting his PEG
placed and vitamin K had been administered in view of his
supratherapeutic Coumadin. His Coumadin should be restarted on
2/18/07. Of note as well for rhythm issues , the patient was
kept on potassium and magnesium scales while in hospital and he
has a partial pacemaker placed for his sick sinus syndrome.
4. GI: The patient had a history of constipation. His abdomen
was tympanitic when he first presented. He was given a bowel
regimen and has subsequently begun making good solid stool.
Midway through his hospital course , the patient developed trouble
with eating. He had multiple NG tubes placed which he was
self-discontinuing requiring urgent reconsideration of more
permanent feeding tubes. A discussion was held between our
service and the GI team , who felt that a PEG would be useful for
managing this patient's feeding in the future. On 10/1/06 , GI
endoscopically placed a PEG tube for future feeding. Nutrition
was consulted and tube feeds were re-initiated that evening.
Again , his Coumadin will be held until 9/14/07 so as to promote
appropriate wound healing around the site of the PEG placement.
5. Heme: The patient had a history of anemia but did not
demonstrate any acute hematocrit drops. His INR on admission was
1.9. We had transiently restarted Coumadin but he will have to
restart that again on 9/14/07 , given the fact that it was held
for his PEG placement. He was continued on iron supplements
during his hospital stay.
6. Renal: The patient , as discussed above , has demonstrated a
respiratory alkalosis with a mild metabolic alkalosis as well.
His creatinine was mildly elevated which is secondary to chronic
renal insufficiency for unclear reasons. His creatinine by the
time of discharge had improved dramatically to 0.7.
7. Endocrine: The patient's oral hypoglycemics were held during
this hospital stay. He was started on insulin sliding-scale and
Lantus. As his feeding has increased and his tube feeds have
reached goal , his Lantus has had to be titrated up. He is
currently at 15 units q. p.m. He may need more while at the
facility that he is going to.
8. GU: The patient has a history of vesiculous spermatocele or
hydrocele , which is going to be followed by urology as an
outpatient. We had held his Flomax initially given low blood
pressure but we restarted it during his hospital stay here.
9. FEN: As mentioned above , the patient is on aspiration
precautions secondary to speech and swallow evaluation that was
consistent with aspiration. NG tubes were placed multiple times
but were self-discontinued by the patient. Finally , a PEG tube
was placed on 3/2 and tube feeds were reinitiated that evening.
10: Psych: The patient has a history of being mildly agitated.
Zyprexa was initiated here at home doses of 2.5 mg q. day and
then titrated up to 2.5 mg b.i.d. The patient has responded very
nicely to this and is no longer agitated.
11. Prophylaxis: He was kept on TEDS and P-boots. Coumadin as
mentioned above will need to be restarted on 9/14/07 and Nexium
was to continue while he is here.
The patient is full code. His contacts include his son ( 755 ) 304-4394 and Hillesheim , his daughter ( 041 ) 769-5379.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: See addendum
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a temperature of 98.4 T
max , his current is 96.6. His heart rate is in the 90s. His
blood pressure has been stable in the 110-120s/70-80s. His
respirations have been 18-20 , satting 92-96% on room air. In
general , he is in no acute distress. His lungs are with coarse
bilateral breath sounds. His rate and rhythm were regular
without murmurs. His abdomen is soft and nontender with good
bowel sounds. His extremities are without edema.
He is to be discharged today , 2/27/06 , to rehabilitation where
they will focus primarily on his physical therapy and rehab
needs.

Discharge Date: 3/23/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HEMOPTYSIS.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS:
1. SINUSITIS.
2. STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old gentleman
status post cardiac transplant ( 11/27 )
who was transferred to the Nasstrict Hospital Of with a
history of hemoptysis.
The patient underwent cardiac transplantation in 1991 for severe
ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient had a rather unremarkable
course except for the development of some graft CAD ( seen on last
catheterization ). The patient was admitted from 11/17/96 to
6/24/96 with a two month history of sputum production. The
patient was empirically started on IV cefotaxime and his
cyclosporine was adjusted up to 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient's
shortness of breath and respiratory problems subsequently resolved.
A CT of the chest showed prior granulomatous involvement of the
lung and spleen. The patient had AFB times three done: all
negative. The patient did have Mycobacterium avium grow out in his
sputum; however , this organism was not felt to be a pathogen for
him. After the patient was discharged , the patient continued
continued to have persistent ear fullness and pain , and a thick ,
but clear , nasal discharge. Then , approximately one week ago , the
patient noted increasing cough. The patient denies any associated
fevers or chills. On the day prior to admission , the patient noted
his sputum was blood tinged. The patient subsequently coughed up
approximately one quarter cup of bright red blood , which was
apparently witnessed in the Emergency Room at the outside hospital.
The patient apparently had some more hemoptysis ( amount not
documented ) on the night of admission; however , the patient has not
had any further hemoptysis since then ( approximately 20 hours ).
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Status post cardiac transplantation in
1991 ( secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy ).
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 3. Status post coronary
artery bypass graft. 4. Status post a left ventral hernia repair.
5. Status post a right ankle fracture. 6. Status post goring by
bull in 1987. 7. Liver laceration. 8. Hypertension. 9. Peripheral
vascular disease.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Cyclosporine 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2.
Cardizem CD 180 mg p.o. q.day. 3. Imuran
175 mg p.o. q.h.s.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife in Jo The patient was a janitor until 1/19 The
patient smoked a half pack per day times 30 years. The patient
drinks only socially ( occasionally ).
FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a myocardial infarction at age 78.
Mother alive , but has diabetes mellitus ,
congestive heart failure , and coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On vitals , temperature was 97.9 , blood
pressure 160/100 , heart rate 106 ,
respirations 20 , and O2 saturation 96% on two liters. The patient
is an elderly gentleman lying in his bed in no acute distress.
HEENT examination was normocephalic , atraumatic. Pupils were
equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular
muscles were intact. There was no lymphadenopathy. JVP was
approximately 7 cm , with no carotid bruits. Cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. Abdomen had positive bowel sounds , obese ,
nontender , and nondistended. Extremities had 2+ bilateral lower
extremity edema. Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: SMA-7 was notable for glucose 284 , creatinine
1.2. CBC revealed a white count of 4 , hematocrit
35.2 , and platelets 191 , 000. PT was 13 , PTT 28.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient had no hemoptysis throughout his
Mo Hospital hospitalization.
The patient was scheduled for , and underwent , bronchoscopy on
4/3/96 , which revealed bronchiectasis of the anterior segment of
the left lower lobe ( where the CT abnormalities were seen ).
Purulent secretions were also encountered and sent for appropriate
cultures and tests. No evidence of malignancy was seen. The
Pulmonary team did recommend starting the patient on appropriate
antimicrobial coverage for MAI. Therefore , the patient was started
on clarithromycin and ethambutol. Given that these medications
effect the liver cytochrome P450 system , the patient's cyclosporine dose
required adjustment downward to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. to keep his levels
200-300. The patient also underwent CT scan of his maxillofacial
area on 9/12/96. This scan revealed air levels in both maxillary
sinuses , as well as the sphenoid sinuses. Subtotal opacification
was seen in most of the ethmoid air cells. Also , subtotal
opacification of the mastoid air cells was demonstrated
bilaterally. The frontal sinuses appeared minimally developed; of
the few air cells present , there was complete opacification. The
overall impression was pain and sinus disease with left
otomastoiditis. The patient underwent further evaluation in the
ENT Clinic on 7/24/96 ; their recommendations included Biaxin times
four weeks ( the patient will be on this medication for at least
four weeks for coverage of MAI ). The Infectious Disease team
recommends that the patient's repeat AFBs be followed up and , if
they are followed up , clarithromycin and ethambutol could be
stopped after six weeks versus 18-24 months of therapy. The
Pulmonary team also recommended that the patient be started on
Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers and have a set of pulmonary
function tests obtained as an outpatient. It is also recommended
that the patient be started on a cholesterol lowering agent at his
next Transplant Clinic visit ( LDL came back at 151 after patient's
discharge ).
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Procardia XL 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
cyclosporine 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , ethambutol
1 , 500 mg p.o. q.day , Atrovent metered dose inhaler two puffs
q.i.d. , Imuran 175 mg p.o. q.h.s. , clarithromycin 500 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Afrin two sprays n.a. b.i.d. times three days , and Ocean
Spray two sprays n.a. q.day.
CONDITION: Fair.
DISPOSITION: To home , follow up appointment in the Transplant
Clinic on 8/26/96 ; the patient also instructed to
arrange a follow up appointment with Dr. Gullace ( Pulmonary ). The
patient should have cyclosporine levels monitored carefully ,
especially over the next week or two.

PMH includes HTN , hypercholesterolemia , prior TIA vs. stroke 10/26
( manifest as slurred speech , left arm and leg weakness ). prior
myocardial infarction ( 1984 ) , and history of left Bell's palsy x 3 with
chronic weakness of facial expression muscles on the left. She had a
possible patent foramen ovale with agitated saline contrast passage on
valsalva maneuver TTE when she was admitted 11/25 for stroke work-up.
Recently , this woman has had 2-weeks of general fatigue , exertional dys
pnea , frequent headaches , and intermittent blurred vision while driving
followed by a 2-3 second episode of binocular visual loss 4/13/03.
Notably , she ran out of amlodipine and reports obtaining a level of
240/150 on self-monitoring. One day prior to admission she saw her PCP
who noted hypertension and referred her to an ophthalmologist , who
obtained a normal exam by report.
She awoke this morning with a more severe right frontal headache with
pain radiating to the right shoulder. She also experienced a problem
with gait , leaning to the right. Her husband phoned EMS because she had
a severe headache and seemed ""confused."" At present , the patient denies
headache and confusion , as well as diplopia , vertigo , dysphagia , and
dysarthria. She denies recent chest pain , but has had orthopnea.

NEURO: MS significant for no deficits on orientation , attention , langua
ge , memory , and praxis. CN exam significant for right hypertropic skew ,
left facial droop , mostly lower face but with weak eyebrow raise as
well. Motor exam with normal tone , no pronator drift , strength 5/5 in
all muscle groups in upper and lower extremities. Coordination exam
with slightly slowed fine finger movements , right hand , normal
performance on finger-nose-finger and heel-knee-shin , sensory exam
without deficits in light touch , temperature , vibratory sensation ,
reflexes 2 throughout except for 1 in the ankles , toes downgoing
bilaterally. GAIT slightly wided based but stable gait with upright
posture , normal arm-swing. No difficulty with heel , or toe walk. Falls
to left on tandem gait.
Non-contrast head CT negative for evidence of stroke or hemorrhage.
Hospital course: the pt was admitted with hypertension and recent
headaches , visual changes ( blurred vision ) , change in gait ( inability
to walk in heels ) , and recent confusion. Neurologic exam was
significant for right hypertropic skew without diplopia , left facial
weakness that is old per pt and LMR notes , mild slowing of right fine
finger movements , and tendency to fall towards the left on tandem gait.
These findings do not localize well and the differential diagnosis
was felt to include cerebral ischemia/infarction and hypertensive
encephalopathy. The patient had recent poorly-controlled
hypertension as well as symptoms of possible heart failure including
exertional dyspnea and orthopnea.
An MRI was ordered to evaluate for possible stroke or hypertensive
encephalopathy. Unfortunately , the pt was not able to tolerate the
procedure , citing claustrophobia from a traumatic childhood experience
as a prohibitive factor. Her atenolol was continued and she was placed
on aspirin 325 mg qd for stroke and heart prophylaxis. Her blood
pressures remained well-controlled throughout admission and she
remained asymptomatic , without recurrent headache , confusion , and
weakness. Her fine finger movements with the right hand were improved
by hospital day 2. She continued to have difficulty with tandem gait ,
falling to the left. Her lipid profile revealed elevated total
cholesterol and LDL. Her homocysteine level was slightly elevated at
14. She was instructed to raise her dose of atorvastatin as well as
supplement her diet with folic acid. She has an outpt appointment for
carotid non-invasive studies 10/25/03.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:
The pt should take a full dose of aspirin ( 325 mg ). She should take
folate supplementation. She should also discuss raising her dose of
atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) with her PCP , because her cholesterol and LDL
were elevated this admission.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: LEFT HIP FRACTURE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. FAT EMBOLI SYNDROME.
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
3. DECUBITUS ULCERS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Lumadue is a 68-year-old man who
came in with a chief complaint of hip
pain after a mechanical fall. The patient had been hospitalized in
4/17 for ischemic right toes requiring debridement and amputation.
At that time , his hospital course was complicated by a non-Q wave
MI. Cardiology have recommended medical management with Lopressor
at that time and an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of
45%. Dobutamine MIBI revealed a severe fixed perfusion defect in
the inferoposterior and inferoseptal left ventricle without any
peri-infarct ischemia. Ejection fraction by MIBI imaging was 26%
in contrast to the echo results. The patient was ultimately
discharged on Lopressor , however , she stopped taking the Lopressor
for unclear reasons. For the few months prior to admission , he
developed increasing dyspnea on exertion with paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and increasing pedal edema , as well as nocturia , however ,
denied any orthopnea , any chest pain , fevers , melena , bright red
blood per rectum or palpitations. A few days prior to admission ,
the patient developed a dry cough and some rhinorrhea.
On the morning of admission , the patient sustained a mechanical
fall while trying to retrieve a newspaper. He had no
light-headedness , palpitations , pain in his chest , nausea or
vomiting , sweating or change in vision or sensory symptoms prior to
or after the fall. The patient fell onto his left side and
immediately developed left-sided leg and hip pain for which she
presented to the emergency room at Fentstraub Neycian's Medical Center .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , cardiomyopathy
( ischemic ) , peripheral vascular disease ,
status post amputation of right-sided toes , status post right
femoral to PT avascularization , diabetes type II , status post CVA ,
hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: HCTZ 50 mg p.o. q.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d. , Zestril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , glyburide 5 mg
p.o. q.d. , multivitamins , cough medicine p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: Aminoglycosides , unknown reaction.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of smoking one pack per
day x40 years , quit five years prior to admission.
He has one drink of liquor per day , lives at home alone in Targtine Highway , Birm , Vermont 21711 , and is in the insurance business.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for mother died of cancer at 74. Father
died at 55 of heart disease. Mother died at 50 of
a heart attack.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Afebrile , temperature 97.3 ,
heart rate 106 , blood pressure 162/77 ,
oxygenation 94% on room air. GENERAL: He was alert and oriented.
LUNGS: Clear. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. PELVIS: Stable.
His left lower extremity had well-healed scars from donor site for
bypass grafting , strong dopplerable PT and DP pulses. His left leg
was externally rotated. Sensation was intact to light touch.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 135 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 102 , bicarb
19 , BUN 56 , creatinine 2.5. White count 12 ,
hematocrit 33 , platelets 388. PTT 40.5 , INR 1.2. EKG showed sinus
tach at 102 , with occasional PVCs , normal axis , normal intervals ,
no evidence of ischemia. Chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary
edema. X-rays of his left pelvis and femur revealed fracture of
the left intertrochanter and subtrochanteric fracture with lesser
trochanteric fracture intact by 3 cm , less than five degrees
angulation. His femoral head was reduced.
IMPRESSION: A 68-year-old man with significant cardiac history
and vascular disease , status post left hip fracture
with mechanical fall , with pulmonary edema noted on chest x-ray.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - Initially , the patient was
to be admitted to the orthopedic service with
medicine consult for wrist stratification. However , the patient
was transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation and
management. The patient was noted to have a troponin leak although
CK enzymes remained negative for ischemia. He had a MIBI performed
which revealed an unchanged fixed defect. He remained in sinus
tach with occasional PVCs and runs of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia lasting 3-4 beats at a time throughout his admission.
Sinus tach was attributed pain and discomfort , possibly with
element of hypoxia contributing as well. A troponin leak was
attributed to strain particularly in the setting of his
tachycardia. He was started on beta blocker , Ace inhibitor and
continued on an aspirin. He was aggressively diuresed with
afterload reduction. He was titrated upward as noted.
2. Pulmonary - The patient's crackles persisted on lung exam after
aggressive diuresis , prompting performance of a chest CT which
revealed an interstitial pattern with peripheral nodularity
consistent with fat emboli syndrome , positive component of
congestive heart failure and aspiration pneumonia as well. The
patient was continued on a regimen of Lasix for diuresis and was
treated for aspiration pneumonia as noted below. His oxygen
requirement diminished over a few days and he was maintained on two
liters of nasal cannula oxygen at the time of transfer to rehab.
3. Renal - The patient developed some renal failure in the setting
of diuresis , which improved with hydration. The patient
subsequently tolerated further diuresis with improvement in his
creatinine and it is possible that renal failure is due to fat
emboli syndrome as well and should improve slowly.
4. ID - The patient was treated with vancomycin , Flagyl and
levofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia , course completed
6/18/02. The patient remained afebrile. His white blood count on
admission and discharge was 12.
5. Neurologically - The patient apparently had baseline mild
perfusion. The possibly worsened due to the fat embolic syndrome
and was at baseline prior to discharge per the patient's daughter.
6. Heme - The patient was continued on Lovenox 60 mg subcu. b.i.d.
for prophylaxis against DVT post-hip surgery to continue for six
months minimal followed by orthopedic surgery.
7. GI - The patient developed some diarrhea. C. diff. cultures
were negative to date at the time of discharge. The patient was
maintained on Nexium prophylaxis in the setting of his
anticoagulation.
8. Endocrine - The patient was restarted on oral hypoglycemics
prior to discharge in addition to sliding scale insulin. The
patient had a Foley and a triple lumen catheter , both of which were
removed on 6/18/02. The patient was evaluated by plastic surgery
for his peripheral vascular disease with ulcers. Recommended dry
sterile dressings to the right and left foot wound changed q.d.
with DuoDerm to the left lower leg wound to be changed q.3 days ,
with pressure sore prevention.
9. FEN - The patient was discharged on standing 20 mEq of K-Dur
q.d. It is likely to be checked q.o.d. to monitor for any further
requirements particularly in the setting of his runs of
nonsustained V-tach as noted above.
10. Ortho - The patient is followed daily by orthopedic surgery
and was discharged with staples on his left lower extremities to be
discontinued per orthopedic surgery recommendations in the future.
11. Disposition - The patient was stable for discharge to rehab on
7/28/02. He was to follow up with his primary care physician ,
orthopedic surgery , cardiology , and pulmonary medicine within the
next two weeks. His labs are to be drawn for a metabolic panel ,
magnesium and calcium q.o.d. for as long as the primary care
physician feels it is necessary with repletion of his electrolytes
as needed. He is to have physical therapy performed as needed.
His weightbearing status is non-weightbearing on the left lower
extremity and weightbearing as tolerated on his right lower
extremity per orthopedic surgery at the time of discharge.
DISCHARGE DIET: ADA diet , low fat , low cholesterol , low salt.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , hold for

Discharge Date: 3/2/1995
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE WITH UNSTABLE ANGINA.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HISTORY OF CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS
SURGERY IN 1988.
2 ) ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE SINCE 1983.
3 ) INFERIOR WALL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN
1988.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year old man with
a history of ischemic heart disease
since 1983. He had a non-Q wave myocardial infarction at this time
and in 1988 , he had an inferior wall myocardial infarction and a
subsequent coronary artery bypass graft times three. In 1991 , he
sustained an inferoposterior myocardial infarction and persantine
thallium study demonstrated a fixed inferolateral defect. He was
well maintained on beta blockers and aspirin until September 1992.
At this time , he developed symptoms consistent with unstable
angina. He was ruled out for myocardial infarction at this time.
An echo was significant for hypokinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls and ejection fraction was noted to be 50%.
Persantine thallium in September 1995 demonstrated posterobasilar
defect with 60% redistribution. After this episode , he had again
been symptom free. On 9/13/95 , the patient began experiencing
substernal chest pressure , 10/10 , with radiation to the left arm
with good response to sublingual nitroglycerin with total episode
time of five minutes. On 11/23/95 , he had a similar episode for
approximately two minutes which he rated as a 7/10. On the day of
admission , the patient had a fifty minute 10/10 episode of
substernal chest pressure associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea.
EKG was significant only for non-specific low T waves. Patient was
heparinized , provided with beta blockers , and given aspirin and
nitrates. The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction and the
plan was to do a persantine thallium. The patient continued to
have pain of the chest at rest and was transferred to the Caus Memorial Hospital for further evaluation and cardiac
catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above as well as significant for polio
with subsequent muscle weakness of the left
hip and leg.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission were notable for Lopressor 50 mg
q.6h. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
nitroglycerin intravenous infusion 20 micrograms per minute , and
Heparin 1300 units per hour.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs on admission were notable for a
blood pressure of 112-116/64-84 with a heart
rate of 53-75 , extraocular movements were intact , there was no
jugular venous distention , carotids were 2+ bilaterally , lungs were
clear to auscultation , and cardiac examination showed the point of
maximal intensity was non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm ,
normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , no gallops , and no rubs. Abdomen was
soft , non-tender , and non-distended with no hepatosplenomegaly ,
extremities showed no cyanosis and no edema , femoral pulses were 2+
bilaterally without bruit , and pedal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was notable for a hematocrit
of 40.3 , a white count of 10.8 , potassium
of 3.7 , PT and PTT of 12.7 and 55 with an INR of 1.1 , and
cholesterol was noted to be 287.
HOSPITAL COURSE: While here , Mr. Mollema had one episode of 10/10
substernal chest pressure not associated with
diaphoresis , nausea , or vomiting and relieved with sublingual
nitroglycerin. EKG with pain as compared to old EKG demonstrated
inversion of T waves in V1 through V3 and questionable inversions
in III and F. These inversions were present on a 11/28/95 EKG but
not on a 6/25/95 EKG. The EKG changes with the past medical
history was most likely significant of ongoing instability of the
patient's anginal symptoms and ischemic heart disease. At this
time , the plan was for cardiac catheterization. This is a 57 year
old male with a history of multiple myocardial infarctions in the
past status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1988
admitted with unstable angina and recurrent chest pain at rest.
Aspirin , Heparin , nitrates , and beta blockers were continued.
Cardiac catheterization results were notable for three vessel
disease but the bypass grafts , the LIMA to the left anterior
descending , was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the proximal
descending artery was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the ramus
was occluded , and the left circumflex to the saphenous vein graft
to the ramus may be the culprit lesion contributing to the
patient's pain and EKG changes. The patient was continued on
Heparin overnight post-catheterization and it was deemed
appropriate to PTCA the ramus lesion. The patient was taken to the
Catheterization Laboratory on 1/11/95 for successful PTCA of the
ramus occlusion. Post-procedure , the patient was stable and chest
pain free. Post-catheterization , the patient was afebrile with a
blood pressure of 106/68 and a pulse of 64. The right femoral
catheter site was without hematoma , no bruits , and femoral pulses
were 2+. Dorsalis pedis pulses were intact bilaterally and there
was no cyanosis. The patient was enrolled on the AMH protocol as
per Dr. Androsky and as such , received 36 hours of intravenous
protocol therapy post-catheterization. The right groin sheaths
were removed without difficulty , hematocrit at this time was 35.7 ,
and the patient remained in stable condition with complaint of
chest pain. The patient was discharged home on the fourth hospital
day. Physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of
130/80 , a pulse of 65 , respiratory rate of 20 , temperature of 99.4 ,
O2 saturations of 93 and 94% , and examination was within normal
limits. Cardiac examination showed the point of maximal intensity
non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm , and no murmurs , gallops , or
rubs.
DISPOSITION: The patient is stable upon discharge and symptom
free.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. and
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. four times a day.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Quincy Noble Aldo Zeyadeh at
Vere Hospital

ATTENDING: SEABROOKE , ODELL FORREST MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON ADMISSION: Non-ST elevation , acute
myocardial infarction , and acute renal failure. She was
transferred from the C A Hospital to the Ersullcy Medical Center
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old lady with
diabetes and known coronary artery disease status post CABG and
status post multiple PCIs. She was in her usual state of health
until three weeks ago when she began with classical paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea. She was taken to Ordland University Of Medical Center on
three different occasions in the past three weeks prior to
admission , where she was treated for pulmonary edema. Prior to
her admission to the I.marg Healthcare , she had had a
troponin leak of up to 3.6. This was on the 5 of July . She also was admitted with acute renal failure. Her
creatinine on the 15 of June per note was 1.1. When we
admitted her creatinine was 2.6. This was likely secondary to
the fact that she had received amikacin for urinary tract
infection at the Tawno Health and she had also had a
chest , abdominal , and pelvis contrast CT leading to contrast
nephropathy. When she was admitted , her main problems were the
following: She had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
She was a high-risk patient with a TIMI score of 5. She had
acute renal failure probably secondary to a number of factors
including contrast dye what she had received at the outside
hospital and amikacin which she had received for urinary tract
infection. Her other problem was she had a urinary tract
infection per report secondary to E. Coli resistant to Levaquin
and gentamicin.
Her past medical history was relevant for the following:
She had diabetes type 2 with chronic renal insufficiency
secondary to the diabetes. She has anxiety disorder. She had
coronary artery disease status post CABG in 1992. She is status
post PCI with a stent placed in 2002 , and 2004 apparently. She
also had congestive heart failure with an EF per an echo
performed at Burg Man'stard Memorial Hospital was 35%. She had GERD and
Barrett's esophagus. She had hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia. She had had a pacemaker placed. She had
hemorrhoids. She had osteoarthritis with both knees. She had
spinal stenosis and chronic back pain status post cholecystectomy
and a history of asthma.
Her allergies included the following: Bactrim , penicillin ,
erythromycin , Keflex , Metformin , clindamycin , and ciprofloxacin.
Her social history , she was in a nursing facility. She is
divorced. She has four kinds. Lives in Gle and is often
visited by her children.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her temperature was 96 , her
pulse 77 , her blood pressure was 170/95 , although admittedly it
was difficult taking her blood pressure by auscultation. This
was measured by palpation and confirmed by Doppler. She was
satting 96% on 3.5 L via nasal cannula. She is alert and
oriented x3 in no acute distress. She had arcus senilis. Her
extraocular movements are intact. She had pupils equal , round ,
and reactive to light. Her chest showed bibasilar crackles/rales
two-thirds way up. Her JVP is 10 cm water. Her heart had a
regular rate and rhythm with no gallop. No rubs or murmurs
heard. Her abdomen is benign. Her extremities are warm with no
edema and she is grossly neurologically intact.
Her first set of labs at the Ha Ottejaquesrence Hospital
revealed the following: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 ,
CO2 24 , BUN 40 , creatinine 2.5 , glucose 95 , white blood cell
count of 10.16 , a hemoglobin of 10.0 , platelets 232 , INR 1.5.
Her BNP was 2138. Her lipase was 7. Her troponin level was
0.75.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
Non-ST elevation acute myocardial infarction. On presentation ,
the patient had several EKG changes consistent with an acute
coronary syndrome. She was in normal sinus rhythm with T wave
flattening or inversion in leads V4 to V6 and in the inferior
leads also 2 , 3 , aVF. She had Q-S complexes in V1 through V3.
She was deemed to be a high-risk patient for the TIMI score of
5and they documented troponin leak. She was managed medically ,
not interventionally given her acute renal failure. She was
treated with unfractionated heparin with a PTT level of 50 to 70
seconds. She was given aspirin , Plavix. She was also given
eptifibatide intravenously for five days and is also treated with
beta blockers and ACE inhibitor. After five days , she had no
recurrent chest pain. Her EKG changes were persistent but her
troponin levels have trended downwards and she has really been
asymptomatic in this regard. Regarding her pulmonary edema , we
treated with Lasix initially 40 mg IV Lasix x1 and then on
standing PO Lasix 40 mg daily , and diuresed her and also gave her
morphine and oxygen. Within four or five days , her physical
examination was much better and her crackles and rales had
markedly decreased. On admission , she was saturating 96% on 3.5
L. She progressed. Her oxygen requirements decreased. She was
diuresed and was finally weaned off oxygen and is currently
saturating 97% on room air. The plan is for her to continue on
aspirin , Plavix , high-dose Lipitor , and beta-blocker , and
nitrates as needed.
2. In terms of her acute renal failure , based on the records
from the Trickvan Agi Health Network , her creatinine had jumped from
1.1 to 2.5 in three days. This was felt to be most likely due to
intrinsic renal failure. She did not have a low urine output and
she had received amikacin in the past few days prior to admission
as well as contrast dye and she did have a history of contrast
dye induced nephropathy leading to a predialysis state , although
she did not get dialysis on that occasion. Here , we simply
avoided nephrotoxic agents , were judicious in the use of Lasix
with strict ??____?? controls , and her creatinine gradually began
to decrease and today it is down to 1.6. Infectious Disease
wise , she came with the documented urinary tract infection
reported to be due to E. coli resistant to levofloxacin and
gentamicin. Here , we cultured her again and found E. coli more
than a 100 , 000 colonies , which was resistant to ampicillin ,
gentamicin , ciprofloxacin , and levofloxacin. It was sensitive to
ceftazidime and she therefore received renally dosed ceftazidime
for her UTI to complete a 7 to 10-day course. Blood cultures
drawn on the 24 of April showed no growth to date. The
patient has also been afebrile in with a white blood cell count
between 7 and 11 , 000. In terms of her hypertension , of note , it
has been difficult to measure her blood pressure , probably
measuring her blood pressure in her left arm by palpation is a
most reliable way to do this. She was treated here with
hydralazine , Lopressor , and diuretics. On discharge , she feels
well. Today , she told me that she has not filled this for a long
time. She had no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath.
She is afebrile with a temperature of 98. Her pulse ranges
between 60 and 70. Her blood pressure is between 102 and 150
systolic and she is satting 95% on room air. Her current weight
is 73 kg and she is deemed to be euvolemic so this should be her
target weight and she is ambulating with assistance. She is
alert and oriented x3 in no acute distress. She has got pupils
equal , round , and reactive to light. She has only a few
bibasilar crackles on bases. Otherwise , her lungs are clear.
Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm with no gallops , rubs , or
murmurs. Her abdomen is benign. Her extremities are warm. Her
right calf is quite tender to palpation. She has a documented
old DVT in her gastrocnemius vein. This is old and she has
probably got some postphlebitic syndrome and should be followed.
She is neurologically grossly intact.
Her laboratories at discharge include the following:
Sodium 139 , potassium 4.7 , her creatinine is 1.6 , BUN is 50 , her
white blood cell count is 11.01 , hematocrit 28.5 , hemoglobin 9.2 ,
and platelets 258 with an INR of 1.2.
Her medications at discharge include the following:
1. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg orally daily.
2. Ceftazidime 1 g IV q.24h. until August to complete a
7-day course.
3. Colace 100 mg orally twice a day in case of constipation.
4. Lasix 40 mg orally every 12 hours.
5. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously three times a day , while
the patient is bedridden.
6. Isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg orally three times a day.
7. Lopressor 37.5 mg orally three times a day with hold
parameters , hold if systolic blood pressure is less than 110 , or
a heart rate is less than 55.
8. Sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.
9. Vicodin one tablet every six hours in case of pain.
10. Risperidone 0.5 mg orally once a day.
11. Lipitor 80 mg orally once a day.
12. Plavix 75 mg orally once a day.
13. Celexa 20 mg orally once a day.
14. Esomeprazole 20 mg orally once a day.
15. Lantus 17 units subcutaneously every morning.
16. Novolog sliding scale.
DISPOSITION AND PLAN: The patient is to go to rehabilitation.
Things to do specifically include the following:
She should be diuresed with Lasix as needed to achieve a dry
weight goal of 72 kg. She should continue on ceftazidime for her
urinary tract infection until August and her calf pain -
DVT should be followed , one possibly to raise the Clevewill Ent Hospital as this may represent in a cold malignancy , for which she
may need to be worked up once the acute setting is over.
Studies performed at this hospital include the following:
A renal ultrasound as part of her workup for acute renal failure
reveal a right kidney with a size of 11.8 cm and apical cortical
cyst , left kidney 10.6 cm , and no hydronephrosis. The patient
also had a MIBI , SPECT of her heart , which revealed the
following:
The combined ??____?? ischemia plus scar during the stress were
moderately abnormal with a summed stress score of 9. Her rest LV
ejection fraction was 50%. The patient's PET CT test results
were normal and consistent with a small region of myocardial
ischemia in the septal area and also a focus of ischemia in the
OM territory. She had abnormal global LV systolic function and
these results demonstrated in interval progressing per her prior
study performed on November , 2004.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: INAPPROPRIATE SINUS PAUSE , ADMITTED FOR
PACEMAKER PLACEMENT.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2 ) STATUS POST PTCA OF RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY
( TIMES TWO ) IN 1992.
3 ) STATUS POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN
1992.
4 ) STATUS POST CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT
TIMES TWO VESSELS IN 1992.

THAN RIGHT CLAUDICATION.
6 ) DEPRESSION.
7 ) STATUS POST CHOLECYSTECTOMY.
8 ) STATUS POST PELVIC FLOOR SUSPENSION TIMES
TWO ( RECTOCELE AND CYSTOCELE ).
9 ) STATUS POST APPENDECTOMY.
10 ) HISTORY OF BOWEL OBSTRUCTION ( STATUS POST
PELVIC SURGERY WITH ADHESIONS ) TREATED
WITH LYSIS OF ADHESIONS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 61 year old female with
coronary artery disease ( status post
PTCA , myocardial infarction , and coronary artery bypass graft ) who
presented with a few week history of near syncope and evidence of
inappropriate sinus arrest on Holter monitor for pacemaker
placement. Ms. Debrecht 's pertinent medical history was significant
for longstanding peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery
disease. In early 1992 , she first noted the onset of exertional
chest discomfort. Symptoms progressed and an exercise tolerance
test was performed in 1/4 which was standard Bruce protocol at
six minutes and thirty seconds with a maximal heart rate of 160 and
maximal blood pressure of 144 stopping secondary to 2 to 2.5 mm ST
depression inferolaterally. Cardiac catheterization in 6/9
revealed left anterior descending of 80 to 90% and mid right
coronary artery 99% ( with left-to-right and right-to-right
collaterals ). The right coronary artery lesion was PTCA to a 20%
residual which re-occluded and was re-PTCA to a 20% then
re-occluded again ( no PTCA a third time ). Echo in 6/9 revealed
an ejection fraction of 50% , inferior hypokinesis consistent with
prior myocardial infarction , and mild MVP/MR was also seen.
Coronary artery bypass graft times two vessels ( LIMA to left
anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the proximal
descending artery ) was performed in 6/9 ( Dr. Nethery ). Since
then , she had done well with no further chest pain. Starting
approximately one month prior to admission , the patient began to
experience episodes of near syncope. Episodes consisted of the
sensation of light headedness , tunnel vision , tinnitus , and
diaphoresis ( although she felt near-syncopal , she had never
actually experienced true syncope ). During episodes , she
frequently felt the sensation of facial flushing with diaphoresis.
She could not recall precipitating events prior to the episodes but
did note that the events never occurred when she was active , only
when she was at rest ( but not asleep ). Holter monitor on September , 1996 revealed multiple three to four second pauses. The
patient's anti-hypertensive , metoprolol ( 25 mg b.i.d. ) was
discontinued , however , repeat Holter on 10/9/96 revealed multiple
pauses ( 114 pauses in a 24-hour period ) with the longest lasting
4.2 seconds. The patient was then sent to the Sa Ratee for further evaluation and management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As described in Secondary Diagnoses above.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Divorced , retired x-ray technician , former smoker
of one pack per day times thirty years quitting
eleven years ago , and history of ethanol consumption at the time of
divorce. Her primary medical doctor was Dr. Armand Shackelford
( Huban ).
FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a myocardial infarction at age 76
and history of hypercholesterolemia , mother died
at age 86 of gastrointestinal ulceration and had a history of
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , and sister with non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal ulcers.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: ASA 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. ( discontinued three weeks ago ) ,
vitamin supplements ( vitamin E , lysine , Co-Q10 , vitamin C , calcium ,
Centrum Silver , and primrose oil ) , and no over-the-counter
medications.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , Zantac , and Comtrex , all of which produce
angioedema and tetracycline ( sun sensitivity ).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs showed a blood pressure of
160/110 , pulse 92 , temperature 97.0 ,
respirations 16 , and 97% on room air. GENERAL: Energetic white
female in no apparent distress. HEENT: Extraocular movements
intact , pupils equally round and reactive to light , oropharynx
without erythema or exudate , and no cervical lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly. NECK: Supple and carotids 2+ bilaterally without
bruits. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm at 72 with no
rubs , gallops , or murmurs. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation and
percussion. ABDOMEN: Obese with cholecystectomy scar , chest tube
scars , and bowel surgery scar ( right just lateral of the midline ) ,
normal bowel sounds times four , non-tender , non-distended , no
hepatosplenomegaly , and no bruits. EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema , femoral pulses were barely palpable , and distal
pulses were 1+ bilaterally on the right and left lower extremity.
NEUROLOGICAL: Alert and oriented times three , cranial nerves
II-XII intact , strength 5/5 , sensory intact , deep tendon reflexes
3+ bilaterally throughout , and toes downgoing.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: SMA 7 was remarkable for a potassium of
3.9 , BUN 14 , creatinine 0.7 , liver
function tests within normal limits , white blood count equalled
7.8 , hematocrit equalled 41 , and platelets were 233. PT was 12.3
( 1.1 ) and PTT equalled 30.4. Chest x-ray showed status post
coronary artery bypass graft and bibasilar atelectasis but no acute
air space disease and EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 79 with
an axis of 60 degrees , T wave inversion in V2 to V3 with upright in
V4 and V6 , and Q waves in II , III , and F.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 61 year old female with peripheral
vascular disease and coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass graft now admitted for
evaluation and management of near syncope. Holter monitor had
demonstrated persistence of sinus pauses despite discontinuation of
beta blocker ( metoprolol ). The patient was admitted for
observation over the weekend. She experienced multiple sinus
pauses , particularly at nighttime. The longest pause recorded was
4.7 seconds. Though she was aware of the irregular heart rhythm ,
she never became truly syncopal or had evidence of hemodynamic
instability. She was enrolled in the ECTH trial and underwent
placement of a dual chamber pacemaker randomized to the VVIR mode on
9/10/96. She tolerated the procedure without complication. Post-operative
chest x-ray revealed appropriate location of atrial and ventricular leads and
no evidence of pneumothorax. Interrogation of the pacemaker
revealed appropriate response. The patient did well overnight and
was discharged on May , 1996 with instructions to follow-up
with Dr. Passarella in ten days.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged on May , 1996 in good
condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ASA 325 mg p.o. q.d. and Percocet one to
two tablets p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain.
FOLLOW-UP: She was instructed to follow-up with Dr. Lafranca on
August , 1996 at 1 p.m.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCT.
CONTRIBUTING DIAGNOSIS: HYPERTENSION , CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ,
DIABETES , SCHIZOPHRENIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67 year old black
female with a history of diabetes ,
hypertension , coronary artery disease , SVT and schizophrenia
presented with 45 minutes of substernal burning , shortness of
breath and diaphoresis. The patient has a long history of chest
pain which began in 1988 with her first rule out for MI. She has
had extensive cardiac workup including a recent ETT MIBI during
which she went 5 minutes 40 seconds with a maximum heart rate of
71 , blood pressure of 138/68 with no ST segment changes and no
evidence for ischemia. MIBI images: anteroapical defect on stress
images with reperfusion at rest consistent with ischemia. These
studies were done in October of 1992. The patient was thought to have
rate related ischemia which is induced by SVTs or other
precipitants that increase her heart rate. The patient has had no
substernal chest pressures since October of 1992. She experiences no
chest discomfort on exertion. She has had a good rate control on
Lopressor 75mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient presented in the Emergency
Room today complaining of epigastric burning in her chest 1 time a
week which awakened her from sleep at night. It is usually relieved
by Mylanta. On the day of admission , however , the patient
experienced a sudden onset of substernal chest burning without
radiation while lying in bed. She had eaten 1 hour before going to
bed. The pain was accompanied by palpitations , shortness of breath
and diaphoresis. She denied nausea and vomiting. It was not
relieved by Mylanta. The patient received a sublingual
nitroglycerin in the ambulance resulting in relief. The patient's
cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes , history of
tobacco use and hypercholesterolemia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As
above: Adult onset diabetes mellitus , hypertension , a left great
toe ingrown toe nail , diverticulosis , history of frequent nose
bleed , multiple right pinna ear infection , schizophrenia , history
of colonic polyps with guaiac positive stools in 1987 and a barium
enema the same year demonstrating colonic diverticula , degenerative
joint disease of the knees. MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission:
Verapamil SR 240mg p.o. q d , Naprosyn 375mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. ,
fluphenazine 35cc IM q 2 weeks , Ibuprofen 400mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Nitropatch , Lopressor 75mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH insulin 45 units
q.a.m. , Pepcid 20mg b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 1 tablet p.o. q
d , Librium 10mg p.o. b.i.d. ALLERGIES: The patient has no known
drug allergies. Family history includes a brother who died at 60 of
an MI , a sister who died at 71 of an MI. Social History: The
patient is a widow with 4 children , lives with grandson , a retired
factory seamstress who stopped smoking 25 years ago. She had smoked
a 1/2 pack a day for 5 years and has no history of ethanol usage.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a pleasant black female in no
apparent distress with a temperature of 98.2 ,
pulse of 100 , blood pressure 140/80 , respirations at 16. HEENT:
Pupils were equal , round , reactive to light. Oropharynx was clear.
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits. Lungs
were clear to auscultation. Heart: Heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with distant heart sounds and normal S1 , S2. Abdomen:
Abdomen was with normal bowel sounds , was soft , obese and
non-tender with a hyperpigmented patch centrally. EXTREMITIES:
Extremities are without edema or joint effusions. The left great
toe had hypertrophic toe nails , tender to palpation with an ingrown
toenail. Rectal was with guaiac positive stool. NEURO: Neuro exam
was grossly non-focal. Skin had no new rashes.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Admission data included a sodium of 144 ,
a potassium of 4 , chloride of 107 , bicarb
of 27 , BUN of 24 , creatinine of 1.1 , glucose of 155. CK was 430
with an MB fraction of 1.5 and as an aside , the patient is known to
have chronically elevated CKs. White count was 8.7 , hematocrit of
36 with an MCV of 90 and 93 , 000 platelets. PT 13 , PTT 30. LFTs
were within normal limits. EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at
95 beats per minute with intervals of .18 , .81 , .35 and axis of 21
with Q waves in V1 , V2 , T wave flattening in V2. Chest x-ray was
without infiltrates or effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospital course by system: The patient was ruled
out for MI , had CKs of 430 with an MB fraction of
1.544 with an MB fraction of 1.9 and 404 with an MB fraction of .8.
There were no further EKG changes. The patient had no chest pain
while in the hospital. The patient's Lopressor was increased to
75mg q.i.d. while in house and the patient also underwent a
diagnostic cardiac catheterization with the following results: An
LAD without critical stenosis , an OMB1 with a 90% proximal stenosis
and OMB2 with diffuse disease and serial lesions , an RCA with a
proximal 90% stenosis and a distal 70% stenosis , and normal
ventricular function. The patient was offered PTCA of her critical
lesions and the patient declined. As the patient had not been
compliant with her medical regimen , it was felt that we would send
her out on her increased dosage of Lopressor and monitor her level
of chest discomfort and perhaps re-offer her PTCA at a later date.
The patient's toe was evaluated by podiatry who felt that she had ,
in fact , an ingrown toenail which was treated via avulsion of the
margin of the nail and a 4 day course of Cephradine 500mg p.o.
q.i.d. The patient had all Ansaid held secondary to her guaiac
positive stool and her hematocrit monitored and it suggested that
the patient have a GI workup as an outpatient. The patient had
anemia which was thought secondary to chronic GI bleed. Iron
studies performed while in house detected an iron level of 31 ,
total iron binding capacity of 246 , a B12 of 904 , folate of 10.4 ,
and a ferritin of 235; all not consistent with iron deficiency
anemia. The patient also presented with thrombocytopenia which was
thought perhaps secondary to Pepcid or Ansaid. These medications
were held while she was in house and her platelet level remained
approximately 100 and was so upon discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient continued her normal medical regimen for
schizophrenia and was discharged in stable condition
on the following medicines: MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin
325mg a day , Librium 10mg b.i.d. , NPH insulin 42 units sub q
q.a.m. , Lopressor 100mg p.o. t.i.d. , verapamil SR 240mg p.o. q d ,
Prolixin Decanoate 12.5mg IM q o weekly and nitroglycerin 1/150 1
tablet sublingual q 5 minutes x 3 p.r.n. chest pain. The patient
will have home health aid and VNA services to ensure more
compliance with medication regimen and diet , also to check finger
stick glucose every day , blood pressure every week and to
administer her Prolixin every week. The patient is recommended to
be on a 800 ADA diet and will have follow-up with Dr.
in the CO Clinic.

Discharge Date: 11/2/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Trudell is a 69 year old woman
with a history of coronary artery
disease , status post an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in
January 1996. She had a cardiac catheterization at the time , which
showed an 80% mid left anterior descending artery lesion , and 80%
left circumflex lesion before OM1 , 50% proximal right coronary
artery lesion , and an 80% posterior left ventricular branch lesion.
She was also noted to have inferior and anterolateral HK with an
ejection fraction of 52%. The patient expressed her desire to be
managed conservatively , and was medically managed for the following
year. She had a sub-max exercise tolerance test prior to discharge
and one month later had a full BRUCE protocol going six minutes
with less than 1 mm ST segment depressions in several leads. The
patient did well for the past year without symptoms until 1:00 a.m.
on the morning of admission when she woke from sleep with
substernal chest pain. She took sublingual nitroglycerin with
relief after half and hour but at 3:00 a.m. the pain recurred with
nausea. The patient took two sublingual nitroglycerin with
resolution of the pain by 4:00 a.m. She presented to the emergency
department free of pain and electrocardiogram at the time showed
changes consistent with anterior ischemia. The patient was
admitted with unstable angina for evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include simvastatin 10 mg q.h.s. ,
sublingual nitroglycerin , enalapril
5 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: She had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pulse of 62 , regular and blood
pressure 160/80 , respiratory rate 12 , oxygen
saturation of 99% on three liters nasal cannula. There was no
evidence of jugular venous distention , carotids 2+ bilaterally , no
bruits. Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm and an S4 was
present. Abdomen was obese , soft , nontender and nondistended with
normal bowel sounds present. Extremities were without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission the patient's initial CK was 111.
Her second CK was 452 , with an MB fraction of
45.1 , third CK was 550 with an MB fraction of 47.9 , and a fourth CK
of 439 with MB fraction of 33.5 , fifth CK of 261 , with MB fraction
of 14.9 , and a sixth CK of 156. SMA seven was normal.
Troponin I was 0.0 on admission. White blood count of 11 ,
hematocrit 39.7. Chest x-ray was unremarkable for any infiltrate
or any congestive heart failure evidence. Electrocardiogram
revealed normal sinus rhythm at 75 , axis 0 , 2 to 3 ST segment
elevation in V1 through V3 , 1 mm elevation in V4 , less than 1 mm ST
segment depressions in 1 , AVL , and V5 , V6. These changes were new
compared to a previous electrocardiogram from January 1996.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to CCU , at which time
she was pain free and her electrocardiogram
abnormalities had resolved. Her heart rate and blood pressure were
controlled with intravenous medications and she was managed
medically until hospital day three when she was taken of the
cardiac catheterization laboratory. Cardiac catheterization
revealed a 90% plus left anterior descending artery lesion distal
to D1 with evidence of thrombus , 60% proximal left circumflex
lesion with diffuse disease in the OM1 , a 40% right coronary artery
lesion , left ventriculogram revealed anterior lateral apical and
septal HK and AK. The patient returned to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory the following day for PTCA and stenting
of her left anterior descending artery lesion followed by ReoPro
infusion. From the time of her admission to the Cardiac Care Unit
throughout her hospital stay the patient did not have recurrence of
her chest pain. Cardiac enzymes returned to baseline.
Electrocardiogram revealed ST segments also returned to baseline.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Include aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Ticlid 250
mg p.o. b.i.d. for 11 days , Atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enalapril
20 mg p.o. q.d. The patient is instructed to resume a low fat , low
cholesterol diet. Activity as tolerated.
FOLLOW-UP: With Dr. Kroell on 9/21/97 at 3:50 p.m. and will
also follow-up with Dr. Brendlinger in the end of August or
beginning of April , to be arranged.

Discharge Date: 11/19/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
OTHER PROBLEMS: 1. STATUS POST CHOLECYSTECTOMY
2. ASTHMA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 41 year old
Afro-American woman who has the
diagnosis of inferior wall myocardial infarction on 4/26/95
transferred from Rahert Hospital for postmyocardial infarction
angina.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Hypertension , smoking , family history of
coronary artery disease , and CVA. No
diabetes. She is not postmenopausal , no history of elevated
cholesterol. No previous myocardial infarction history.
Two and a half weeks prior to admission while sorting mail , she had
20 minutes of Cushing substernal chest pressure , increased
shortness of breath with diaphoresis and radiation down the left
arm and across to the right chest. Initially , she thought she had
gastrointestinal distress. Pain often appeared 1 to 2 hours after
eating , was not associated with exertion , and is questionable if
affected by position. There were no EKG changes. In the intervening
period she had several additional episodes of this pain and
presented to HMC where she was treated with Disalcid and Tagamet.
The pain persisted in a crescendo pattern until 4/26/95 when she
presented to LSSHA with a complaint of two days of unrelenting chest
pressure. She was sent to Ai Community Hospital where she ruled in for
myocardial infarction with a CK equal to 1508 MB fractions. MB of
126 with a peak of 1900 on 8/6 EKG demonstrated Q waves in 3 and
ADF. T waves aversions of 2 ST segment depressions in V2 through
V5. She was treated with IV nitroglycerin , heparin , oxygen ,
diltiazem , Metoprolol and aspirin. She apparently had additional
pain while on this regimen and was transferred to the Campte Hospital for catheterization and management.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications as an outpatient were only
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q day. Upon transfer her
medications included Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg once a
day , Diltiazem CD 240 mg once a day , Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d. , IV
nitroglycerin , IV heparin , and Percocet for pain.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies , but has an allergy to seafood
- she gets hives.
FAMILY HISTORY: As above. Coronary artery disease and
cerebrovascular accident in the early 40's in both
her father and mother.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She smokes one pack a day of cigarettes for the
past 20 years with occasional alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit at
the Mouth- Butlham Hospital is notable
for a blood pressure of 130/85 , the pulse is 79 , respiratory rate
of 16 to 20 on three liters of 100% face mask. HEENT exam -
sclerae are anicteric , pupils equal and reactive to light ,
extraocular movements are intact , oropharynx were clear. There were
no carotid bruits , jugular venous pressure at 6 cm flat. Chest -
there was a poorly healed scar on the anterior chest. Lungs were
clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. No CVA
tenderness. Cardiac exam - PMI nondisplaced , regular rate and
rhythm , normal S1 , split S2. There is a 2 out of 6 whooshing
crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the left upper sternal
border that radiates to the apex. There was an S4. Abdomen - obese
with a surgical scar in the right upper quadrant. No
hepatosplenomegaly. Femoral pulses are intact with a right bruit.
Extremities were without edema , symmetrical distal pulses.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal. Reflexes were intact. Toes were
downgoing bilaterally.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION: Notable for potassium of 3.8 , a white
blood cell count of 13.6 , hematocrit of
37.8 , platelets of 179 , magnesium 2.3 and CK of 201 , PT-PTT 13.2 ,
59 with an INR of 1.2. Urinalysis was notable for 25 to 30 white
blood cells , 5 to 10 red blood cells , 2+ squamous cells , 1+
leukocyte esterase. There were no effusions or evidence of failure
on chest x-ray.
HOSPITAL SUMMARY: On admission this is a 41 year old woman with
multiple cardiac risk factors who ruled in for
an inferior wall myocardial infarction and is now experiencing
postmyocardial infarction pain either secondary to current angina
versus pericarditis , although there was no EKG evidence to support
this. In the IH she was treated with heparin , beta blocker ,
aspirin. Calcium channel blocker was discontinued. IV
nitroglycerin was continued , oxygen. The patient was scheduled for
a catheterization of the heart the morning after transfer with
pretreatment of 60 mg of Prednisone x two for history of shellfish
allergy. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 10/12/95
with the results being right atrial filling pressure of 8 ,
pulmonary capillary weight pressure of 12. There was a third OM
( first large OM was noted to have a thrombus nonobstructive with
good distal flow. ) The remainder of the coronary arteries were
deemed normal. On the 7 of October , the patient was transferred
out of the Coronary Care Unit to the stepdown unit. Of note ,
postcatheterization femoral pulses were 1+ bilaterally with a bruit
on the right which was there prior to catheterization. An
echocardiogram done demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45 to 50%
with posterior hypokinesis and mild mitral regurgitation. On the
7 of October , the patient was noted to have a white blood cell
count of 20.7 at this time , PTT of 74.3. EKG was notable for T wave
inversions in 2-3-S , V2 through V6 which were seen on EKG's from
1/7 The patient's MI was felt to be consistent with a lesion
from the thrombus seen on catheterization. It was thought at this
time that the increased white blood cell count was most likely
secondary to the Prednisone given as pretreatment prior to
catheterization. The patient's does of Lopressor was increased to
75 mg four times a day to achieve a heart rate in the 60's. She was
continued on the stepdown unit on Heparin , IV nitroglycerin and
continued on cardiac monitor. On the 29 of July , the patient
had an episode of recurrent pain 3 out of 10 , radiating to the left
arm with no associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting , but slight
diaphoresis. At note , at this time , the IV nitroglycerin was being
weaned down. Her vital signs at this event were 130/90 with a pulse
of 80. Cardiac exam was notable for a normal S1 , S2 and S4 , no new
murmurs noted on exam. Lung was clear. EKG was notable to be a
sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 with T wave inversion and 3 and R
which were old , as well as ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2
which were old and suitable normalization in V6. She was given one
sublingual nitroglycerin and the IV nitroglycerin was dialed up.
She was likewise given 5 mg IV push of Lopressor for recontrol and
Serax 15 mg x one. Her chest pain was reduced to 2 out of 10 with
these interventions with no radiation in the arm. She described it
as a heaviness. Blood pressure was 144/87 , pulse was 74. EKG at
this point was notable for sinus rhythm at 75 , normal intervals. T
wave inversions in 3R ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2 , V3 , V5
with T wave sinusoidality and V6 T wave slightly inverted. IV
nitroglycerin was dialed up further , morphine 2 mg x 1 was divided
and oxygen two liters , nasal cannula was in place. Patient was
pain-free with these interventions and a second 5 mg IV Lopressor
was given for better late recontrol. Duration of total episode was
approximately 20 minutes. The pain-free EKG was notable for a rate
of 78 wit V5 T wave more upright than sinusoidal and V6 T wave
upright , else no change. The IV TNG was dialed up further for a
blood pressure of 129/76 and rate was now 70. A second bolus of IV
morphine was obtained at this time. CK and Isoenzymes were sent
and Cardiology attending was made aware. The patient was made NPO
in case of any need for catheterization the following morning if
symptoms were to recur. The CK following this event was magnified
with a triponin I of 14.1. On the 29 of July it was deemed
appropriate to continue with the IV heparin one more day and
control symptoms with IV nitroglycerin. if the symptoms were to
increase , it was still deemed appropriate to considering this
patient for recurrent cath. On the 20 of February , the patient
returned to catheterization which demonstrated a discrete 90%
distal left circumflex stenosis. There was a PTCA performed of this
distal stenosis which left a residual 60% stenosis. A stent was
placed in the distal stenosis to provide a 0% residual stenosis.
The lesion in the proximal circumflex developed a greater than 50%
stenosis during the procedure , and two stents were placed in the
proximal left circumflex to provide a 0% residual stenosis for a
total of three stents in place in the left circumflex. EKG's were
stable postcatheterization. There was no remarkable hematoma in the
right groin. CK postcatheterization was 64. On the 18 of November
the patient's Lopressor was changed to Atenolol and the patient was
started on Coumadin for the stents. The patient at this time on
6 of October had a heart rate in the 68 to 75 range with a
blood pressure of 120/75% , O2 sats were 99%. As the patient was
being coumadinized on the 18 of February , she had a
supertherapeutic response coumadinization with an INR of 5.7. The
plan was to recheck the INR to secure a downward trend as well as
to start planning for discharge. On the 24 of April , the INR
was 4.6 , demonstrating a downward trend with a subsequent maximum
INR , while supertherapeutic , of 6.5.
DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged home on June with
followup with Dr. Mathur and Dr. Stailey at the For Nali Hospital

Discharge Date: 3/16/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old female
with a history of lupus , hypertension ,
asthma , breast cancer status post mastectomy and chemotherapy ,
rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation who was found
pauses of up to 6.6 seconds on a Holter monitor and was admitted
for consideration of pacer placement. The patient states that over
the last several months since October , 2001 , she has noted
increasing dyspnea on exertion and decreased exercise tolerance.
She also has noticed episodes of palpitation. She presented to her
primary care physician in October , 2001 with these complaints. He
put a Holter monitor on her 10/1/01 which showed her to have
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rates between 67 and 214 with a
mean rate of 117 beats per minute. Her primary care physician , Dr.
Esmond , initially put the patient on digoxin and Coumadin. Her
rate remained elevated , however , so he changed the Coumadin to
Cardizem. About one month ago he also added propafenone 150 mg
p.o. t.i.d. On 10/5 she presented to her cardiologist , Dr.
Cowser , complaining of continued palpitations and ankle edema.
He stopped her Cardizem at that time as he felt that was what was
contributing to her lower extremity edema and placed her on
atenolol 25 mg p.o.q.d. instead. She had a leepy Holter monitor
placed from 8/29/23. Wednesday morning , her second day of
atenolol , she noted having episodes where ""I felt my heart pause
and then surge when it started to beat again"". This was associated
with lightheadedness x several seconds. She did not have any
associated chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea and vomiting ,
diaphoresis or syncope. She called Dr. Cedotal on 6/16 and he
told her to stop her atenolol and continue her propafenone. Over
the last two days she has had flutter episodes of irregular heart
beat but has had no lightheadedness since stopping the atenolol on
Wednesday. She has noted increased shortness of breath over the
last couple of days , as well , on climbing one flight of stairs.
She also has orthopnea using two pillows at night , does not have
PND , does have lower extremity edema. On the day of admission
which was 10/25/01 Dr. Mcferrin received a transmitted Holter recording
from Viewden Medical Center that showed the patient had normal sinus rhythm with
episodes of atrial fibrillation with high rates but also that she
had episodes of 6.6 second pauses. Thus , she called the patient
and had her sent via ambulance to the Cole General Health
emergency department for consideration of admission for pacemaker
placement. In the emergency department the patient's vitals were
she was afebrile with a pulse of 112 , blood pressure 150/81 ,
breathing 18 , satting 95% on room air. Her review of systems was
negative for fever , chills , or sweats , chest pain , syncope ,
abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria or rash. In
the emergency department she revealed 40 of IV Lasix and was sent
to the floor.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: She is a 52-year-old female
resting comfortably at 45 degrees , in no
acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal , round and reactive to light
and accommodation. Oropharynx revealed moist mucous membranes , no
erythema. Neck veins appeared to be around 10 cm. CHEST:
Wheezing bilaterally and crackles at both bases. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1S2 , did have an S4 and did have a
3/6 holosystolic murmur loudest at the apex to the axilla. She
also had a 1/6 diastolic decrescendo murmur at the left upper
sternal border. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , with good
bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Warm , well perfused. She did have 2+
lower extremity edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission. Sodium 146 , potassium 3.6 ,
chloride 117 , bicarb 19 , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 ,
glucose 120 , CK 76 , troponin 0 , CBC showed a white count of 8.73 ,
hematocrit 29.1 which was around her baseline. Her baseline had
been 30-38 on the last admission. Her platelets were 289. ESR was
75 which is what it had been in July . INR was 3.1
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular
redistribution. Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at
94 with a normal axis , normal intervals. She did have left atrial
enlargement as well as right atrial enlargement. Her last echo
done at MH on 10/13/01 showed an ejection fraction of 63% ,
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , LV systolic function
preserved , a thickened mitral valve , moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation plus left atrial enlargement , aortic valve thickened ,
mild AI , no AS. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation , moderately
increased pulmonary artery pressures , normal RV plus her atrial
enlargement and they made notes that the mitral regurgitation was
increased on this echo when compared with an echo done one year
prior at BKTMC .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Breast cancer status post left
mastectomy with lymph node dissection
in 5/1 Pathology revealed invasive
ductal carcinoma , grade 3/3 , node
negative. She is status post four
cycles of Adriamycin and cytoxan.
2. History of lupus x 21 years.
3. History of rheumatic heart disease.
4. History of hypertension.
5. History of asthma diagnosed three years
ago.
6. History of recent atrial fibrillation.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lisinopril 40 q.d.; prednisone 10 q.d.;
Coumadin 5 q.d.; Prevacid 30 q.d.;
chloroquine 100 q.d.; Plaquenil 200 b.i.d.; Lasix 20 q.d.;
albuterol inhaler p.r.n.; Flovent 220 2-3 puffs b.i.d.; Flonase
b.i.d.; propafenone 150 t.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Tetracycline which give her nausea and vomiting
and sometimes she got that with aspirin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a nurse currently on a medical leave of
absence. She lives alone. Tobacco history she
does smoke 1 pack per day since she was 23. No ethanol.
FAMILY HISTORY: Brother with sarcoid plus a history of
hypertension. Father with prostate cancer.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: From an ischemia standpoint
she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. We
did continue her antihypertensive regimen of lisinopril 40 q.d.
From a pump standpoint we felt that perhaps her mitral
regurgitation was the main cause of her 2-3 month history of
increasing dyspnea on exertion , exercise intolerance , and
increasing orthopnea. Thus , we got a repeat echo which showed
borderline left ventricular hypertrophy with an estimated ejection
fraction of 55% , normal RV. The mitral valve was moderately
thickened and rheumatic in appearance. The mitral valve area was
estimated at 1.3 cm squared although this may have an under
estimate. There is severe mitral regurgitation and moderate left
atrial enlargement. The aortic valve was calcified. There was
mild aortic insufficiency. There was mild tricuspid regurgitation
with a regurgitant velocity of 3.5 consistent with mild elevation
in pulmonary systolic pressures of approximately 48 mmHg plus right
atrial pressure. Given her severe and symptomatic mitral
regurgitation we then decided that she would likely benefit from a
mitral valve replacement. Then we proceeded to cardiac
catheterization. Her left heart catheterization showed a left
dominant system with clean coronary arteries. Her right heart
catheterization revealed elevated right ventricular and pulmonary
artery pressures and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of
31. She was diuresed several kg from her admission weight with IV
Lasix and she was continued on her ace inhibitor for afterload
reduction. Consultation with Dr. Mazingo of cardiothoracic surgery
was obtained and he felt that patient would indeed benefit greatly
from an MVR. Thus , plan was made for patient to be discharged home
and then to be readmitted electively when Dr. Brocks returned from
vacation for an MVR. From a rate and rhythm standpoint , the
patient was in normal sinus rhythm for the majority of her hospital
stay. We continued her propafenone and Coumadin for her history of
atrial fibrillation and she did have excellent rate control on
this. She had no further pauses on telemetry during hospital stay
and thus it was felt that given she was asymptomatic and did not
have any pauses off of beta blockade , that she did not need
pacemaker placement on this admission.
2 ) Pulmonary: From a pulmonary standpoint we felt that likely she
had cardiac asthma as with diuresis her wheezing and shortness of
breath was nearly 100% improved.
3 ) Rheumatology: From a rheumatologic standpoint her lupus was in
good control. She did not have of her typical lupus flare symptoms
such as arthralgias or rash , fever and , thus , we continued her on
her Plaquenil , her chloroquine and her prednisone.
4 ) Renal: She did not appear to have any renal involvement of her
lupus and her renal function was within normal limits throughout
her stay.
5 ) Heme: She had a normal cytic anemia at 29 which was within her
baseline range of 29-38. Full iron studies were sent and it was
felt that it was most likely consistent with anemia of chronic
disease.
6 ) Prophylaxis: From a prophylaxis standpoint she was on Coumadin
for atrial fibrillation so was not considered for heparin and she
was continued on Prilosec throughout her stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Plaquenil 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.; lisinopril 40
mg p.o.q.d.; magnesium gluconate 2 grams
p.o. b.i.d.; prednisone 10 mg p.o. q. a.m.; propafenone 225 mg p.o.
t.i.d.; Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.d.; K-Dur 60 mEq p.o.q.d.; Flovent 220
mg inhaled b.i.d.; Flonase 2 sprays nasally q.d. for her allergies
and postnasal drip; Prevacid 30 mg p.o.q.d.; chloroquine 100 mg
p.o.q.d.; Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
FOLLOWUP: She had an appointment to follow up with Dr. Flecther
in one week's time and to follow up with Dr. Druvenga in
two weeks' time when he returned from vacation. At that time would
then follow up with an elective admission for MVR.

Discharge Date: 3/30/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old Hispanic
female with insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus and hypertension , who fell at home approximately 1 week
before admission. She suffered a right-sided Colles fracture that
was treated with closed reduction and half cast. Furthermore , she
suffered a nondisplaced left-sided patella fracture , which was
primarily treated with a knee immobilizer. Since the follow-up
x-ray of the distal radius 1 week after trauma showed shortening
and dorsal angulation , the patient was admitted for closed
reduction and external fixation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY reveals
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , anxiety. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY reveals she is status post open reduction and
internal fixation of a left-sided tibial plateau fracture 9 months
ago. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Verapamil 80 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , Chlorthalidone 50 milligrams by mouth per day ,
humulin-N 40 units subcutaneously each morning , multivitamin 1
tablet by mouth per day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a 62 year old
female in no acute distress. Lungs were
clear. Cardiovascular examination showed regular rate and rhythm ,
III/VI holosystolic murmur , regular S1 and S2 , no S3 or S4. Abdomen
was soft , nontender , no palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities showed the right forearm and wrist immobilized in a
splint , there was regular VMF of all 5 digits , good capillary
refill , radial and ulnar pulses were 2+/2+. Left knee had positive
effusion , no signs of ligamentous instability , straight leg raising
possible , but with 15 to 20 degree extension deficit.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , x-ray of the left knee , PA
and lateral , shows nondislocated patella
fracture ( fracture line almost not visible ). Distal radius PA and
lateral showed shortening and dorsal angulation of the articulate
surface. On admission , electrolytes were within normal limits ,
blood urea nitrogen 23 , creatinine 1.3 , hemoglobin 13.0 , hematocrit
38.2 , white count 8 , 100 , platelet count 411 , 000 , prothrombin time
12.3 , partial thromboplastin time 23.4. Urinalysis was without
pathological findings.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 9 of February , the patient underwent closed reduction
and external fixation of her distal radial
fracture. The patient tolerated the procedure very well and the
postoperative course was without complications. Postoperative
x-ray control showed an optimal result with anatomical reduction of
the radial articulate surface. During the early postoperative
course , the radial ramus of the radial nerve seemed to be
irritated , but recovered without any further intervention and the
patient was without any neurological deficit from the 4th
postoperative day on. While the left leg was immobilized with a
brace , the patient started to ambulate with a platform walker and
with full weight-bearing on the left leg. Prior to discharge , the
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. Serial electrolytes ,
blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were within normal limits.
Leukocytes were 8 , 000 , hemoglobin 12.9 , hematocrit 38.0 , platelet
count 489 , 000 , last blood glucose level prior to discharge from
7:00 am was 169 , 4:00 pm 73 , 10:00 pm 230. The pin sites on the
right forearm were without signs of infection. X-ray control done
on 13 of August , showed unchanged positioning of the right radius , as
well as the left patella.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE are the same as on
admission. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable. The
patient is going home. The plan is for postoperative FOLLOW-UP in
1 week at the Orthopaedic Clinic of Wyckbastroit Center .
Until then , the patient is advised to keep the right arm elevated
and to seek medical attention in case of fever , reddening of the
pin sites , and/or secretion from any pin site. Hence , the patient
is not able to do her finger sticks for blood sugar measurement by
herself , and Visiting Nurse Association was ordered.

ATTENDING: ALFRED JUZA MD
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Johnathon Jamieson , M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Wizar is a 51-year-old man who
was recently admitted for repair of left pseudoaneurysm in his
groin. He was in home and doing fine after discharge from
Ea Naron Medical Center on 6/14/2003. One week later , he
noticed pus draining from his wound site. He was doing daily
dressing changes at home. He was seen in Dr. Hearston 's office on
6/2/2003 with only mild improvement. He was admitted from
clinic for more aggressive management. He has no history of
fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , constipation , or diarrhea. No
chest pain and no shortness of breath.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam , he was afebrile. Vital sings are
stable. He is 100% on room air. He had on the left , 2+ femoral ,
no DP , monophasic PT pulse with cold foot. On the right , TMA ,
warm foot , femoral 2+ , DP monophasic , PT monophasic. Wound site
with some erythema and drainage , nontender , no odor.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease status
post CABG , peripheral vascular disease status post aortobifemoral
bypass and status post femoropopliteal bypass , COPD , chronic
renal failure , and diabetes mellitus.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Repair of pseudoaneurysm.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg once a day; digoxin 0.125 mg once a
day; Zestril 2.5 mg once a day; Ultralente 14 mg q.a.m. , 4 mg
q.p.m.; Zocor 10 mg once a day; Toprol 25 mg once a day; Imdur 30
mg once a day; torsemide 100 mg once a day; and Dilaudid p.r.n.
ALLERGY: He has an allergy to penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: One pack a day smoker. Occasional alcohol.
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was admitted for IV
antibiotics and further surgical therapy with the diagnosis of
dehiscence of left thigh bypass graft wound. He received
wet-to-dry dressing changes t.i.d. initially. On 3/2/2003 , he
was taken to the operating room for left groin closure with flap
by Plastic Surgery and Vascular Surgery. The flap initially was
pink and viable , however , on 5/14/2003 , there were noted some
pale areas and mottling of the flap. He was injected with
heparin solution. Following this , flap received serial needle
pricks and the appearance gradually improved as such there was no
further pallor or mottling. The patient developed diarrhea. He
was on vancomycin , levofloxacin , with p.o. Flagyl for empiric
treatment for C. diff. C. diff cultures were negative on
10/16/2003 , in addition his drain cultures on 10/20/2003 , showed
rare Staphylococcus aureus. On 3/2/2003 , repeat culture of
the groin were negative. He had an episode of nausea , which
improved after Flagyl was discontinued. The patient was seen by
Cardiology during his stay here. On postoperative #2 , he was
noted to be volume overloaded. His torsemide was increased to
100 mg b.i.d. with goal diuresis of 1-2 liters per day. IV Lasix
was added p.r.n. to achieve this goal. After his episode of
nausea , his EKG was checked to rule out any sort of cardio
ischemic cause for this nausea , EKG was normal. His morphine was
discontinued as a possible cause. He did well with p.o. pain
medications. Renal: His Zestril was held secondary to an
elevation in creatinine to 3.3 from his baseline of 1.8. This
gradually resolved. Creatinine was 2.5 at the time of discharge.
The patient was also seen by the Nutrition and recommended
supplements , vitamin C , and Zinc for wound healing. By
10/16/2003 , the patient's flap was stable , pink , and viable. He
had lower extremity pulses that were Dopplerable. He was
discharged home in stable condition with services.
Discharge medications include enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg once
a day; digoxin 0.125 once a day; Ultralente 16 units q.a.m. , 4
units q.p.m.; Zocor 10 mg once a day; Toprol 25 mg once a day;
Imdur 30 mg once a day; torsemide 100 mg once a day; lisinopril
2.5 mg once a day; colace; and Percocet.

Discharge Date: 3/28/1993
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 53-year-old right
handed man who was admitted to the
neurology service on 1/10/92. He has a two week history of right
sided slowly improving. The neurology service felt that the
findings on exam was most consistent with cervical disc disease and
they asked neurosurgery to consult. In brief , the patient's chief
complaint is right sided weakness. The patient was in his usual
state of health until approximately three and a half weeks prior to
admission. He noted pain in his right shoulder over four to five
hours , the pain increased. He also noted numbness in his right
toes. His right hand was weak as well and he had difficulty
holding a cup. Conservative management failed , i.e. , bedrest. He
came to the emergency room at the request of his local doctor and
was admitted to the neurology service. While here , on Decadron ,
Motrin and Flexeril , he noted some improvement. Of note , he fell
flat on his face first on 10/21/92 and sustained a sprained ankle.
At that time , he had no back or neck pain. While in house , he felt
that he could walk three times around the Ingnorf At that point , he
experienced weakness and numbness on the fourth trip around. He
has also noted some urgency since the onset of his neck pain. He
has normal peroneal sensation except for the transient occurrences
of some saddle distribution of abnormal sensation. He has
constipation which has now improved. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: L4-5
laminectomy in 1970 and 1982. In 1980 , he had a perforated ulcer.
In 1982 , he had surgery for a hiatal hernia. In 1983 , he had a
cholecystectomy. In 1984 , he had a partial gastrectomy and
colectomy for swallowing a toothpick. He has a history of anxiety
attacks related to highway driving. He is a past smoker , stopped
seven years ago after three packs per day times 40 years. History
of alcohol abuse but does not drink now. He has no cardiac ,
respiratory or GI disturbances.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed the patient to be
afebrile. Vital signs were stable. General
exam was within normal limits. He had full range of motion with
increased pain with extension of his neck. He was alert and
oriented with a normal mental status. Speech was fluent with no
dysarthria. Cranial nerves were entirely within normal limits. He
had no pronator drift. On the left he was 5/5 throughout. On the
right he had 5- strength in his biceps , triceps , wrist extensors
and intrinsics. Hip flexors were 4/5. Knee flexors and knee
extensors were 4/5. He was essentially 5/5 throughout the rest of
his lower extremities. His reflexes were 1-2+ in his upper
extremities and approximately 3+ at the knees with downgoing toes.
He had 3-4 beat clonus on the right. Coordination was okay
bilaterally. Gait tested revealed a tendency to fall with
decreased ability to weight bear on the right. Sensory exam
revealed decreased sensation in the right hand and the last three
digits of the left hand. He had no subjective numbness in his
right leg , on the dorsum of his left foot , he had decreased
sensation with a cut off before the toes.
MRI was a poor quality study which showed C5-6 and C6-7 disc bulge.
CAT scan showed severe stenosis of C6-7 with osteophyte , moderate
stenosis at C5-6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen by Dr. Dubey who agreed
with the plan for C5-6 and C6-7 laminectomies.
He was taken to the operating room on 10/8/93. Preoperative
diagnosis with cervical stenosis with myelopathy. Postoperative
diagnosis was the same. The procedure was C4-5 , C5-6 , C6-7
laminectomy. He had a Hemovac placed postoperatively. The
estimated blood loss was less than 100 cc. Postoperatively , he did
very well. He had good upper extremity strength which seemed to
improve. He was seen by physical therapy. He had a slightly
swollen calf and had noninvasive vascular studies of his lower
extremities which were negative. He did , however , note some
shooting pain in his left lower extremity. His wound was clean and
healing well. He was out of bed with a walker. The plan was for
discharge home. He may need further evaluation of his lumbar spine
at some point but he seems to be doing well with Percocet only.

Hospital Course:
57 yo F with complex medical history here with mental status
change likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy with some component of
medication-induced delirium ( from opiates ).
++Mental Status - Avoided increasing narcotics. Given lactulose QID.
Mental status improved significantly in first 24 hours of
hospitalization. Patient then remained at her baseline mental status for
rest of hospital stay.
++MSK - Patient has history of chronic low back pain that is
likely related to bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures seen on MRI on
6/5/06. We avoided increasing her narcotic dose for concern of her
altered mental status. Pain was controlled effectively with MSIR prn ,
celecoxib daily prn ( should not increase to bid given ? increase risk of
cardiac side effects ) , and a lidoderm patch over her lower back. Other
NSAIDS were avoided given h/o GI bleed. Patient is scheduled to f/u with
Dr. Stayner ( Rheumatology ) for management of her back pain and
consideration of sacroplasty. Patient should be seen by PT at her nursing
home to help her with her walking.
++GI/ID - Had low-grade fevers overnight on HD 1 and 2. Patient had mild
RUQ tenderness which raised a question of possible GI / biliary source of
infection. Blood cultures were positive for coag negative staph in 2/4
bottles. She was treated with Ciprofloxacin and
Metronidazol starting on HD 1 , and vancomycin until speciation of blood
cultures. Blood cultures repeated on 11/18 and 7/27
were negative to date. Coag neg staph blood cultures were thought to be
due to contamination. Patient has remained afebrile and abdominal
tenderness has resolved over hospital stay. Vancomycin was discontinued
on HD 3 and Cipro and Flagyl were continued. She was discharged with
instructions to complete a 14-day course of Cipro and Flagyl. Her WBC
count and platelets decreased gradually throughout her hospital stay and
were 3.88 and 122 respectively. A CBC should be checked on Monday 6/25 to
make sure that she is not becoming neutropenic or thrombocytopenic.
++Pulm - The possibility of PE was considered given lower extremity
swelling and her change in mental status. Given that she was at her
baseline oxygen requirement and had negative LENIs , PE was thought to be
low probability. She remained at her baseline oxygen saturation ( 93-98%
on room air ) for the duration of her hospitalization. Given flovent for
known COPD.
++CV - EKG at admission was unchanged from previous EKGs. Patient's dose
of Lopressor was decreased , given her low BP at time of admission. Her
heart rate and blood pressure remained in the normal range throughout her
admission.
++Endo: MRI read from 3/8/06 showed evidence of osteoporosis. Started
caltrate , vit D. Unable to give fosamax because of history of esophageal
varices. Giving zometa x 1. Corrected calcium was normal. Will need to
re-check calcium in 1 week.
++FEN - Given thiamine , folate , fluids , Is/Os , weights.
++PPX - Lovenox , nexium , aspiration precautions.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You are being discharged from the hospital to your nursing home in
Smerfortn Blvd , Stin with a few changes in your medications. We have changed your pain
medication to MSIR every 4 hr as needed , celebrex , and lidoderm patch.
Please call your doctor if you are feeling that your thinking is not
clear or if you start to have fevers. And please return to the emergency
department if you are having increased abdominal pain , chest pain ,
difficulty breathing , or other concerning symptoms. You should have your
blood counts checked on Monday and your calcium checked next week.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Follow up with Dr. Vargas at next available appointment. Please call Dr.
Megeath office to schedule. Follow up with Dr. Blandin and Dr. Pfleider
as scheduled. Patient should be seen by physical therapy at her nursing
home. Patient should have a CBC drawn on Monday 6/25 to check her white
count and platements , which were trending down slowly throughout her
admission and recheck calcium ( corrected for albumin ) in one week.

and sodium restriction to patient. The patient was placed on
heparin preoperatively.
On hospital day #2 preoperatively , the patient was admitted to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit after she experienced a hypotensive
event with systolic blood pressure in the 50s with associated
drowsiness while maintaining her own airway. The feeling was that
the patient's event was likely secondary to the initiation of
Verapamil for rate control of her atrial fibrillation. The rate
control was then continued with Lopressor and Verapamil was held.
Goal potassium greater than 3.5 and magnesium greater than 2 were
maintained. The patient's diuresis was continued. The patient was
felt to be stable for surgery.
On hospital day #3 , 3/29/98 , the patient was brought to the
operating room for sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis , as
well as drainage of abscess. Postoperatively , the patient was
transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further
monitoring of her cardiopulmonary issues. Postoperatively , the
patient progressed well. She was maintained on perioperative
Vancomycin , Levofloxacin , and Flagyl. Cardiovascularly , she was
maintained on Lopressor , Nitropaste , Hydralazine , and Digoxin for
her atrial flutter. The patient did well on the floor , tolerating
IV to p.o. pain control , reinstitution of Coumadin for
anticoagulation , tolerating regular activity. Of note ,
the patient completed a rule out for myocardial infarction by
serial enzymes and ECGs. The patient was seen by the physical
therapy service and noted to have progressively improving activity.
The patient was discharged in stable condition.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to the Chemu Ford11 Memorial ,
a rehabilitation hospital. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Plaquenil 200 mg

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Chief Complaint: Left arm numbness and confusion
HPI: This is a 72 year old female with a history of DM and HTN who
was brought in by her family after transient sensation and confusion.
According to patient , while on her way back from her sleep apnea clinic
appointment , she felt a sudden pressure from her 'head down.' She had
been holding onto a strap on the bus with her left hand and suddenly
felt unable to hold on any longer and she felt tingling on her left arm.
While this was happening , she also became acutely confused and didn't
recognize her own neighborhood or even the house across from hers. She
was able to stand up and walk off of the bus as well as up five steps on
her front porch with assistance from the bus driver. By the time she
reached the front porch , 5 minutes after her symptoms started , she was
back to her normal self. At no time during this did she experience
headache , dizziness , vision/hearing changes , abnormal smell or nausea.
Her other extremities were not involved. She also never lost
consciousness.
ROS: positive for transient left arm tingling/numbness five times over
last three weeks but not associated with confusion.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: During this admission we evaluated your heart to make sure that it
was not the cause of your pain. In fact , your studies were improved from
your previous studies of yoru heart. It seems that your pain is likely
more due to your shoulder arthritis since the heart study we
performed was negative for blood flow problems to the heart. When you
have shoulder pain , you should try heat to the painful area ( or ice if
that helps more ) as well as Tylenol. You may also try ibuprofen in small
doses. Ibuprofen ( also known as Advil or Motrin ) is available in generic
form in your drugstore. It is not good for your stomach or your kidneys
so you should take only a very small amount as detailed in your discharge
summary. Because you had low blood sugar on admission to the hospital
we would like for you to take your diabetes pills only once a day
instead of twice a day until Dr. Daghita tells you differently.Your
medications are otherwise unchanged from your medications prior to your
admission. If you have weakness , shortness of breath , or
any other concerning symptoms you should seek medical attention
immediately.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Adjust pain medications for shoulder pain
2. Referral for physical therapy
3. Adjustment of oral hypoglycemics if FSBGs are high - oral agents have
been reduced to once daily as pt was hypoglycemic on admission

The patient is undergoing chemotherapy with Adriamycin and
cytoxan and is status post cycle 2 on 9/6/06 and began to
feel like she was recovering from her chemotherapy approximately
three days prior to admission. A spinal MRI obtained on Tuesday
to evaluate her spinal stenosis was uneventful but later on that
day the patient developed redness on the dorsum of her right hand
in the area in which her IV was placed per the MRI. The
following morning the patient had a pustular lesion on the fourth
digit of her right hand distal to the dorsal redness and went to
EH Urgent Care where she received one dose of ceftriaxone and
was given a p.o. script for Augmentin. She was sent home but at
home she developed expulsive diarrhea and vomiting on that
evening , was not able to tolerate her oral antibiotics. The next
day she noticed a similar lesion on the fourth digit of her left
hand looking much like that on the right hand. She returned to

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone in Te She has a
very sad social history in which her husband is a TX war
veteran and came back to the Ra and was service
connected with the pofield medical center of psychiatric
disturbances following his tour of duty. She has had three sons ,
two twins who died earlier in life of some unspecified heart
illness and a third son who died at the age of 21 after a long
hospital stay with clear cell sarcoma of bone. She lives alone
in a second floor walkup in Du near Inslareca Cou Pla She
has a distant history of tobacco 50 years ago. She rarely drinks
alcohol. Her friend and healthcare proxy is Ezekiel Stoviak , and
the phone # 288-186-2874.
FAMILY HISTORY: There is no history of breast cancer. Mother
had colon cancer. Three aunts and maternal grandmother also had
colon cancer. Her son had a clear cell sarcoma of bone.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ,
lightheadedness and dizziness associated with her chemo but she
denies fevers , chills , sweats in the past 72 to 96 hours prior to
admission. She did have chest pain on 3/28/06 two days after
her chemo but none since and in the time leading up to her
hospitalization.
ADMISISON PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature was 98.9 , pulse 98 , blood
pressure 132/55 , respiratory rate 16 , 95% on room air. The
patient's physical exam was significant for alopecia and obesity.
She was in no acute distress , alert and oriented. Her pupils
were equal , round and reactive. Conjunctivae were pink. She was
anicteric and her oropharynx was clear. JVP was hard to assess
due to neck fullness and she wears hearing aids. The lungs were
clear to auscultation except for decreased breath sounds with
crackles at the left base. Cardiovascular exam was regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 , S2 and no murmur , rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft and benign. Extremities had trace to 1+ edema.
The patient had an approximately 4 x 2 cm area of redness but no
swelling , positive warmth and positive tenderness on the dorsal
surface of her right hand. She had a pustular lesion on her left
fourth digit and right third digit that had been I&D in AH
Urgent Care.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs are significant for creatinine of 1 , white
blood cell count of 4.33 , hematocrit of 25.5 and platelets of
108. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a leftward axis and
first degree AV block. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is a 72-year-old woman with
stage III or stage IV breast cancer who now presents with
paronychia and possible cellulitis of her right and left hands.
Infectious Disease: The patient was initially started on IV
vancomycin given the proximity of her recent chemotherapy. Her
finger lesions and dorsal right hand lesions began to heal within
two days of her admission. She underwent incision and drainage
of her left hand's pustular lesion with improved speed of healing
and decreased pain. After 48 hours in the hospital the patient's
vancomycin was switched to Keflex at which time the patient
developed a area of redness on her left forearm that measured
approximately 6 cm x 4 cm in area. The lesion was notable for an
erythematous base with punctuate red lesions that did not appear
to be blanching. At the same time , she developed a very similar
lesion on her right index finger between her MCP and PIP. The
patient was switched back to IV vancomycin and the Infectious
Disease consultants were called to assist with the management of
the patient's evolving lesions. A TTE was obtained that showed no
vegetations and serial blood cultures showed no bacteremia. The
Infectious Disease consultants suggested that the patient had
paronychia in her digits with transfer of bacterial infestation
due to skin breakdown in the area around her nails on her hands.
The concern for septic emboli for which the patient was initially
treated became less likely in the setting of the new lesions that
were not in distribution that has been consistent with septic
emboli. 48 hours later the patient was again switched from
vancomycin to Keflex and within 12 hours developed new
maculopapular rash on her right neck and furuncles on her left
and right outer labia that were exquisitely painful. The patient
was given one more dose of IV vancomycin and then resumed on
Keflex. Dermatologists were consulted to help determine whether
the patient was suffering from shingles and they deemed that she
was not and that her new rash was likely eczematous in nature and
topical steroid creams were prescribed. The new rash on the
right neck quickly resolved and the furuncles on her labia were
symptomatically managed with sitz bath three times daily in
addition to her oral cephalosporin antibiotic.
Throughout the course of evolving dermatologic findings that the
patient experienced and the pain associated with them the patient
had continued to have absolutely no systemic complications
associated with these lesions. In particular , she did not have
fever at all during the course of her hospitalization , she did
not have chills or sweats , she developed no new heart murmurs ,
and her blood cultures remained negative throughout the course.
The patient was started on IV acyclovir when her new rash
developed and on the day of discharge was switched over to
Valtrex 1000 mg t.i.d. for management of presumed HSV infection
though cultures remained pending at the time of discharge. The
patient will be discharged on Keflex and Valtrex to complete a
course of ten days on each.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of type II diabetes , was
placed on a weight based insulin regimen with good effect during
the course of her hospitalization. On discharge , she will resume
her Lantus 40 units nightly.
Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of diastolic
dysfunction with a clean cath in 2005. Her aspirin , statin ,
Zestril , Cardizem , Lasix and nitrates were continued during the
course of her hospitalization in the same way that she takes them
at home with very well controlled blood pressures and no issues
with her rhythm.
The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea but does not
use CPAP and do not have any difficulties with her oxygenation
even while sleeping.
Heme: The patient was initially anemic and thrombocytopenic on
admission. She received one unit of packed red blood cells and
her hematocrit remained stable through the duration of her
hospitalization.
Oncology: The patient has ductal carcinoma and inflammatory
breast cancer that is likely stage IV and she is status post
cycle 2 of 16 of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Adriamycin and
cytoxan with a plan for surgical removal after her
chemotherapy.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home with VNA
services and physical therapy at home.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You have been admitted to the hospital with chest pain. Your chest pain
is likely due to a combination of your coronary artery disease and
anxiety. You did not have a heart attack. Rather this appears to be
stable angina and your current medication regimen is maximized for this
treatment. You also developed a fast heart rhythm called atrial flutter
when you were admitted , but your heart returned to normal rhythm on its
own. Thus , no medications are being started for this. As an
outpatient you will get an ECHO and also some heart monitoring that
will be arranged by Dr. Sapper You will be called with the times for
this. You should continue the same medications that you were previously
taking. If you develop light-headedness , chest pain , or shortness of
breath , you should call your doctor.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
*PCP - patient will need ECHO and Cardiac Monitoring as an outpatient.

Hospital Course:
62yo F with HTN , asthma and recent L total knee replacement
presented with extensive PE. She was extremely SOB and c/o pleuritic
chest pain. Her ekg and exam were not suggestive of cardiac
dysfunction. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient was initially
anticoagulated with Heparin. However , her platelets were noted to drop
from 237 to 93. HIT was suspected and Heparin was discontinued. The
patient was started on Fondaparinux. A PF4 Antibody was sent and pending
at the time of discharge. Coumadin was started after one day of
Fondaparinux with an intent to bridge over at least 5 days with a goal
INR of 2-3. The patient's blood pressure was decreased over the course of
her admission. All antihypertensives were held. She may be preload
dependent in the setting of an acute PE. During her admission an
echocardiogram was performed. It did not show evidence of right heart
strain or LV dysfunction. Her EF was 65-70%. Over the course of the
hospitalzation , the patient's symptoms improved dramatically. Her oxygen
requirement decreased. Her vital signs remained stable.
The patients respiratory status remained stable on home regiment
of inhalers and nebulizers PRN.
Ortho evaluated the patient while hospitalized and recommended weight
bearing as tolerated. The patient did not require narcotics for pain
associated with TKR.
Heparin products should be avoided. The PF4 antibody will need to be
followed by the PCP.

Discharge Date: 9/27/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old man with
ischemic cardiomyopathy , estimated EF
15-20% who presents with an 8-10 pound weight gain over the past
3-5 days , increased fatigue. Also reports increased shortness of
breath which has progressed over the past few months and notes that
he now gets shortness of breath after walking as few as 10-20
steps. He also complains of lightheadedness but denies chest pain ,
palpitations. He also complains of occasional sweats and chills
without nausea , diarrhea , constipation , melena , or bright red blood
per rectum. He reports that lately his blood sugars have been
lower than usual , in the 40s-80s. Denies orthopnea , PND , or lower
extremity edema. Denies dietary indiscretions or medical
noncompliance. However , there is a recent history of discontinuing
certain medications and the patient is unclear to which medications
he should actually be taking at this point.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction in 1979 and 1985 ,
status post three-vessel CABG in 1987 , ischemic cardiomyopathy ,
estimated ejection fraction 15-20% , cardiac cirrhosis ,
hypothyroidism , nephrolithiasis , gallstones , irritable bowel
syndrome , psoriasis.
ALLERGIES: He has no known allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Torsemide , Synthroid 100 mcg p.o.q.d.;
Lantus 98 units subcu q. a.m.; potassium
60 mEq p.o. b.i.d.; Humalog insulin 12 units subcu q. a.m. and q.
p.m.; Restoril 30 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Xanax p.r.n.; Prozac 40 mg p.o.
q. a.m.; Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.h.s.; digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.q.d.;
Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Aldactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. Per patient
his digoxin , Captopril and Aldactone have been on hold. Apparently
these were held after a clinic visit on 1/23/02 via Dr. Mcmeans
when the patient was complaining of orthostatic symptoms and his
torsemide was held over the past five days prior to admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 96.8 , heart rate
72 , blood pressure 91/63 , breathing 95% on
room air. GENERAL: This is a comfortable , pleasant gentleman in
no acute distress. Alert and oriented x 3. HEENT: Normocephalic ,
atraumatic. Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Moist mucous
membranes. NECK: JVP estimated at 12 cm/water. LUNGS: Decreased
breath sounds at bases , otherwise clear to auscultation.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal S1S2. Regular rate and rhythm. No heart
sounds. No murmurs , rubs or gallops appreciated. ABDOMEN: Soft ,
nontender , obese. EXTREMITIES: Warm , no clubbing , cyanosis or
edema. 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 1.2 , troponin-I 0.06.
Electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm at 67 beats/minute , first
degree AV block , left axis deviation , right bundle branch block. Q
waves in II , III and AVF consistent with old inferior infarct. All
these findings unchanged from the prior EKG in 2/14
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1. ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
3. VOLUME OVERLOAD.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
5. HYPOTHYROIDISM.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: The patient on admission was
clinically volume overloaded. He was diuresed
with torsemide IV boluses with good response. He was diuresing two
liters negative per day on torsemide IV or p.o. as well as
spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. However , his clinical volume status
were difficult to assess and accordingly on 8/12/02 he underwent
right heart catheterization and tailored therapy. By report his
right atrial pressure on right heart catheterization was 17 , his
wedge pressure was 43 and pulmonary artery pressure was 65/37
indicating that he still has substantial volume overload. On
therapy his vasodilators were cautiously added to decrease his
systemic vascular resistance and total vascular resistance with
success with low doses of Captopril. His PA catheter was
discontinued on 6/24/02. He has continued to be diuresed with
torsemide 10 p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. He should
be at or near euvolemia on 11/10/02 and he was discharged on a
diuretic regimen of torsemide 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. and spironolactone
25 mg p.o.q.d. in addition to Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
Ischemia: There were no ischemic issues during this hospital
admission.
Rhythm: Electrocardiogram with first degree AV block. The patient
was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospital course. No
evidence of significant arrhythmias were noted. No further workup
was pursued from a rhythm standpoint.
2 ) Endocrine: The patient had a history of hypothyroidism. It is
unclear how this came to be but at some point in the past his
Synthroid had been stopped and only relatively recently restarted.
He had been maintained at a dose of 225 mcg q.d. in the past. When
he was restarted on Synthroid by the outpatient endocrinologist ,
Dr. Escudero , his Synthroid was started at a relatively low dose and
titrated slowly upwards because of his severe cardiomyopathy and
there was concern that increasing his dose too quickly would
precipitate angina. On admission his TSH was 50 and after some
discussion with Dr. Pimpare his Synthroid was increased to 125 mcg
p.o.q.d. On 9/22/02 an endocrine consult was requested because on
7/30/02 his repeat TSH of 75.8 , T4 of 6.5 and a THBR of 1.10.
Endocrine consult recommended increasing Synthroid to 150 mcg
p.o.q.d. and slowly titrating Synthroid upwards by no more than 25
mcg q. 3-4 weeks to a goal of 200 mcg per day , again slowly
titrating upwards to reduce the risk of precipitating angina.
Further management of his hypothyroidism could be done on an
outpatient basis.
The patient also on admission had a history of Type II diabetes
maintained on insulin. His insulin doses had been titrated
downwards during his hospital diabetes mellitus because of low
fingersticks , likely secondary to a relatively healthy diet while
in the hospital. He required only 60 units of Lantus insulin q.
a.m. He was discharged on that dose with Humalog 10 units subcu q.
a.m. and q. p.m. to be followed and possibly titrated back upwards
by his outpatient endocrinologist , Dr. Wakeham
3 ) Psychiatric: The patient had a history of depression and
during this admission he was maintained on his outpatient
medications of Prozac and Restoril. His Prozac dose was titrated
upwards to 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. without any notable side effects. He
was discharged on this dose , 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. No further
psychiatric evaluation or interventions were required during his
inpatient stay. His mood remained stable during this admission.
4 ) Renal: The patient's creatinine was monitored throughout his
hospital course remaining relatively stable despite diuresis. No
further renal evaluation or intervention was required during this
hospital stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient was discharged on 11/10/02 on e
following medications: spironolactone 25
mg p.o.q.d.; Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; torsemide 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d.; simvastatin 80 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Lantus insulin 60 units
subcu q. a.m.; Humalog insulin 10 units subcu q. a.m. and q. p.m.;
K-Dur 40 mEq p.o.q.d.; Synthroid 150 mcg p.o.q.d.; Prozac 60 mg
p.o. q. a.m.; Restoril 30 mg p.o.q.d.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , ISCHEMIC
CARDIOMYOPATHY , DIABETES MELLITUS ,
HYPOTHYROIDISM , DEPRESSION.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , ISCHEMIC
CARDIOMYOPATHY , VOLUME OVERLOAD ,
HYPOTHYROIDISM , DIABETES MELLITUS , DEPRESSION.
CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition afebrile on 11/10/02 without
shortness of breath , without chest pain , without any complaints.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged home with VNA arranged to visit him
on 8/13/02 for the first time to monitor his weight ,
to monitor his electrolytes and to monitor his blood sugars and to
adjust his insulin and diuretic dose as needed.
FOLLOWUP: He was instructed to follow up with Dr. Edwardson in
1-3 weeks and to follow up with his outpatient
endocrinologist , Dr. Adelmund , in 1-2 weeks. Physical therapy was also
arranged for home physical therapy to begin after discharge.

Discharge Date: 4/14/1997
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: ( 1 ) UNSTABLE ANGINA
( 2 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
( 3 ) DIABETES MELLITUS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old female
with history of coronary artery
disease who presented with unstable angina. The patient's cardiac
risk factors include diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , and
post-menopausal. She presented to an outside hospital in 1992 with
substernal chest pain. A cardiac catheterization at that time
revealed an right coronary artery with diffuse disease , moderate to
severe proximal left anterior descending artery lesion at diagonal
1 , moderate mid- left anterior descending artery lesion , and a
tight left circumflex. She underwent a PTCA of the left circumflex
artery with improvement. She was well until approximately one year
ago when she began having exertional chest pain. Her chest pain
has been worsening over the past several months and has been
occurring with less and less exertion. She was admitted in July
of 1996 for chest pain and ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
An exercise Thallium test was negative. She was well until February
of 1997 when she again developed exertional chest pain. She said
that the chest pain was substernal. It had no radiation and no
nausea or vomiting and no diaphoresis. She had an exercise test on
10/15/97 where she was only able to exercise for three minutes and
stopped secondary to shortness of breath. She was scheduled for an
elective catheterization on 9/20/97 but her chest pain has been
slowly worsening over the past couple of months. She reports a
history of exertional chest pain at only one-half block. Normally
her chest pain was relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. On
the evening prior to admission she woke up at 3 a.m. with severe
substernal chest pain. She had no relief with three sublingual
nitroglycerin and , therefore , presented to the emergency room.
In the emergency room she was made pain-free with IV nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease as above. Diabetes
mellitus.
MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. qhs , and Metformin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the emergency room
department with chest pain but became pain-free
with sublingual nitroglycerin. The heparin was started in the
emergency room and the patient was given aspirin. The patient's
admission ECG demonstrated sinus bradycardia with no changes from
her previous ECG.
During the first several days of admission the patient began
complaining of some left chest pain but , on further questioning ,
the pain was under her left breast and radiating to her right back
and she was tender to palpation. Examination under the left breast
revealed three to four vesicles on an erythematous base felt to be
consistent with zoster. The patient was therefore started on
Famvir with some improvement of the pain and the lesion. In
addition to the superficial chest pain the patient did have some
chest pain which was felt to be cardiac in origin although she did
not have any ECG changes. She was continued on nitroglycerin and
heparin and her Lopressor was increased as tolerated.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on 5/26/97.
Although the final catheterization report is not available yet , the
catheterization showed three vessel disease with normal left
ventricular function. It was felt that the patient needed to go
for coronary artery bypass graft but , due to the fact that she had
the herpes zoster under her left breast , it was decided to wait to
do the coronary artery bypass graft until her zoster had improved.
Therefore the patient was discharged to home and will undergo
coronary artery bypass graft in several weeks. Prior to discharge
the patient was seen by surgery and anesthesia for her preoperative
workup. There were no complications.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH
26 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. , Lopressor 100
mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual q5m times three ,
Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets p.o. q4h p.r.n.
pain , Zocor 20 mg p.o. qhs , Famciclovir 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. times 7
days. FOLLOWUP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Alexis Iannotti
on 2/20/97 and will follow-up with cardiac surgery.
