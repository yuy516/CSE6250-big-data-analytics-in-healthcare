HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM/ PROBLEM:
Persistent pulmonary
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure. On 1/7/06 , shortly after
her admission to the medical floor , the patient was noted to be
in respiratory distress with tachypnea , accessory muscle use and
oxygen saturation of 68% on 6 liters nasal cannula. She was
placed on a nonrebreather. Her oxygen saturation increased to
93%; however , she continued to be in respiratory distress with
tachypnea and accessory muscle use. She was intubated and
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
evaluation and management. Her respiratory failure was thought
to be secondary to pneumonia with a component of superimposed
volume overload. She was treated with a 10-day course of
vancomycin , levofloxacin and ceftazidime as well as with IV
Lasix. She underwent a code green on 7/30/06 during an ETT tube
change , wherein a patent airway was transiently loss. The
patient was slow to wean from the ventilator. Her chest imaging
revealed persistent bilateral opacifications. It was thought
that after an initial infectious insult , the patient developed
ARDS. On 9/14/06 , the patient underwent bronchoscopy and BAL
revealing MRSA and HSV. The patient was treated with a 10-day
course of acyclovir for presumed HSV tracheobronchitis. Given
her inability to be weaned from the vent , the patient underwent a
tracheostomy on 4/17/06 .  Post-tracheostomy , the patient
alternated between pressure support ventilation with low driving
pressure and PEEP with a trach collar..
Infectious disease:
1. Fevers. From 1/7/06 to 7/28/06 , the patient was treated
with vancomycin , levofloxacin and ceftazidime for hospital
acquired pneumonia. After discontinuation of her antibiotics ,
the patient continued to spike fevers and evidence of
leukocytosis. In verification into source of her fevers included
serial blood cultures , urine cultures and C-dif. Positive data
included: 7/28/06 , urine culture with yeast , 7/28/06 , blood
culture with coag-negative staph , 9/14/06 BAL washings with HSV ,
9/14/06 , blood culture with coag-negative staph , 7/11/06 , blood
culture with coag-negative staph , 2/29/06 , urine culture with
yeast , 2/29/06 BAL washings with MRSA , 10/28/06 urine with yeast
urine with yeast , 10/28/06 , 6/23/06 , 4/17/06 , and 10/11/06
sputum with MRSA. 7/28/06 , chest CT with bilateral
opacification in the lung parenchyma. 2/29/06 facial CT with
left sphenoid maxillary thickening. 2/29/06 chest CT with
bilateral opacification in the lung parenchyma. Of note , a
2/29/06 abdominal CT showed no evidence of abdominal infection ,
2/29/06 TTE showed no obvious vegetations , and 10/11/06 tap of
the right knee grew no organisms. In light of the data above ,
the patient's indwelling catheters were changed. She underwent
treatment with linezolid x7 days for MRSA line infection. She
also underwent treatment with acyclovir x10 days for HSV
tracheobronchitis. The aforementioned antibiosis was mostly
prophylactic. It was thought that the patient's intermittent
fevers were not infectious , but rather reflected a drug allergy ,
most likely to vancomycin. This hypothesis was supported by a
robust eosinophilia coinciding with vancomycin administration.
Shortly after vancomycin discontinuation , the patient's fevers
resolved. The patient was afebrile for greater than 48 hours off
all antibiotics prior to transfer to rehabilitation.
Cardiovascular:
1. Volume status. The patient's admission weight was 106.2 kg.
It is unclear what her dry weight was. Given that pulmonary
edema was thought to be contributing to the patient's slow
ventilator wean , she was diuresed with a combination of Lasix and
Diuril followed by combinations of torsemide and Diuril. Her
discharge weight was 100.7 kilograms. Her diuretic regimen on
discharge with torsemide 100 mg IV t.i.d. and Diuril 500 mg IV
t.i.d. The patient's diuretic regimen will need be adjusted as
her intake is adjusted. Her creatinine will need to be monitored
very closely. Her weight will need to be checked daily.
2. Pump: The patient underwent echocardiogram on 11/19/06 ,
7/17/06 , and 2/29/06 .  On the whole , these studies revealed an
ejection fraction of 45-50% , concentric LVH , global hypokinesis
with regional variation , mild left atrial enlargement , mild
tricuspid regurgitation , a question of mild atrial stenosis , and
pulmonary artery pressures in the 40s. For her heart failure ,
the patient was treated with Lopressor and diuretics as above.
She was not started on an ACE inhibitor given her allergy
( cough ). She was started on low-dose ARB.
3. Ischemia: The patient has a history of coronary artery
disease status post three-vessel CABG and subsequent
single-vessel PPI. She has an RCA stenosis , 70-80% that has not
intervened upon. On admission , in the setting of respiratory
distress , the patient was in sinus tachycardia with rate related
to lateral ST depressions. Her cardiac biomarkers were positive
consistent with NSTEMI. It was thought that the patient
experienced demand ischemia rather than an acute plaque rupture.
On 10/8/06 , her troponin peaked at 8.53 , her CK at 275 , and her
MB of 16.3. The patient was treated with aspirin , Lopressor , and
Zocor. She was not started on an ACE inhibitor as detailed
above. She will likely warrant Cardiology followup with possible
RCA revascularization.
Neuro:
1. Sedation: While intubated , the patient was treated with IV
Versed and fentanyl titrated to light sedation. After her
tracheostomy , the patient's Versed and fentanyl drips were
discontinued. She was treated with Seroquel at bedtime to
preclude nighttime agitation. Her QTC should be monitored while
on Seroquel.
GI:
1. FEN: The patient initially received tube feeds via feeding
tube. She underwent a PEG placement on 4/17/06 .  She continued
on tube feeds. She also passed speech and Swallow and was thus
started on p.o. feeds with aspiration precautions. She also
received supplemental multivitamins , calcium carbonate , and
cholecalciferol. The patient will require speech and swallow
evaluation at rehabilitation. Now that she is awake , she may be
able to tolerate oral feeds with aspiration precautions.
2. Bowel regimen. The patient was treated with Colace , senna ,
and Dulcolax.
Heme:
1. Anemia: The patient has known iron deficiency anemia. She
was continued on iron and folate. She may benefit from an
outpatient colonoscopy if she has not had one recently.
2. Bleeding from tracheostomy site: On 4/24/06 , the patient
was noted to have bleeding from her tracheostomy site. She had
no hematocrit drop. She remained hemodynamically stable. She
underwent a bronchoscopy , which showed no active bleeding. Her
mild bleeding was thought to relate to suction trauma. Her
prophylactic heparin was held x1 day. It was thought that the
patient should be discharged on prophylactic heparin because her
DVT risk is so high. Should the patient have intense bleeding
from the tracheostomy site , a hematocrit drop or hemodynamic
changes. Her heparin subcu should be discontinued , her
hematocrit should be monitored closely , and she should be
transfused as needed. She should also at that point probably
undergo reevaluation by Pulmonary or Thoracics.
Endocrine:
1. Diabetes: The patient was treated with Lantus plus regular
insulin q. 6h. plus sliding scale insulin while she was on tube
feeds. Her insulin was changed on the night prior to discharge.
She was started on Lantus 100 subq b.i.d. She got her first dose
of 100 units subq on the evening prior to discharge , her morning
sugars were in the mid 100s. Her blood sugars should be followed
closely on the first one or two days at rehab. The blood sugars
should be monitored every 2-3 hours and her insulin should be
adjusted accordingly. Her insulin dose should be adjusted if her
tube feeds are cycled rather than given continuously or if she is
NPO.
Ortho:
1. Total knee replacement: The patient is status post right
total knee replacement on 8/19/06 .  Her right knee has a
well-healed incision and is not erythematous or tender. The
patient was initially on low-dose anticoagulation with Coumadin.
Her Coumadin was discontinued given her acute illness and her
need for procedures. She was treated with heparin subq
prophylactic doses 5000 units t.i.d. as described above. She
will need rehabilitation for her knee.
2. Prophylaxis: The patient was treated with subcutaneous
heparin and Nexium.
3. Access: The patient has peripheral IVs.
DISCHARGE STATUS:
On the day of discharge 3/8/06 , the patient was afebrile.
Heart rate was in the 80s , blood pressure was in the
100s-130s/60s-80s. Discharge weight was 100.7 kilograms. The
patient was drowsy , but arouseable. She was breathing on a trach
collar. She had decreased breath sounds at the bases. She had
an S1 and S2 with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the lower sternal
border. Her abdomen was soft and nontender with positive bowel
sounds. Her trach and PEG site were intact without any
surrounding erythema. Her extremities were warm without edema.
She was on trach collar with 50% FiO2 and oxygen saturation of
97%. Her discharge labs included a white blood cell count of 21 ,
stable , hematocrit of 28 , and platelets 436 , 000. Her chem-7
included a sodium of 131 , potassium 3 , chloride 87 , CO2 32 , BUN
67 , creatinine 0.8 , and glucose 154. Her LFTs were normal. Her
INR was 1.1. Her most recent microdata showed sputum with few
polys and a few gram-positive cocci in clusters. Her chest x-ray
showed a trach in place and bilateral hazy infiltrate consistent
with resolving ARDS.
An addendum will be given with discharge medications and doses.
At rehab , the patient's weight should be monitored daily. Her
blood sugars initially be monitored every 2-3 hours. After that ,
her blood sugar monitoring can be spaced out to t.i.d. or
whenever deemed appropriate by the physician at the
rehabilitation facility. Her hematocrit should be checked
particularly if she has any bleeding from her tracheostomy site;
otherwise , the hematocrit can be checked every day. The white
blood cell count should be monitored if the patient has any
fever. The creatinine should be monitored daily in light of the
patient's changing diuretic regimen. The patient in's and out's
should be monitored closely.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Borge is a 64-year-old gentleman with a previous history of
myocardial infarction x4 who presented to the Emergency
Department on 3/10/06 with shortness of breath and dyspnea on
exertion over the previous two months. The patient has known
coronary artery disease and has undergone multiple PTCAs and
balloon angioplasties in the past of his posterior descending branch
of his right coronary artery in 1996 , and stenting of his
posterior descending coronary artery in 2004 , also stenting of
his distal right coronary artery in 2005. While in the emergency
department , the patient had an episode of substernal chest
pressure radiating to his left jaw and left upper extremity. He
received sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine with relief. EKG
at that time revealed a right bundle-branch block with T-wave
inversions in the leads V2 , V3 , and slightly T-wave elevation in
leads II , III and aVF. On 1/5/06 , he underwent cardiac
catheterization , which revealed the following , posterior
descending coronary artery with an ostial 80% stenosis , right
coronary artery with a distal 60% stenosis , left circumflex
coronary artery with the proximal 60% stenosis , left anterior
descending coronary artery with an ostial 50% stenosis. Right
dominant circulation and right coronary artery had extensive
stenting with 50-60% focal areas of restenosis. Distal right
coronary artery stent before bifurcation has 80% stenosis.
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50% aortic
stenosis with a mean gradient of 41 mmHg and peak gradient of 60
mmHg , calculated valve area is 1 cm2 , mild aortic insufficiency ,
moderate mitral insufficiency , moderate tricuspid insufficiency ,
and mild pulmonic insufficiency. Carotid ultrasound revealed
right internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis , left
internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis. Pulmonary
function tests revealed FVC of 3.11 , 53% , and an FEV1 of 1.66 ,
35% predicted. Chest CT also performed on 5/29/06 revealed
cardiomegaly , massive calcifications involving the aortic valve
and coronary arteries , pleural thickening bilaterally , nodular
density measuring 7 mm in the lateral basal segment of the left
lung most likely represents round atelectasis or focal pleural
thickening , however , subpleural nodule cannot be excluded ,
recommending a repeat chest CT in six months after discharge , and
small ascites punctate calcifications in the pancreas.
PAST MEDICAL AND PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Significant for myocardial infarction , class II angina with
slight limitation of ordinary activity , class III heart failure
with marked limitation of physical activity , status post a PTCA
atherectomy and stent placement , hypertension ,

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Kreidler was brought to the operating room on 8/13/06 where
he underwent an elective aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm
Carpentier-Edwards magna valve and a coronary artery bypass graft
x2 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
coronary artery. Total bypass time was 164 minutes. Total
crossclamp time was 127 minutes. Intraoperatively , the patient
was found to have a calcified trileaflet valve functionally was a
bicuspid due to effusion between the left and right cusp ,
moderate adhesions in the left pleural space , requiring
adhesiolysis to harvest the mammary artery. Transesophageal
echocardiogram post-repair revealed normal function of the aortic
prosthetic valve and mild mitral regurgitation , with intermittent
heart block following bypass predominantly with A pacing. The
patient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass without
incident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus
rhythm and in stable condition. Please refer to dictation
number 4691426 for the immediate postoperative course. The
patient was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on 7/26/06 .  The
patient's mental status waxed and waned with confusion , initially
was with sitters in the Step-Down Unit , and also was in a
rate-controlled atrial fibrillation , with a good blood pressure ,
and tolerated increasing beta-blocker. The patient's mental
status improved , did well off sitters , and continue with
rate-controlled atrial fibrillation. Mr. Salser was placed on
Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation. Neurologically , he
remained intact , and was placed on levofloxacin and vancomycin
for H. flu and Staph pneumonia , which are both sensitive to
Bactrim , and started on a 5-day course of Bactrim twice a day.
He was cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day #9.

Discharge Date: 6/21/2003
Date of Discharge: 6/21/2003
ATTENDING: NOE DEMETRIUS MANDELLA MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Shortness of breath.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Pulmonary fibrosis.
2. Pulmonary hypertension.
3. Diverticulitis.
4. Acute renal failure.
5. Gout.
6. Hypertension.
7. High cholesterol.
8. Diabetes Mellitus.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-old
female with a past medical history of significant obesity ,
diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , heart failure ,
pulmonary fibrosis , on home O2 who presented with shortness of
breath , and left jaw pain on 8/10/2003 .  She had been in her
usual state of health until approximately 6 p.m. on the day of
admission , when at that time , she suddenly became short of
breath. She reports that she then sat down in her wheelchair and
""passed out."" However , it is unclear if the patient actually
lost consciousness. The patient also developed jaw pain
radiating to her back while EMTs were present and also complained
of a tug in her chest. The pain was unrelieved by nitroglycerin ,
oxygen; it was constant in nature. At the time of her arrival in
the emergency room , the patient was hemodynamically stable with
an O2 sat of 99% on room air. She was given sublingual nitrate
with no effect. Because of her history of coronary artery
disease , she was tried on heparin and aspirin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Pulmonary fibrosis , on home O2.
2. Reported history of an anterolateral MI.
3. Diabetes.
4. Hypertension.
5. High cholesterol.
MEDICATIONS: On admission , insulin 70/30 22 units q.a.m. 26
units q.p.m. , atenolol 25 q.d. , Zocor 20 q.d. , Zoloft 50 q.d. ,
Lasix 60 p.o. b.i.d. , Neurontin 100 t.i.d. , aspirin , and
multivitamin.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature was 97 , pulse
was 54-60 , blood pressure was 100-120/50-80 , and O2 sat was 98%
to 99% on 6 liters. She was a moderately obese woman in no acute
distress. Her lung are notable for crackles at the bases. Her
cardiac exam was notable for distant heart sounds with a normal
S1 , S2. She had no pedal edema in her extremities.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission were notable for a BUN and
creatinine of 31 and 1.1. Normal LFTs The patient's hematocrit
was 38. Her D-dimer was 736.
Her EKG showed normal sinus at low voltages , poor R-wave
progression.
IMPRESSION: At the time of admission , the patient was a
62-year-old female with morbid obesity and chronic episodes of
shortness of breath , this time accompanied by jaw pain and with a
history of coronary artery disease and multiple risk factors
concerning for acute coronary syndrome. The patient was
initially treated for a possible ischemic event. Diagnosis of PE
results were considered. However , the patient was not
tachycardic. She did not have any chest pain or new O2
requirements and had had several workups for pulmonary embolism
during prior hospitalization with similar systems , so therefore ,
this was thought to be less likely.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By system:
CARDIAC. In terms of ischemia , the patient had 3 tests of
cardiac enzymes , which returned negative. She was maintained on
telemetry , and she had EKG checked , which did not reveal any
changes. This was a patient who had a dobutamine MIBI , which was
negative for any evidence of ischemic changes. During the MIBI ,
there was no evidence of ischemia and/or scar. The patient was
continued on her outpatient medications including aspirin , Zocor ,
and atenolol. However , at a later point in her hospitalization ,
she became hypotensive at which time her atenolol was temporarily
DC'd , but this was restarted prior to discharge. In terms of the
patient's cardiac function , she has a history of CHF and is on
Lasix as an outpatient. An echocardiogram was repeated during
this hospitalization , which was notable for an EF of 60% ,
trace-to-mild MR , moderate TR , and estimated pulmonary systolic
pressure at 70 mmHg. The patient was continued on outpatient
Lasix regimen until at a later point during this hospitalization ,
the patient became hypertensive with acute renal failure at which
time her Lasix was discontinued. Lasix was restarted prior to
discharge. In terms of the patient's rhythm , she had no evidence
of arrhythmias monitored throughout her hospitalization.
GI. On 10/10/2003 , the patient developed acute onset of diarrhea
and lower abdominal pain. Now , this pain was nonradiating ,
alternating sharp and dull but constant , associated with nausea
and vomiting , and frequent stools. At times , the stools were
notable for bright red blood. The patient was therefore started
on levofloxacin and Flagyl as treatment for diverticulitis versus
ischemic colitis. To further evaluate this , a CT scan of the
abdomen was done , which was notable for a thickened colon for 10
cm at the hepatic flexure. Given this information , it was the GI
consult's opinion that this is most likely consistent with
diverticulitis , and the plan was to treat it aggressively with
antibiotics , and once the symptoms resolved , recommended a
colonoscopy several weeks after discharge. The patient was
continued on levofloxacin and Flagyl , but then , several days
later , became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the
80s. At this time , the patient's antibiotic coverage was changed
to include Ceptaz and vancomycin , and she also received 1 dose of
gentamicin. By the time of discharge , the patient's abdominal
symptoms have completely resolved. She is no longer having any
abdominal pain , and she needs no longer having any diarrhea and
is tolerating a regular diet without any difficulties. The plan
is for her to have a followup colonoscopy as an outpatient.
PULMONARY: The patient was admitted for shortness of breath. A
differential diagnosis at that time included chronic pulmonary
embolism versus cardiac etiology versus deconditioning in the
setting of a chronic pulmonary fibrosis. To establish that the
patient did not have any PE , she had lower extremity Doppler
exams , which were negative. She also had a PT protocol CT , which
was negative for any evidence of clots. Because the patient does
have cardiopulmonary hypertension , she was started on Coumadin as
prophylaxis for any thrombosis in the setting of her low flow in
her pulmonary vasculature. Throughout this hospitalization , she
was continued on her own home regimen of O2.
RENAL: The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency with
a baseline creatinine at 1.4 during this hospitalization at a
time that her diarrhea was very severe , and when her blood
pressures fell in the 80s , the patient developed acute renal
failure with a peak creatinine of 2.4 with decreased urine
output. The thought of the team was that this represented a
renal failure in the setting of her diarrhea , fluid losses , and
hypertension. Her pheno was consistent with this at 0.71. She
was treated with aggressive IV fluids. She also had a renal
ultrasound , which was normal. She did have 1 day of hematuria ,
which was thought to be due most likely to Foley trauma , which
resolved at the time of discharge.
ID: The patient's hospital course was notable for a diarrhea as
mentioned in GI. She was initially treated with levofloxacin and
Flagyl and then when she became hypertensive was then change her
Flagyl , Ceptaz , and vancomycin with 1 dose of gentamicin. Her
symptoms dramatically improved on these antibiotics on 9/18 she
was changed from IV antibiotics to a p.o. regimen of Flagyl and
levofloxacin. The plan is for her to continue a total of 14 days
of antibiotics. I anticipate the last day of antibiotic coverage
will be 2/19/2003 .
RHEUMATOLOGY: On 10/27/2003 , the patient was noted to have left
knee pain and was noted to have some focal lateral patellar
tenderness and swelling. A knee aspirate was performed and urate
crystals were identified , and the patient was diagnosed with
gout. Because of her chronic renal insufficiency and diarrhea ,
the decision was made to treat her gout flare with steroids , and
she is currently is on a steroid taper as treatment.
ENDOCRINE: The patient has a history of diabetes. She takes
70/30 insulin at home. She was initially continued on an
outpatient regimen; however , when she started to begin having
massive diarrhea , she was taken off her long-acting insulin ,
because she was not taking anything by p.o. At this time , she
was not tolerating a regular diet , and her insulin requirements
were increasing. It is recommended that as an outpatient , she
resumes one-half of her regular outpatient insulin dose for 1 or
2 days to ensure that her insulin requirements in her diet are
appropriate , and then , she should resume her regular insulin
dosage.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Include aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zoloft 50 mg
p.o. q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. ,
prednisone taper - which involves 10 mg of prednisone on 8/14
followed by 5 mg of prednisone on 10/27 , 1/24 , and 3/1 and
then stop , Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. , insulin 70/30 11 units
q.a.m. 13 units q.p.m. - once it is established that the patient
has returned to her regular diet , this dosage should be doubled
to her outpatient regular dose , and Flexeril 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.
DISPOSITION: The patient has been discharged to a rehab
facility.
FOLLOWUP: The patient is to follow up with her primary care
physician , Dr. Hargus following discharge.
ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Antibiotics should be continued until
2/19/2003 .  The patient should have her INR checked in 3 days.
Her goal INR is 2. Once off levofloxacin , her dose of Coumadin
may need to be adjusted.
2. The patient should have an outpatient colonoscopy and treated
for a week to further assess for diverticulitis.
3. Fingerstick blood glucoses should be followed regularly as
the patient's insulin dose is titrated up to her previous
outpatient dose.

noted anaphylaxis on previous discharge summaries.
2. Theophylline causes tongue swelling.
3. Quinine reaction unclear.
4. Iodine/IV contrast. This is noted in the medical record.
However , the patient does not remember having an adverse reaction
or allergic reaction to IV contrast.
5. Iron , this reaction is unknown.
6. Erythromycin , again , the patient does not remember any
reaction , but apparently has hives.
7. Levofloxacin , unclear what the reaction is. She has
tolerated this in April , which she was treated for a foot
ulcer. It is not clear if this is a rash or it was thought to be
possibly related to a fever that the patient had , but it is not
clear what the actual reaction is.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient is an 80-pack-year smoker. He is currently smoking.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
Her temperature was 99 , her pulse was 98 , her blood pressure was
105/55. Her respiratory rate was 18 when she was saturating 94%
on room air. In general , she is in no acute distress. Her HEENT
exam was unremarkable. Her cardiac exam was regular rate and
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Her lung exam was
notable for crackles most prominent in the left lower lobe. Her
abdomen was soft , obese , nontender and nondistended with good
bowel sounds. Her extremities were significant for erythema of
the left shin without warmth or tenderness. She also had a small
1.5 cm ulceration on the bottom of her left foot which has been
present for sometime although she says that it looks better than
at first. There was no purulence or purulent drainage from the
wound. Her neurologic exam was unremarkable.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:
Her labs were notable for a creatinine of 1.6 , a white count of
4.1 , with 11% eosinophils. Her hematocrit was 31.6 , and her
albumin was 3.
PROCEDURES:
Cardiac catheterization: it was done by Dr. Eeds .
FINDINGS:
Showed a right dominant circulation. There were no significant
left main lesions identified. The LAD had a tubular 90% lesion
and the diagonal I had a proximal tubular 60% lesion , there was
also a diffuse 80% lesion of the proximal circumflex. The RCA
had a proximal 75% lesion with a mid diffuse 60% lesion and a PLV
tubular 70% lesion. The coronary artery bypass grafts had a
patent LIMA to LAD graft , the SVG to marginal I had a 100% lesion
during this catheterization due to the moderate amount of
contrast and the patient's chronic kidney disease , they treated
the RCA and placed a 3 x 24 mm Taxus stent
ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
On 7/9/07 , showed an estimated ejection fraction of 50% with
inferoseptal and inferior severe hypokinesis. The RV was normal.
There was mild aortic stenosis. Mild-to-moderate aortic
regurgitation. The valve area was 1.2 cm2. There was mild
mitral regurgitation. There is trace tricuspid regurgitation
with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 36 mm plus right
atrial pressure.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: The patient was admitted because they had deep T
wave inversions in the lateral leads and are still concerning for
anginal equivalence of nausea and vomiting. It was decided on
admission that an echocardiogram would be performed and if there
was evidence of any regional wall motion abnormalities that she
would be taken directly to cath. The echocardiogram as noted
above showed inferior hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery
disease. She was taken to the cath lab on 9/5/07 and they show
two ____ that one of the bypass grafts was completely occluded
and was not visualized. They also saw that there was a proximal
RCA lesion 60% which was found to account for the inferior
hypokinesis given the right arm circulation. This was stented
with a Taxus stent. Because of her kidney insufficiency , it was
decided not to pursue the 80% left circ lesion and this was
deferred until later point as this was not thought to be causing
any problems. Her post cath ECG was unchanged and continued to
have the deep lateral T wave inversions. She did not complain of
any chest pain or nausea and vomiting during her admission. She
was started on aspirin and Plavix initially although as noted
below she did have an apparent allergy to Plavix and thus was
switched to ticlopidine 250 mg b.i.d. instead of Plavix for
anticoagulation. She was also continued Lipitor 80 mg daily ,
Lopressor 25 mg t.i.d. After her cath , it was originally planned
that she would go back to cath for intervention on the left
circulation lesion , however , given her other medical problems and
her relative stability hemodynamically and symptomatically , it
was decided that they would wait and decide later if this lesion
needed to be corrected in the future or not.
b. Pump: The patient had no significant issues with her blood
pressure here. She remained in a blood pressure range of 100-120
throughout her stay. She was continued on her beta blocker as
noted above. However , at discharge , this was switched back to
atenolol as her home medications and she refused to change
medications , she said that she would not be able to afford new
prescription. We did increase her dose of atenolol to 25 mg
b.i.d. from 25 mg daily as her requirement of beta blockade
seemed to be higher than what her home dose was. Given that she
has a concurrent renal disease , it would probably be useful for
her to be on an ace inhibitor ARB as well. This medication
should be added as an outpatient , if her blood pressure tolerates
it. It was on the lower side here , so we did not add it. We did
not diurese her in fact we held her Lasix on admission because
she seemed to be volume depleted given that she was admitted with
a lot of diarrhea , this again will need to be reconsidered if she
had increased edema. This can be restarted.
C: Rhythm: The patient was kept on telemetry , however , there
were no significant episodes of arrhythmias during her admission.
2. GI: The patient was admitted with persistent nausea and
diarrhea from Tlmamuthes Medical Center .  The diarrhea resolved one day
after admission. Her fecal leukocytes were positive but her C.
diff was negative. It was unclear what the etiology of this
diarrhea was and we were going to send a repeat stool study ,
however , she did not have any diarrhea afterwards and this may be
antibiotics associated diarrhea but it seemed to resolve
spontaneously.
3. Pulmonary: The patient was admitted with crackles in the
left lower lobe and some wheezing consistent with COPD and
pneumonia. A chest x-ray on admission showed a right lower lobe
infiltrate/atelectasis. We initially continued her on Augmentin ,
which she was taking for her diabetic foot ulcer. However , she
did not appear to clinically respond to this medication. We held
her antibiotics as noted below in the ID section and after that
her white blood cell count increased and she produced some
purulent sputum and Gram-negative rods. The Gram-negative rods
were later speciated as serratia although this information is not
available at the time of her discharge. She was treated for a
hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftazidime to
complete a 14-day course. Clinically , she appeared to improve on
this regimen , although her white count was still elevated at 15
on discharge , however , given her overall clinical stability , the
lack of fevers and the lack of systemic symptoms. We felt
comfortable with discharging her with close follow up.
4. Infectious disease: The patient was initially admitted on
Augmentin for a diabetic foot ulcer , the notes from Grantnas Healthcare by the Infectious Disease Service recommended a 2-4 week
course of Augmentin for her diabetic foot ulcer. She had
completed three weeks of therapy and thus we discontinued this
medication as it did not seem that there was really any evidence
of active infection in her foot. After holding the antibiotics
for three days , her white count began to rise and she developed a
purulent cough as noted above , this was thought to be a
hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was treated with vancomycin and
ceftazidime and she will complete a 14-day course of these
antibiotics.
5. Endocrine: The patient was home on oral hypoglycemics. She
was switched to coverage with an insulin scale. Her sugars were
relatively well controlled and she did not require much in the
way of supplemental insulin.
6. Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease. Her baseline
creatinine was 1.5-1.6. She was admitted and had a cath. She
was given Mucomyst and bicarbonated fluids for renal protection
during her dilute. Because of the risk for kidneys , the cath was
done with a little amount of dye as possible. Her creatinine
remained stable throughout her admission and settled out at 1.6
of her creatinine which is the baseline.
ALLERGY:
During the patient's admission , it was noted that she developed a
rash on 4/15/06 .  She was seen by the Allergy and Immunology
Service at the request of the cath lab given that there was
concern that she had this rash because of her Plavix. They felt
that this was possible. This was the most likely etiology and in
conjunction with her high eosinophil count it was felt that this
was a drug reaction to the Plavix. She was switched to
ticlopidine 250 mg b.i.d. and her rash appeared to improve. She
was also given claritin as well as put on a brief prednisone
taper given her diffuse rash and her brisk eosinophilia. She
should follow up with Allergy and Immunology in about one month
to see if the rash has resolved and potentially to try
rechallenge with Plavix at that point.
Cellulitis/diabetic foot ulcer: The patient has had a
longstanding diabetic foot ulcer which has been treated by wound
care VNA and was treated at Tha Hospital .  We continued the
Augmentin to a total course of three weeks and then stopped it.
We continued her dressing changes and this will be followed by
the VNA at home. There was no evidence of active infection ,
there was no purulence or erythema around the area of the ulcer
and the erythema around the foot appeared to be stable , this was
most likely chronic venous stasis change and not a true
cellulitis as there was no warmth or tenderness in this region.
CONSULTANTS:
Allergy/Immunology , the attending was Dr. Frija .
PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISCHARGE:
The patient was afebrile. Her pulse was 86 , her blood pressure
was 120/60 , her respiratory rate was 20. She was 92-96% on room
air. In general , she was in no acute distress. Her JVP was
about 7 cm. She had small amount of crackles at bilateral bases.
Her cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and
S2. There was a 2/6 systolic murmur most prominent at the left
lower sternal border. Her abdomen is soft , nontender , and
nondistended with good bowel sounds. She had 1+ edema
bilaterally with small amounts of erythema at the distal end of
the left lower extremity which has been stable. There is no
associated warmth or tenderness. She did have a 1.5 cm small
ulcer on the ventral aspect of her left foot , which did not have
any purulence associated with it. Her neurologic exam was
nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:
Notable for a creatinine of 1.5 , a white blood cell count of
15.89 , with 82.7% neutrophils , 3.8% eosinophils. Her hematocrit
was 28.6. Her baseline appears to be around 30.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Ticlopidine 250 mg by mouth twice a day.
2. Atenolol 25 mg by mouth b.i.d.
3. Lipitor 80 mg daily.
4. Prednisone taper 30 mg on 10/18/07 , 20 mg on 10/3/07 , 10 mg
on 10/18/07 and then stop.
5. Vancomycin 1 g IV daily , course to be completed on 1/16/07 .
6. Ceftazidime 1 g daily to be complete on 1/16/07 .
7. Allopurinol 100 mg daily.
8. Neurontin 300 mg three times a day.
9. Tessalon perles as needed.
10. Ativan 0.5 mg at bedtime as needed for sleep.
11. Glipizide 2.5 mg daily.
12. DuoNeb every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath.
13. Lasix 30 mg by mouth daily.
14. Aspirin 81 mg daily.
DISPOSITION:
Home with services.
PENDING TESTS:
As noted , the patient had a sputum culture that was growing
Gram-negative rods at the time of discharge. The current report
is that it was growing Serratia marcescens which should be staph
sensitive to ceftazidime , which he was prescribed for a total of
14 days.
FOLLOW UP:
She will follow up with Dr. Antony Baldonado on 10/12/07 at 9:30
a.m. She has an appointment scheduled.
TO DO LIST:
1. The patient has an 80% left circumflex lesion which was not
stented. This should be , ___28.20__ , whether she needs a second
intervention in the future. She does appear to be asymptomatic ,
but she does continue to have the deep lateral T wave inversion
suggesting the areas of abnormal blood flow in the heart. It was
thought that the right RCA lesion was more likely to be the cause
of her inferior wall hypokinesis , so that was the procedure
performed.
2. The patient was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with
vancomycin and ceftazidime. This will continue until 1/16/07 .
She was noted to have a rash here which was thought to be Plavix
related. If the rash resolves on ticlopidine , she may need to
readdress whether or not this was actually due to Plavix. It was
recommended that she follow up with an allergist in about a month
from her hospitalization who can review the records and determine
whether she should start Plavix or maintain on the ticlopidine.
3. Her platelets should be monitored given that she started on
ticlopidine and there is a risk of TTP associated with this
medication.

Discharge Date: 2/12/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: CHIEF COMPLAINT was a 57 year old man
who was status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty times 2 , of a left anterior
descending stenosis for unstable angina , and was admitted for new
onset of angina at rest. The patient's cardiac risk factors
included family history , borderline high cholesterol. The patient
had no prior cardiac history , until 12 of June , when he had substernal
chest pain with exertion. He eventually had cardiac
catheterization which showed an 80% proximal left anterior
descending lesion with thrombosis , good left ventricular function.
The patient had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to
this lesion. He was without symptoms for about 4 weeks , and then
in 23 of August , the patient noted new onset chest pain and left arm
numbness at rest. An electrocardiogram at that time showed sinus
bradycardia at 50 , T-wave inversions in II with flat T-waves in
III , and was otherwise unremarkable. He had an exercise tolerance
test at the time and went on a 9-minute standard Bruce protocol and
stopped secondary to fatigue. The electrocardiogram showed 3 to 4
millimeter ST depressions in the lateral leads , which was highly
predictive of coronary artery disease. At that time , he was repeat
cardiac catheterization which showed a restenosis of his left
anterior descending lesion. He had a repeat percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of the lesion without
complications. The patient did well for several weeks and was
pain-free. However , 6 days prior to admission , the patient began
to note occasional episodes of left arm numbness , which was always
relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. There was no accompanying
dizziness , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis. The patient at first had
2 or 3 episodes a day , now increased to 7 or 8 times a day at the
time of admission. On the day of adimssion , the patient had almost
constant chest pain and arm pain which lasted almost all day , only
partially relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient was
very concerned about the pain , and now comes to Tes Healthcare for further evaluation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY included
arthritis , kidney stones , chronic lower back pain. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION were Lopressor 25 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
aspirin 325 milligrams by mouth per day , Isordil 10 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day. ALLERGIES included no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the patient was a retired firefighter ,
occasional red wine , no tobacco use. His brother had 3 myocardial
infarctions in the past , no other FAMILY HISTORY.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile , pulse 54 , blood
pressure 104/70 , respirations 20. There was
no jugular venous distention. Chest was clear. Cardiac
examination showed regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no
peripheral edema. Extremities had good pulses bilaterally in
dorsalis pedis , posterior tibial and femoral.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Admitting laboratory values were
remarkable for potassium 4.3 , creatinine
1.0 , hematocrit 40.8. The electrocardiogram showed sinus
bradycardia at 50 , normal intervals , flat T-waves in AVF , V2 and
V3 , QRS axis 0 degrees. Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or
effusions , no evidence of congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on a rule out myocardial
infarction protocol. He had no elevations in his
serum creatinine kinase levels. The patient continued to have
intermittent left arm numbness during his hospital stay. For this
reason , he was taken back for cardiac catheterization , which showed
a 75% proximal left anterior descending lesion believed to be at
the same site as his previous percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty procedures. The patient had successful percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of the lesion with a 25% residual
stenosis. The patient postoperatively had no further episodes of
chest pain or arm numbness. He had no complications related to the
cardiac catheterization itself. The patient was then discharged.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE will be Lopressor 25 milligrams by mouth
twice a day , Ecotrin 1 tablet by mouth per day , diltiazem 60
milligrams by mouth twice a day. The patient was to FOLLOW-UP with
his cardiologist in 1 week.

ATTENDING: REILL , LAZARO MD
GILM COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery
disease , chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin , pulmonary
hypertension , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism
who presented in 5/25 with an apparent perforated appendicitis
for which she was taken to the operating room. Final pathology
during this procedure was serositis. Her postoperative course
was complicated by severe delirium , atrial fibrillation ,
abdominal abscesses requiring IR drainage in 10/10 and 10/7 .
The patient began having recurrent UTI , decreased appetite and
hematochezia at this time. On 8/17/05 , a CT of the abdomen
showed evidence of a colovesical fistula and the patient was
admitted to the Ore Of for further management.
On admission , she was found to be in acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 2.3 apparently secondary to dehydration after
recently having been started on Lasix for hypertension by her
primary care physician.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Pulmonary hypertension.
3. Chronic atrial fibrillation , on Coumadin.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Asthma.
6. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
7. Hypothyroidism.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Appendectomy in 5/25 .
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Atrovent b.i.d.
2. Metaxalone 2.5 mg daily.
3. Lipitor 10 mg daily.
4. Lasix 60 mg daily.
5. Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
6. Diltiazem 120 mg daily.
7. Potassium chloride 10 mg b.i.d.
8. Colace 100 mg t.i.d.

12. Wellbutrin 100 mg daily.
13. Protonix 40 mg daily.
14. Coumadin.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the Anorwin Hospital .  Her creatinine
improved with IV hydration on 3/25/05 .  She was taken to the
operating room for exploratory laparotomy , cystoscopy with
bilateral urinary stent placement , sigmoid colectomy with primary
anastomosis and diverting ileostomy. During the surgery , she
became hypotensive requiring pressors due to inability to replace
IV fluid adequately. She was transferred to the surgical
intensive care unit , intubated on pressors. For the first
several days , she had a inflammatory response-type picture with
significant vasodilation requiring pressors and massive IV
resuscitation greater than 30 liters of fluid. Sedation was
slowly weaned as the patient's respiratory status improved. Due
to a question of responsiveness during the first several days , a
head CT was performed which showed no evidence of stroke. She
became slowly more responsive as sedation was weaned with the use
of Precedex and was extubated on 1/22/05 , postoperative day 7
without complications. Her mental status in the intensive care
unit continued to improve. The remainder of the patient's
hospital course will be dictated via systems.
Neurologically , at the time of transfer out of the ICU , the
patient was noted to have subtly improving mental status. Her
family described her at baseline. During her stay on the floor ,
her Zyprexa dose was decreased. She had no further neurologic
issues.
Cardiovascular: In the intensive care unit , the patient required
vasopressin initially and was weaned off during the first three
or four days. Her chronic atrial fibrillation continued. She
was transferred out of the intensive care unit on IV Lopressor
which was gradually converted to p.o. as she tolerated a regular
diet. She was discharged on 100 mg q.i.d. of Lopressor.
Respiratory: In the intensive care unit , she was noted to have
respiratory failure initially secondary to a SIRS picture and
fluid overload. This significantly improved with diuresis. She
was transferred out on a nasal cannula. On the floor , she had no
respiratory issues. She continued her aggressive chest physical
therapy and was out of bed with physical therapist.
GI: In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient was noted to have a
postoperative ileus. She did not tolerate NG tube feeds. A post
pyloric Dobhoff was eventually placed and tube feeds were
initiated. After transfer out of the intensive care unit , the
patient had difficulty with her Dobhoff catheter and eventually
became clogged and had to be removed. A speech and swallow
evaluation was obtained. A bedside swallow was equivocal and a
fiberoptic swallow was done. She passed this with fine colors
per the speech and swallow team and they recommended that her
diet be advanced as tolerated. She was discharged to
rehabilitation on a regular diet.
GU: In the Intensive Care Unit , she was massively resuscitated
initially and then diuresed for virtually the remainder of her
hospital course. An initial Lasix drip was then changed to IV
Lasix boluses. She was discharged on p.o. Lasix at an equivalent
dose to her standing Lasix during her hospitalization. A
cystogram was obtained prior to her discharge to rehab at the
time of dictation. The result of the cystogram are not
available. If no extravasation is noted , her Foley catheter can
be removed at rehabilitation. If extravasation is noted , she
will need to undergo a repeat cystogram at some point in the
future prior to removal of her Foley catheter.
Heme: The patient was initially on subcu heparin due to concern
for bleeding. She was then started on a heparin drip and was
discovered that she had bilateral lower extremity partial DVTs.
Her heparin drip was titrated to a PTT of 60 to 80 prior to
discharge to rehab. Her heparin was discontinued and she was
started on Lovenox as a bridge to coumadinization. Her Coumadin
began during the few days prior to her discharge when she was
tolerating p.o. intake.
ID: Due to the colovesical fistula , concern for some liver
opacities on her original abdominal CTs , she was placed on
broad-spectrum antibiotics perioperatively. All antibiotics were
removed on 1/22/05 .  She was noted to have a candidal UTI ,
completed a five-day course of fluconazole. A small fever in the
Intensive Care Unit warranted blood cultures being sent and
repeat blood cultures on 10/4/05 eventually noted a
gram-positive cocci. It was felt that this was likely due to a
contaminant as the patient by that time had been afebrile for
several days. However , she was started on vancomycin for
gram-positive cocci , bacteremia. Her central line was removed
and a new central line was placed and she was discharged to rehab
on day 9 of 14 of IV vancomycin via her central line. After the
completion of this course of therapy , her central line may be
removed at rehabilitation.
Wound: Due to some drainage from abdominal wound due to her fat
necrosis , the lower portion of the wound was opened. There was
no evidence of active infection noted and a Vac sponge was placed
initially on 10/4/05 to facilitate the healing process. The Vac
was changed every three days during her stay. This most recent
change was on 10/30/05 .

DIAGNOSIS: OSTEOARTHRITIS LEFT HIP.
STATUS POST OSTEOTOMY FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS
OF THE RIGHT HIP.
HISTORY OF SLEEP APNEA.
OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: LEFT TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT BY DR. KOBA ON
22 of April .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46 year old male with
left hip pain , now worsening over the
past year , unrelieved with conservative therapy. The patient has a
history of congenital dysplasia of the hip , which was treated with
osteotomy of the right hip in 1988 , with good improvement. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY was also remarkable for sleep apnea. ALLERGIES
included intravenous pyelogram dye and shrimp. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION were none.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese white male in no
acute distress. He ambulated with a truncal
lurch to the left. Head and neck were within normal limits. Lungs
were clear. Cardiac examination was regular. Abdomen was obese ,
but benign. The left hip was remarkable for being 3/4 inch longer
than the right leg. Flexion was limited to 90 degrees , with 10
degrees lacking full extension. External rotation was 30 degrees ,
internal rotation 0 , abduction 30 degrees with increased pain , and
adduction 20 degrees. The patient's neurovascular examination was
within normal limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 22 of April , and
underwent left total hip replacement which he
tolerated well. Estimated blood loss was 400 cc. The patient was
in stable condition for the entire hospital stay. His immediate
postoperative hematocrit was 36.3. The patient was febrile for the
first postoperative day , but rapidly defervesced on perioperative
antibiotics with Ancef. On postoperative day #2 , hematocrit had
dropped to 29 and the patient received 2 units of autologous blood ,
which increased his hematocrit to 36. The patient remained stable
over 30 for the rest of his hospital course.
The incision was examined on postoperative day #1 , and was found to
be clean and dry. The patient started physical therapy on
postoperative day #1 , and made rapid progress. The patient was
anticoagulated with Coumadin for a prothrombin time in the range of
14 to 16 , and stabilized at a dose of 8 milligrams per night. At
the last dose , his prothrombin time had gone up over 16 and he was
changed to Coumadin 5 milligrams by mouth at hour of sleep. The
patient was cleared by the Physical Therapy Service and cleared
medically for discharge home on postoperative day #6.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. The patient
is to FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Mcfadden in 5 weeks.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE included Coumadin for a full 6-week
course , Percocet as needed. The patient will FOLLOW-UP with the
Coumadin Program through this hospital. The patient had no
problems with his breathing and will require no special therapy at
this time. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was good.

Discharge Date: 1/22/2005
ATTENDING: NAVAS , ROBT MD
DISPOSITION: Short-term rehab.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: MSSA bacteremia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 87-year-old man with a
history of bioprosthetic aortic valve , status post PPM and ICD
placement , who is transferred from Ties The Whiash County Hospital for workup
of bacteremia and concern for sepsis and endocarditis with early
evidence of multiorgan failure. He is 13 years' status post
bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and also has a history of
afib with diastolic heart failure and a permanent pacemaker , on
Coumadin therapy. Ten days prior to admission to the Josesanderstlake Medical ,
he had extraction of all his remaining teeth. Following that , he
had a gradual onset of malaise , shortness of breath , and general
weakness. He was admitted to Sonbyrd Lanor Community Hospital following a
fall to the ground where he was found to be febrile with
leukocytosis and there was a question of left lower lobe
infiltrate. Blood cultures at Kimau Hospital Of quickly returned positive
with Staphylococcus aureus. PE was performed , which was negative
for vegetation , but the patient's oxygen requirement increased
and his blood pressure seemed to be dropping , and thus he was
transferred to Lo Memorial Hospital for further workup and management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Afib , hypertension , diastolic dysfunction ,
echo in 1999 with moderate concentric LVH and EF of 65% , right
heart catheterization in 2000 showed elevated right heart filling
pressures and wedge pressure which increased with exercise ,
cardiac output of 4.4 , status post 27-mm bioprosthetic AVR and
ascending two grafts in 1992 , afib with diastolic heart failure ,
left bundle-branch block , permanent pacemaker , hypothyroidism ,
type II diabetes , obesity , distant cholecystectomy , AAA , status
post repair ( ? ) , thrombocytopenia , gout , prostate cancer , status
post hormone therapy , and diabetes mellitus.
MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission were lisinopril 5 q.o.d. ,
allopurinol 100 b.i.d. , glyburide 6.25 q. day , levothyroxine 100 ,
Zoloft 50 , Protonix 40 , Lasix 60 , and Coumadin 2.5.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his daughter who is very
supportive and his wife in Ver He is retired. No
history of tobacco or alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam , the patient appeared ill. He was
slightly lethargic. Slightly uncomfortable. His oxygen was 96%
on 4 L of oxygen. Heart rate 70s. Blood pressure in the low
80s. Temperature 99.1. HEENT: Notable for slightly elevated
JVP. His lungs showed decreased breath sounds at the left and
right base with rales up to one-third on the right side. His PMI
was nondisplaced. He was in an irregular S1 , normal S2 with no
rubs or gallops. There was a 1/6 systolic murmur at the base.
JVP was approximately 15 cm. Pulses were 2+ and equal
bilaterally. No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. He was oriented
to person , time , and generally to place , but not to date. His
remainder of neurological exam was grossly intact.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Notable for a potassium of 4.3 , BUN 36 ,
creatinine 2.5 , white count 8.1 , hematocrit 39.4 , CK and
troponins were negative , and INR 2.0. Chest x-ray on admission
showed a question of a left lower lobe infiltrate by report. It
also revealed a left pleural effusion with a question of
infiltrate and a right pleural effusion. EKG showed afib , left
axis deviation , and left bundle-branch block. Echo done at the
bedside shows an EF of approximately 45% to 50% without gross
regional wall motion abnormalities with some paradoxical motion
consistent with left bundle-branch block. There is no obvious
vegetation , but this was a limited study.
HOSPITAL COURSE AND PLAN PER SYSTEM:
Shortly after admission to the Cardiology Team , the patient
continued to have borderline blood pressures. His blood cultures
again grew out MSSA and his oxygen requirement increased and he
was transferred to the CCU for central monitoring and further
supportive care. In the CCU , he was continued on antibiotics.
Initially , the patient was on vancomycin for concern for MRSA.
When his cultures came back , he was switched over initially to
Ancef and gentamicin and then on consultation with ID to
nafcillin. The patient briefly required pressors , but then after
receiving IV fluids and continued antibiotics , his blood pressure
normalized to approximately 90 to 100.
Remainder of hospital course by system:
1. ID: The patient had repeated Gram-positive bacteremia with
MSSA up until the January , 2005 , after which time his daily
cultures have shown no growth to date. As above , the patient
will be maintained on nafcillin , gentamicin was discontinued , and
the patient was started in rifampin on 5/24/05 , both antibiotics
which he should continue for at least 4 to 6 weeks. Daily blood
cultures do not need to be resumed unless the patient has a
temperature at which point he should be cultured. He has been
afebrile for the last 3 to 4 days prior to discharge. We did not
do a TEE as the patient is likely not a surgical candidate and he
was felt to be at very high risk of intubation , should he become
septic again or spike temperatures this would be reconsidered.
In the interim , the patient should continue with antibiotics and
follow up with ID Clinic in approximately 3 to 4 weeks.
2. Cardiac:
Ischemia: The patient had a very small troponin leak of 0.15 on
March , 2005 , otherwise his troponins were negative. This was
likely demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis. After the
patient's blood pressure improved , we started him on a low-dose
beta-blocker , which he should continue. We held his ACE as his
blood pressure was generally about 90 to 100. If his blood
pressure improves slightly , we would recommend restarting the ACE
as an outpatient.
Pump: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and
an EF of 40%. He was slightly fluid overloaded after transfer
back from the CCU in the setting of getting fluids for sepsis.
He was diuresed intermittently very gently with IV Lasix at 20 ,
which seemed to improve the patient's shortness of breath and
wheezing , which correlated with the patient being more wet. He
was restarted on his own Lasix of 60 , for which he should
continue and also recommend having the patient receive daily
weight checks and to adjust Lasix in order to maintain daily
weight.
Rhythm: The patient is afib with left bundle-branch block
occasionally and RVR at Ening Health , which seemed to
correlate with fevers. But , he had a normal rate while inhouse
especially while on beta-blocker. He has an AICD , which seemed
to be working fine inhouse as well as a pacemaker.
2. Pulmonary: The patient has maintained on 2 to 3 liters at
which he is saturating at 93% to a 100%. He will likely need
oxygen for a few more days as some of his remaining fluid is
taken off. Please check oxygen saturations daily and titrate off
oxygen as he is able to.
3. Renal: The patient is with chronic renal insufficiency ,
baseline of 1.7. His range in the hospital was 1.7 to 2.5.
Pheno was checked which was approximate 33% and he did not have
any urine Eos or caths to suggest allergic interstitial nephritis
or ATN. Please repeat a creatinine in one week to ensure that it
remains stable. I suspect that as some of his fluid is taken
off , his flow will be better and his creatinine will be slightly
improved.
4. Endo: The patient is with diabetes. He was initially on
Portland protocol while in the Intensive Care Unit. On the
floor , he was maintained on NPH and a Regular Insulin sliding
scale. He should continue on NPH and this should be titrated in
order to maximize blood sugar control , so he should continue on a
Regular Insulin sliding scale. Once the patient is ready for
discharge to home , he should be switched back to his oral
hypoglycemics.
5. Heme: We held the patient's Coumadin or anticoagulation as
it is contraindicated in the setting of endocarditis. Now that
his sepsis seems to resolve , the patient should be restarted on
his Coumadin in approximately 3 to 4 days after discharge with a
goal of an INR of 2 to 3.
6. Psyche: The patient remained generally oriented to person
and situation to hospital while inhouse , but occasionally slide
down especially in the setting of having fevers. He was
continued on his home Zoloft and we added a small dose of
Zyprexa , which seemed to also help. The patient benefits from
regular reorientation which we suggest continuing.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient is to receive heparin t.i.d. and
PPI for DVT and ulcer prophylaxis respectively.
8. Access: The patient now has a PIC line , which is in place
and can be used for IV antibiotics.
DISCHARGE DIET: His discharge diet is a 2-g sodium ADA 1800 to
2000 calories per day , low saturated fat , low cholesterol , and
mechanical soft.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: His discharge medications are as follows;
Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. 6h. p.r.n. pain or temperature , aspirin 81
mg daily , Colace 100 b.i.d. , Lasix 60 p.o. daily , heparin 5000
units subcutaneous t.i.d. , NPH 16 units q.p.m. , Regular insulin
sliding scale a.c. and h.s. , Levoxyl 100 mcg daily , rifampin 300
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zoloft 50 p.o. daily , Atrovent nebulizer 0.5 mg
nebs q.4h. p.r.n. wheezing , nafcillin 2 g IV q. 4h , Zyprexa 2.5
mg p.o. nightly , miconazole 2% powder topical b.i.d. to rash ,
Advair Diskus 250/50 one puff inhaled b.i.d. , Duoneb q. 6h.
p.r.n. wheezing , Protonix 40 mg daily , Toprol XL 25 mg p.o.
daily , and allopurinol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
TO DO: The patient should follow up with his cardiologist Dr.
Gebauer and his PCP Dr. Lowell Blass once discharged from short-term
rehab. In addition , the patient should be seen by ID Clinic in
approximately 3 weeks to discuss remaining antibiotic therapy.
In addition , the patient should have a set of labs drawn in
approximately 5 to 7 days to recheck his creatinine. Please
check blood cultures if the patient has a temperature. Please
assess the NPH regimen as above. Please restart his Coumadin at
2.5 mg in 3 days with a goal INR of 2.3.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70-year-old man with
a history of non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease , status post three
vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1993 , chronic atrial
fibrillation , and hypercholesterolemia , who presents with
complaints of recent flu-like symptoms times two days , including

nonproductive cough with chills. The patient is followed by Dr.
Strubbe of the Hufi General Hospital , and by Dr. Torri of the
Onas Medical Center cardiology team. The patient recalls flu-like symptoms in
early April 1996 , but otherwise , was well until two days ago
when he noted the onset of right sided , sharp chest pain which was
well localized to the right chest , worse with breathing and chest
movement. The patient denied any similarity to previous anginal
pain , which he noted is more substernal in nature and has not
occurred in months. The patient was concerned that the pain was
cardiac and took two sublingual nitroglycerin without relief , and
therefore , presented to the Swebrothers Hospital Emergency
Room. The patient denied any nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis ,
shortness of breath , abdominal pain , melena , constipation ,
diarrhea , and hemoptysis , at the time of admission. He notes
history of chronic venostasis disease in his lower extremities with
bilateral decreased sensation and episodes of neuropathy pain which
has not changed recently.

2 mg p.o. q.day p.r.n. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. p.r.n. swelling , usually
one time per week , and Tylenol p.o. p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , vital signs
included a temperature to 101.4 , pulse 92 ,
respirations 28 , blood pressure 170/74 , and O2 saturation 89% on
room air with 94%-95% on two liters O2. HEENT examination revealed
moist mucous membranes without lesions. Pupils were equal , round ,
and reactive to light. Extraocular muscles were intact. Neck had
no LAD or JVD. Lungs had crackles present with egophony and E to A
change over the right low lateral lung field , otherwise , clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Heart had an irregular rhythm with a
regular rate. There was a II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
right upper sternal border and left lower sternal border. There
was normal S1 and S2 , no S3 or S4. Abdomen was soft , nontender ,
and nondistended with positive bowel sounds. Extremities revealed
1+ bilateral pitting edema with bilateral changes of chronic
venostasis , 1+ pedal pulses on the left , but left foot slightly
cool to touch. There was no palpable pulse in the right lower
extremity , but good capillary refill and warm. Neurological
examination revealed cranial nerves II-XII were intact bilaterally.
Motor was intact bilaterally. Sensory was intact to light touch
with decrease in sensory to light touch bilateral lower
extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count was 21.12 , hematocrit
38.8 , and platelets 191. INR was 2.1 , PTT 42.3.
Sodium was 136 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 98 , bicarbonate 25 , BUN 16 ,
creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 279. Admission EKG was significant for
atrial fibrillation at 76 beats per minute with evidence for cold
left bundle branch block. Chest x-ray was significant for right
middle lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor for
administration of intravenous antibiotics. The
patient did well overnight. In the a.m. of 4/5/97 , the patient
had an episode of hypoxia with increased requirement for oxygen and
ultimately required 100% face mask for 93% O2 saturation. The
patient denied any anginal chest pain , nausea , vomiting , or
increased shortness of breath. A stat EKG revealed no changes.
Stat chest x-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary edema. This
responded well to IV Lasix. However , the patient continued to
require increased amounts of oxygen over the next two days wherein
he had further episodes of pulmonary edema requiring p.r.n. IV
Lasix. During this time , blood cultures from the time of admission
grew out Pneumococcus times two which were sensitive to penicillin.
The patient's broad coverage antibiotics were then changed to IV
penicillin. An echocardiogram obtained on 4/5/97 revealed a high
normal left ventricular size with mild concentric hypertrophy ,
hypokinesis with inferior septum , and inferior posterior region ,
ejection fraction 45% , normal RV size and function , left atrial
enlargement , mild to moderate mitral regurgitation , and no aortic
stenosis or insufficiency. The patient was initiated on Captopril
which was then increased titrating with the patient's blood
pressure over his hospital stay. The patient , during his hospital
course , was also noted to have increased blood sugars to the 450
range. Therefore , he was started on a sliding scale insulin
regimen.
The patient improved with regards to his hypoxia and , on the
morning of 6/15/97 , he was breathing room air with an O2
saturation of 93%. His lung examination was significant for only
rare rhonchi on the right side. Chest x-ray of 3/4/97 revealed
improvement of his right lung pneumonia with persistence of
bilateral effusions consistent with his episodes of pulmonary
edema. Fingerstick glucose was 164 reflecting an overall
improvement and decreased need for sliding scale insulin. The
patient was felt to be well and ready for discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Coumadin 2.5 mg
one p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday , and Friday ,
and two p.o. q. Sunday , Saturday , Tuesday , and Thursday , Nitro-Dur
patch 0.4 mg per day to be removed at night , Captopril 25 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.a.m. , penicillin-V 500 mg p.o. q.i.d.
times seven more days , Mevacor 20 mg one p.o. q.p.m. , and glipizide
5 mg one p.o. q.a.m. and two p.o. q.p.m.
DISPOSITION: The patient is to be discharged. He will be staying
with family and is to follow up with the Aer Medical Center
cardiology team in 10 days. He is also to follow up with his
Ilos Bao Hospital doctor within three weeks. The patient is not
expected to have any disability and should recover well. He has
been instructed to call should he develop a high fever , further
chest pain , or shortness of breath.

with a history of Ehlers-Danlos , osteoarthritis and left knee
replacement in 1998 , and left hip replacement in 2002 who was leaving her
primary care physician's office and was hit by the elevator door and fell to
the ground. She suffered a left periprosthetic fracture of her left distal
femur. She was initially admitted to Manteton Hothood Medical Center where
she was found to have , by report , a closed distal femur fracture
between her prior ORIF and TKR with no neurovascular deficits.

LABS ON ADMISSION: Sodium 137 , potassium 3.6 , chloride 114 ,
bicarbonate 26 , BUN 17 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 148 , and calcium
9. White count 11.6 , hematocrit 39.6 , and platelets 170. INR
1.1 , PT 14.2 , and PTT 21.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Upon admission to SHAMC ,
Ms. Sovel underwent an echocardiogram to rule out any ca
rdiac
abnormalities. Her ejection fraction was revealed to be 50% with
no wall motion abnormalities and only mild aortic insufficiency.
She was determined to be medically stable to go the operating room by Internal
Meidicine. On January , 2005 , she underwent an open reduction
and internal
fixation of her left femur fracture with a LISS plate placement.
Postoperative film showed good placement of hardware and good
alignment of her fracture. Her postoperative course was
complicated only by mild hypotension ( systolic blood
pressures in the 70s ) and by shortness of breath. She was
successfully treated with fluid boluses and inhaled nebulizers
respectively. Postoperative chest x-ray revealed lower lobe
atelectasis. Once she was more mobile by postoperative day #3 ,
her blood pressure and O2 saturation stabilized. The remainder
of her postoperative course was uncomplicated. She was kept on
perioperative antibiotics and as well as prophylactic Lovenox
while in house. She was kept touchdown weightbearing on her left
lower extremity. Her dressing was removed on postoperative day
#2. She was evaluated by physical therapy who worked with her to
increase her activity. She was deemed safe for discharge to
rehabilitation. Upon discharge , her left lower extremity was
neurovascularly intact. Her incision was clean , dry , and intact
and healing well. She is discharged in stable condition with
instruction to continue Lovenox and left lower extremity
touchdown weightbearing status until followup in clinic in two
weeks.
TO DO PLAN:
1. Touchdown weightbearing , left lower extremity.
2. Follow up with Dr. Lassetter in two weeks.
3. Continue Lovenox until next appointment with Dr. Macnaughton .

incontinence , recurrent UTIs , hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 89-year-old woman with
insulin dependent diabetes , coronary
artery disease , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , and
ejection fraction of 28% who had a left fem-peroneal bypass in the
past presented with on-going left toe pain admitted for left toe
vascular insufficiency and cellulitis refractory to treatment for
two months. The patient reported having her podiatrist clip her
nails about two months ago which is when her pain in her foot
started. She denies any fever , chills , cough , shortness of breath ,
nausea , or vomiting. At home she was able to ambulate , but had
significant pain localizing to her left foot and toe. She was
recently admitted here on July for the same
complaint treated with IV levofloxacin and clindamycin for five
days and then went home on ten days of dicloxacillin , then Keflex.
She comes back on the April with the same pain
and infection in her left foot. On admission she was afebrile with
mild tachycardia and stable blood pressure. Exam was notable for a
soft systolic ejection murmur at the base , non-palpable pulses in
her left lower extremity. Left foot was cool. There was swelling
over the dorsum of her left foot to the ankle. There was a
superficial ulcer along the medial aspect of the nail bed without
purulence. She had normal white blood cell count and negative
blood cultures taken here.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for recurrent vascular
insufficiency with superimposed cellulitis likely
due to her poor lower extremity perfusion from her peripheral
vascular disease. An MRI was obtained which was concerning for
early osteomyelitis and there was concern that her bypass graft in
her left leg was not patent. She had angiography of the left leg
vessels and proceeded to get stenting of the left common iliac and
external iliac vessels without complication on May .  Also
during her hospitalization she had elevated LFTs which were
attributed to a three gram dose of Unasyn that she received in the
Emergency Room. The Unasyn was changed to IV clindamycin and levo ,
and a right upper quadrant ultrasound showed a calcified
gallbladder wall and no obstruction , and her LFTs then began to
normalize. Her cardiac status remained stable throughout her
admission and she is to be treated with Plavix 75 mg for 30 days
after the stenting of her iliac vessels. A PICC line was placed on
the day of discharge for on-going IV antibiotics

Discharge Date: 2/5/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Raffo is a 59-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery
disease status post small non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in
October of 2000 and also status post cardiac catheterization with 2
vessel disease , small left PICA cerebrovascular accident ,
congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in October
revealing an ejection fraction of 30%. Also diabetes mellitus type
II complicated by retinopathy , nephropathy and question neuropathy.
History of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia as well who
presented to Dr. Bouie clinic on May , 2001 with
progressive increasing dyspnea , increasing abdominal girth and
weight gain over the past few months.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus x 20 years , chronic renal
insufficiency with the last creatinine in
January of 3.5 , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
30% in October of 2000 , coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction , October 2000 question f silent myocardial
infarction x 2 , history of hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin daily , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day ,
Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg p.o. q day , toprol XL
50 mg p.o. q day , insulin 70/30 65/45 , Actos 45 q p.m , Avapro 300
mg p.o. q day , Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , sublingual nitroglycerin
p.r.n..
PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.1 , blood pressure 116/70 , pulse 88 ,
primary care physician of 18. The patient appeared
to be in no acute distress. Jugular venous pressure approximately
13 cm water. LUNGS: Faint bibasilar rales. CARDIAC:
Tachycardia , regular rhythm without murmurs. ABDOMEN: Positive ,
normal active bowel sounds. Obese , distended and nontender.
EXTREMITIES: 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulse , 2-3 plus edema
bilaterally to the knees.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: It was felt that given notes
of thyroid dysfunction , his history was
consistent with fluid overload. His jugular venous pressure was
elevated and he had 3plus pitting edema to the knees without
significant rales on chest exam. He was aggressively diuresed with
doses of Lasix 200 mg b.i.d. IV as well as Zaroxolyn. Weight on
admission was 135 kilograms and on discharge he was down to 132
kilograms. A repeat echocardiogram at Ethool Hospital
showed an ejection fraction of 30-35 , left ventricular dimensions
of 47 mm , 1 plus mitral regurgitation and global hypokinesis as
well as moderate right ventricular dysfunction. Abdominal
ultrasound showed no ascites despite extremely distended abdomen
and right renal cyst x 2. Follow up abdominal CT also showed there
was no mass or ascites and his distended abdomen was likely due to
adipose tissue. Diuresis was limited by acute and chronic renal
failure and oliguria. Diuresis was held from May , 2001.
Right heart catheterization on February , 2001 showed mildly
elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and moderately elevated
right ventricular pressures. Dopamine was started on June ,
2001 to aid with renal perfusion and diuresis and he was then
weaned off of that on July , 2001. His Lasix was stopped on
July , 2001 and he auto-diuresed until the time of discharge
with stable blood pressure. He remained stable with no dyspnea at
rest and is symptom free at the time of discharge.
2. Renal: His basic chronic renal insufficiency is likely
secondary to poor diabetic control with a creatinine of 2.5 on October , 2001 , 3.3 at the time of admission. Acute renal failure with
increasing creatinine of 6 after aggressive diuresis with a mean of
0.8 percent. Renal function improved with creatinine of 4.1 on
July , 2001 with autodiuresis. The renal service was
consulted to comment on the nature of the patient's renal
insufficiency and acute renal failure as well as to assist in the
use of vasodilators.
3. Endocrine: He has a long standing history of type II diabetes
complicated by retinopathy and neuropathy and nephropathy. He was
maintained on his outpatient endocrine regimen during his stay.
The patient was discharged home with services. He is to follow up
with Dr. Marro on November , 2001 at 3:30 p.m. , with Dr. Loatman on

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Pt is a 65 yo w/CHF presenting w/episode of Vtach
at outside hospital. Pt. felt somewhat nauseous on coming home from
work on day PTA. Wife noticed pallor when he came home , called
ambulance. Was found to be in monomorphic Vtach to 200 which responded
to lidocaine. Lidocaine drip d/c'd in AM of transfer in the abscene of
further VT. Pt found to have troponin of 0.8 at
outside hospital. It was initially unclear if the pt had an ischemic
event which caused VT , or if the pt's VT caused a bump in cardiac
enzymes. Pt also has anginal equivalent w/jaw pain which
worsens when the pt carries heavy things or walks
up flights of stairs. Recent outside echocardiogram showed EF 15-20% ,
w/ global hypokinesis. PE onadmission w/JVP 10 cm , faint crackles ,
II/VI SEM worse w/inc. afterload. EKG , unchanged from
11/1 .
HOSPITAL
COURSE 1. Ischemia - The patient was admitted to the cardiac
service. Given the presence of vtach and a slight EKG bump , and
clinical signs of heart failure , the initial presentation was
suspicious for CAD. The
patient was initially diuresed slowly , however , the pt began to develop
worsening HTN and shortness of breath along w/a prolonged episode of
vtach and was subsequently
diuresed aggressively by approximately 5 L. The patient was also
loaded w/amiodarone. The patient's weight also dropped 5 kg. Left and
right
coronary catheterization were performed and revealed only a discrete rt
PDA lesion 60% and a discrete 60% D1 , otherwise essentially clean. No
interventions were
necessary. The right heart catheterization revealed a PCWP of 6 after
the diuresis. The patient had no further vtach episodes on amiodarone
and was discharged on 400 mg qd of amiodarone.
The patient had an
ICD placed on 3/16/2004 .  The initial plan was for the patient to also
have his aflutter ablated to decrease the propensity for vtach ,
however , the presence of a lt atrial clot could not be ruled out during
TEE , so rhythm ablation was deferred. An transthroracic echocardiogram
was
also performed prior to discharge which revealed EF of 30% , w/anterior
akinesis and global hypokinesis. A broad differential diagnosis for his
heart failure was entertained , however no conclusive etiology could be
determined. The patient is to follow up with his cardiologist and his P
CP. These appointments were coordinated by the attending physician ,
Dr. Versteegh . He should also follow up w/Dr. Yafuso as described in that
section. For the patient's afib , he should take coumadin , 5 mg , for the
next three nights and should subsequently drop down to 2.5 mg qd ,
unless differently as suggested by his INR which should be drawn on
Monday , May , and Wed September by the VNA. The patient should call an
MD immediately w/chest pain , sob , or pallor. The patient's blood
pressure medications were also significantly adjusted to maximum doses
while the patient was under close acute care monitoring to facilitate
optimization of his outpt regimens. Additional changes at the
discretion of the pt's PCP , Dr. Schwarm . The patient also presented w/an
elevated creatinine which slowly returned to normal levels during the
hospitalization. The elevated creatinine was most likely due to a
combination of hypoperfusion secondary to vtach , and dye load from
catheterization.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
F/u as described above. INR on June .  Stop old medications.
Take only medications as prescribed from here.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Gerache is a 59 yo man with poorly controlled diabetes , asthma
who presented with chest pain. Over the past few weeks he has had
intermittent chest pain with activity , lasting 5 minutes , relieved
with rest. He also has shortness of breath when he
climbs stairs , but he said that this is more from
his asthma. He presented to his PCP because of
a finger injury , and then told him about the
chest pain. Pt was sent to the ED. He has
been chest pain free since the day before admission.
His finger sticks at home have been in the 200-300 range.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV - ischemia: Mr. Wanzer had a cardiac catheterization on the mor
ning of 10/06 .  He has had 3 sets of negative enzymes ( elevated CKMB but
negative troponins ). EKG significant only for j point elevation
diffusely.
-beta blocker was started
-cholesterol was checked ( elevated triglycerides 308 , total cholesterol
146 , HDL 29 ). Baseline LFTs checked.
-statin was started
-aspirin was held because of the patient's stated allergy to aspirin
( causes asthma type symptoms )
-will start patient on low-dose lisinopril
PUMP: no prior echo , consider as outpatient. appears
euvolemic.
rhythm: no active issues.
2. ENDO - on insulin at home but rarely checks his sugars. when he
does it's usually 200-300s. Hemoglobin A1c is 10.7.
Patient was continued on home regimen of NPH insulin but clearly needs
better control of his sugars as outpatient.
3. PULM:
pt says he has had asthma as a child. no record of PFTs but should
obtain as outpatient. Home inhalers continued
4. RENAL: Mr. Gaulding currently has good renal function but needs to
have his Cr checked after starting the lisinopril.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You must have your kidney function checked within 1 week , please make
an appointment with your primary care doctor. Please take your
medications as instructed. Please follow up with Dr. Shiley , your
cardiologist within 4-6 weeks.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Please consider carefully your lifestyle , including your diet and
exercise plans. Although you did not have blockages in your heart
vessels requiring stenting , you have started to have blockages , so the
best thing you can do is to slow this process down. This includes
losing weight through diet and exercise , taking medications including
statin , beta blocker ( atenolol ) and ACE inhibitor ( lisinopril ).

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted on 8/19/05 , and underwent diagnostic
catheterization before surgery which showed right dominant
circulation and clean coronary artery. The patient on 6/18/05
was taken to the operating room and underwent a minimally
invasive AVR replacement with a 21 Carpentier-Edwards magna
valve. Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 120 minutes ,
crossclamp time was 51 minutes. The patient was weaned off the
cardiopulmonary bypass without any difficulty , on no pressors and
was taken up to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit and
extubated 4 hours later. The patient's postop course by systems ,
neurologically remained intact but had severe pain issues due to
the chest tube and pain consult was obtained and was put on a PCA
until the chest tube was removed at which point patient was put
back on her preop Ultram and was comfortable without any further
narcotic use.
Cardiovascular: Patient remained in normal sinus rhythm
throughout her postoperative course with rates in the 60s to 70s
with low-dose beta-blocker and thus will be discharged to home on
only on 25 mg t.i.d. of Lopressor
Respiratory: The patient was extubated 4 hours postoperatively
and weaned off O2 without any difficulty.
GI: The patient had no issues , was put on Pepcid for GI
prophylaxis. The patient with a history of GERD and was put back
on Pepcid
Renal: Due to her allergies to Lasix , the patient was placed on
torsemide and by the postoperative day 4 , patient was making
several liters without any torsemide and so the decision was made
for the patient to be discharged to home without any torsemide ,
even though she was on 20 mg p.o. q. day preoperatively and
recommended patient to follow up with her cardiologist in a week
to see if she needs to be placed back on torsemide and needs
further diuresis.
Endocrine: The patient was on a protein protocol intraoperative
but had no further insulin requirement and was not a diabetic
preoperatively with normal A1c of 5.5 and the patient was
discharged to home without any medication.
Heme: The patient due to her allergies to aspirin and was not
placed on any anticoagulants.
ID: The patient had no infectious issue , was on vancomycin for
surgical prophylaxis. The patient was doing quite well
ambulating and back on Ultram and no further pain issues and a
decision was made for the patient to be discharged to home on
postoperative day 5.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
The patient will be discharged on these following medications ,
Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Niferex
150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 50 mg q. hours sleep , Ultram 50 mg
q.6h. p.r.n. pain , and Pepcid 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
FOLLOWUP:
The patient should make these follow up appointments with her
cardiologist Dr. Clarenbach in 1 week. His phone number is

ATTENDING: RAFAEL WASKO M.D.
Admitted to the Renal Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Septic arthritis and bacteremia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 54-year-old male with factor IX hemophilia , HCV with
cirrhosis and chronic ascites , HIV , diabetes , end-stage renal
disease on dialysis , and history of multiple infections including
mitral valve endocarditis , and bilateral knee replacement and
left hip replacement who was transferred from rehab with a
painful right knee in a prosthetic joint which was concerning for
a septic joint. He was in his rehab therapy one week prior to
admission when he twisted his knee. He gave him some factor IX
at this time with some relief , but in the intervening time , it
had become more painful , red and swollen , and was unable to walk
without great difficulty where as before he had been tolerating
rehab with a walker without incident. In addition , he had a
temperature to 103.0 degrees , two days prior to admission and was
given vancomycin and gentamicin dialysis the day prior to
admission. The knee , however , continued to worsen , and he has a
significant restriction in range of motion , and he reported to
the emergency department for concern for an infected knee versus
hemarthrosis. He reported some fatigue and decreased p.o.
intake. He did have chills with his fever. He denied any
shortness of breath , chest pain , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting
or bleeding. Of note , he has chronic ascites , which for the past
three months has required paracentesis three times weekly with a
total of 3 to 4 liters taken off each time. In the emergency
department , he was loaded with factor IX by the hematology
fellow. The knee was then tapped by Orthopedics , which
demonstrated only some dark blood and minimal fluid. He was
admitted to the Renal Service given that he is a dialysis
patient.

1. Hemophilia factor IX deficiency.
2. Hepatitis C virus with cirrhosis and chronic ascites.
3. HIV.
4. End-stage renal disease , on dialysis.
5. Diabetes type 2.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
He is married , has five children. He has HIV and HCV from
transfusion. He is not currently working.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Notable for factor IX deficiency hemophilia.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
The patient was afebrile , slight tachycardiac at 105 , and
normotensive at 120/72 , sating well on room air. General: He
was cachetic and chronically ill appearing , alert and oriented ,
and comfortable. Neck veins were flat. Cardiovascular exam was
notable for regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 , S2 and a 3/6
holosystolic murmur at the apex. Chest was notable for mild
bibasilar crackles , otherwise clear. Abdomen was distended ,
notable for flank dullness. He did have normal active bowel
sounds and a peritoneal port on the right. Extremities were
notable for being wasted , warm with absent pulses. Right knee
was erythematous , edematous , and extremely tender to palpation.
LABS ON ADMISSION:
Notable for potassium of 5.2 , BUN of 42 , and creatinine of 4.2.
His liver function panel was within normal limits. His white
blood cell count was 10.4 , hematocrit 36.6 , and platelets
332 , 000. His PT was 15.4 , PTT 62.3 , and INR was 1.2. X-ray of
his right knee demonstrated an effusion and no fracture. A chest
x-ray demonstrated a small left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
His erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 70.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
On 8/22/04 , he had an incision and drainage of his right knee by
Dr. Moelter of Orthopedics. On 10/20/04 , he had a
hemodialysis-tunneled catheter placed by Interventional
Radiology. On 2/7/04 , he had a PICC line placed at the
bedside , and he underwent hemodialysis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Musculoskeletal and Infectious Disease: He was admitted to
the Renal Service for treatment of septic arthritis of his right
knee , which was a prosthetic joint. Blood cultures were positive
for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus , which was the
organism , which had caused his prior endocarditis. He underwent
incision and drainage of his right knee by Orthopedic Service ,
Dr. Majka , on 8/22/04 .  In addition , his hemodialysis catheter
was pulled on 10/15/04 because it too had grown blood cultures
positive for MSSA. He had no further positive cultures once his
dialysis catheter was pulled except for 1/4 bottles coag-negative
Staph from 9/23/04 , which was attributed to contamination. He
was treated with vancomycin and gentamicin just after dialysis.
He received a total of seven days of gentamicin and was on day
#14 of a six-week course of vancomycin upon discharge. He had
some low-grade temperature during admission but only one
temperature spiked to 101 degrees. Both Orthopedics and
Infectious Disease Services were consulted and followed him
throughout admission. Orthopedics and Infectious Disease
consultant determined that if any blood cultures became positive
after removal of the hemodialysis catheter , he would need to
return to the OR for joint exploitation. Given his negative
culture this did not occur and he is discharged with prosthetic
joint in place. The joint fluid culture as well synovial tissue
and synovial culture from his I&D were positive for MSSA.
Surveillance cultures were negative for seven days following the
procedure. He was instructed to continue vancomycin for a total
of six-week course and to follow up with Infectious Disease in
two months. He was cleared for physical therapy and returned to
rehab by Orthopedics with instructions to remove his sutures
three weeks after discharge and to follow up with Orthopedic , Dr.
Glader , as indicated by his symptom.
2. Hematology: He has factor IX deficiency hemophilia for which
he normally takes q. week or twice weekly factor IX before
dialysis. During admission , he was initially loaded with factor
IX in the emergency department for arthrocentesis. Hematology
was consulted and they recommended b.i.d. factor IX 4000 units
during admission while the situation regarding surgery and line
placement was unclear. He continued receiving b.i.d. factor IX
until the day of discharge as his last line was placed on that
day. He was to return to factor IX before dialysis only upon
return to rehab and was to follow up with Dr. Tutson , his
primary hematologist. In addition , he received erythropoietin
with dialysis.
3. Renal: He has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis
Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays. He continued this regimen
while he had his hemodialysis catheter in place , however , when
that was removed , he was dialyzed to a temporary femoral artery
catheter and only as clinically indicated. He was dialyzed most
recently on 10/20/04 after his dialysis catheter was replaced by
Interventional Radiology , and he should return to his Monday ,
Wednesday , Friday schedule. He was continued on his home renal
supplements. He was continued on erythropoietin with dialysis
and midodrine.
4. GI: He has HCV cirrhosis and chronic ascites and history of
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as well as upper and lower GI
bleed. He had no evidence of bleeding during admission. The
occult blood was negative x3. He additionally had no evidence of
infection or SPP. He was taped by a peritoneal port thrice
weekly with removal of 3 to 4 liters of fluid each time. The
first set was sent for culture , which was negative.
Additionally , he was continued on his b.i.d. proton pump
inhibitor given his history of upper GI bleed.
5. Endocrine: He has diabetes for which he was covered with
Regular Insulin sliding scale upon admission. Given some
elevated blood sugars up to 300s and the risk of bacteremia , he
was started on NPH and was discharged on 10 q.a.m. and 5 q.p.m.
with continued Regular Insulin sliding scale for added coverage.
6. Prophylaxis: He was not anticoagulated despite his
immobility. Given his hemophilia , he was placed on TED hose and
pneumoboots and continued on his PPI.
7. FEN: Nutrition was consulted because of his low albumin and
general cachexia. He was placed on a 1.5 liters fluid
restriction and 2 g sodium restriction given his chronic ascites.
He is also on a diabetic diet and renal diet. Nutrition
recommended supplementing with Enlive and Ensure , and the patient
had adequate oral intake during admission. He was not given IV
fluids.
DISPOSITION:
He has full code. He was discharged in stable condition to rehab
with instructions to follow up with his new primary care doctor ,
Dr. Ezequiel Strawn , Orthopedics as needed by symptoms with his
regular hematologist , his regular renal physician , and with

Discharge Date: 3/15/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
PROCEDURES PERFORMED: October , 1997 , coronary artery bypass graft
times three with left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending artery , and saphenous vein graft to diagonal
one.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Effner is a 74 year-old
gentleman , status post inferior
myocardial infarction in 1995 , and percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex in September , 1995. The
patient is also status post stenting of the left anterior
descending artery in September , 1996. After that time , the patient
continued to have chest pain , although with decreased frequency and
intensity. The patient did receive Ticlid for six to eight weeks
following the stenting.
The patient presented with increased frequency and duration of his
chest and epigastric pain. The patient denied shortness of breath ,
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , diaphoresis , nausea or
vomiting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , hyperlipidemia , paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation in 1982 , osteoarthritis and diet controlled
diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES: Amoxicillin , which gives him arthritis.
MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d.;
Imdur 120 milligrams p.o. q.a.m. and 60 milligrams
p.o. q.p.m.; Cozaar 100 milligrams p.o. q.a.m.; Atenolol 50
milligrams p.o. q.d.; Norvasc 5 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has no smoking history and rarely
drinks alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Sclerae are anicteric. Oropharynx without
lesions. Carotids 2+ without bruits. The
neck is supple. The lungs are clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular examination is a regular rate and rhythm with an S4.
Normal S1/S2. Abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended , with
normal active bowel sounds. Extremities are without edema.
Dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse and femoral pulses
are 2+ bilaterally without bruits in the femoral arteries.
Neurological examination is without gross focal abnormality.
LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count 9.8 , hematocrit 40.8.
Glucose 188 , creatinine 1.8. CK 40.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Service
for management and evaluation of his angina. He
underwent cardiac catheterization on June , 1997 , demonstrating
90% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis , 99% diagonal
one ostial stenosis; circumflex was okay. The right coronary
artery had a mid stenosis of 50%. The patient arrived in the
Catheterization Lab with mild angina on 200 micrograms per minute
of intravenous nitroglycerin. Post catheterization , the patient
developed 5/10 chest pain with an increasing pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure to 40 and D-waves of 52. Increasing the
nitroglycerin led to resolution of these changes. The patient had
intra-aortic balloon pump placed via the right femoral artery with
return of the wedge to approximately a mean of 6 and his pain was
relieved. The patient returned to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit
where he underwent aggressive heart rate and blood pressure
control. He was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery and taken to the
Operating Room on October , 1997 , for coronary artery bypass
grafting times three as described above. The patient was
transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Electrocardiogram
remained unchanged. He was extubated without difficulty. The
intra-aortic balloon pump was removed. The patient was noted to
have slight confusion on postoperative day number one and two.
Lopressor was restarted and the patient was gently diuresed. His
chest tubes were discontinued. On postoperative day number three ,
the patient was noted to be slightly more confused with left facial
droop and aphasia that resolved with mild left lid lag in the early
afternoon. The patient was evaluated by Neurology. A head CT scan
was performed , demonstrating no hemorrhage or acute stroke. There
was a small left cerebellar hemisphere lesion that was believed to
be consistent with a lesion that was greater than 24 hours old.
The patient , however , became progressively encephalopathic. The
patient underwent an echocardiogram and carotid studies , which
demonstrated no evidence of embolic source. The patient's
expressive aphasia and facial weakness , however , recurred. The
patient again underwent head CT scan , demonstrating acute right
parietal infarction that appeared cortically based. Given the
recent intra-aortic balloon pump placement , the aorta could not be
ruled out as a source for embolus. Therefore , heparin was started ,
as was Coumadin. The goal INR is 2 to 3. Also the patient had a
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , and although had no
evidence of atrial fibrillation , there was concern over potential
cardiac source for embolization. The patient's aphasia and left
facial droop improved steadily. He was evaluated by the Speech and
Swallowing Service. He had no difficulty with swallowing; however ,
it was felt that he would benefit from language therapy in addition
to his physical therapy and occupational therapy. The remainder of
the patient's course was uncomplicated from a cardiac standpoint.
His chest x-ray prior to discharge demonstrated very small left
sided effusion without any significant failure.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to rehabilitation
for reconditioning and intensive speech , physical
therapy and occupational therapy. He will follow-up with Data Medical Center
Cardiology in one to two weeks. He will follow-up with Dr. Bost
in four to six weeks. He will receive physical therapy ,
occupational therapy and speech therapy. He must also follow-up
with his internist , as he has been requiring a sliding scale
insulin dosing , with previously diet controlled diabetes.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol #3 one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h.
p.r.n. pain; Colace 100 milligrams p.o.
t.i.d.; sliding scale insulin; Lopressor 50 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.;
Coumadin , with goal INR of 2-3 , to be dosed q.d. after checking a
prothrombin time.

without prior cardiac history. He has
cardiac risk factors including possible hypertension , and possible
history of hypercholesterolemia. The patient has had a history of
atypical chest pain , including a cardiac workup in the past with an
echocardiogram in 1995 showing concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy , asymmetric septal hypertrophy. He had a normal
ejection fraction at this time. In October of 1997 , he had an
exercise tolerance test at which time he went eight minutes , with a
maximal heart rate of 151 , maximal blood pressure 226/90 , and no
electrocardiogram changes. At 2 p.m. on the day of admission he
developed substernal chest pain with a crushing tightness ,
radiating to both shoulders and his jaw. He was not short of
breath. He experiences pain on and off through the afternoon ,
although the pain was never completely gone. At 6 p.m. , he became
acutely worse , and at that time called the EMT and was brought to
Nama Emergency Department. Within the
Emergency Department , the patient was noted to have ST elevations
in the inferior leads. He was enrolled in the NPA/TPA trial.
Infusion was begun at 8:15. The patient was given Lopressor ,
oxygen , morphine , aspirin , and heparin. He did not drop his
pressure with sublingual nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history includes prostate
cancer in September 1997 , status post XRT , as well
as a possible transient ischemic attack in 1990.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Medications included Zantac p.r.n.
FAMILY HISTORY: Family history was negative for coronary artery
disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married with three children. He
denies any tobacco or alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission
demonstrated a well-appearing black male in
no acute distress. Vital signs were a heart rate of 48 , blood
pressure 83/30 in the Emergency Department , he was afebrile , with
oxygen saturation level 99 percent on two liters. HEENT
examination , the oropharynx is benign , he had a left facial droop.
The neck was supple , 2+ carotids without bruit. Jugular venous
distention was normal. The chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally. The heart had a regular bradycardic rhythm with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur. The abdomen was soft , non-tender ,
non-distended , positive bowel sounds , no organomegaly. The
extremities were warm and well-perfused , no clubbing , cyanosis or
edema , trace distal pulses. Neurologically , he was alert and
oriented x three , cranial nerves 2 through 12 are grossly intact
except for a left facial droop. Motor and sensory were grossly
intact.
ADMISSION LABORATORY: Admission labs showed a sodium of 144 ,
potassium 4.2 , chloride 108 , bicarbonate of
22 , BUN 16 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 136. White count was 8 with a
hematocrit of 35 , platelets were 239 , CK was 276 with an MB of 0.8.
Troponin on admission was 0.0. INR was 1.0 , partial thromboplastin
time was 22.6. The patient's first electrocardiogram in the
Emergency Department showed normal sinus rhythm at 70 with
first-degree AV block , axis of 56 degrees. He had ST elevations of
4 millimeters in leads 3 and aVF , 3 millimeters in 2 , ST depression
0.5 to 3 millimeters V2 through V5 , 1 and aVL. Chest x-ray did not
showed acute disease in the Emergency Department.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Within the Emergency Department , the patient
initially had resolution of his electrocardiogram
changes , but had persistent jaw pain , remaining at 5/10. He was
taken to catheterization , which demonstrated a mid right coronary
artery lesion of approximately 95 percent with a clot , but with
TIMI-III flow. No intervention was done at that time. The patient
initially required vigorous intravenous hydration to maintain good
blood pressure , but remained essentially stable and pain-free. He
had a drop in hematocrit from 35 on admission to 28 after his
catheterization secondary to blood loss of the right femoral triple
lumen site placed in the Emergency Ward prior to tPA , blood loss at
catheterization , small hematoma and dilution. He was given two
units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in his
hematocrit. The patient was then transferred to the Floor , where
he maintained his good course. He had no postcatheterization or
post myocardial infarction chest pain. The decision was then made
to take the patient back to the Catheterization Laboratory to have
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stenting of
this lesion , and to see if it continued to persist.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Serafine is a 78-year-old gentleman who presented with
increasing dyspnea on exertion and New York Heart
Association Class III heart failure. The patient also complained of fatigue
over the last four years prior to admission. He currently denied
any angina , diaphoresis , nausea , orthopnea , PND , presyncope or
syncope. The patient had been treated with serial transthoracic
echocardiograms which revealed an ejection fraction worsening
from 60% down to 40% along with aortic stenosis. The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization , which revealed no significant coronary artery disease
and elevated left and right
heart filling pressures. Cardiac catheterization was abandoned
prematurely due to the increasing filling pressures. Echocardiogram was

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Delcour was brought to the operating room on 7/9/07
where he underwent a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement
with a 25-mm Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve. Total bypass
time was 101 minutes , total crossclamp time was 63 minutes. Intraoperatively ,
the patient was found to have a calcified trileaflet
aortic valve. The patient came off bypass without incident , was brought to the
Intensive Care Unit on 3 mcg of epinephrine and insulin and
Precedex. The patient did well and was brought up in stable
condition in normal sinus rhythm. Postoperatively , the patient
was extubated and the Electrophysiology Service was consulted to
evaluate his internal pacemaker which was reprogrammed and
functioning well. The patient continued to require vigorous
diuresis with a Lasix drip. He was extubated on postoperative day #1 without
incident. The patient was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on
postoperative day 5. The patient experienced some postoperative
tachycardia and his beta-blocker was increased with good result.
He was also found to have a positive urinary tract infection and
was started on ciprofloxacin for a total of five days. The
patient at one point required 5 liters of nasal cannula to get
his saturations in the 90s. He did continue to require
intravenous Lasix but had weaned Lasix drip and had intermittent
boluses of 40 mg IV to promote diuresis with good result. He was
weaned off his oxygen and the patient began to ambulate and was

Hospital course:
This is a lovely 79 year-old lady with multiple risk factors for
atheroscosis , including long standing HTN with evidence of LVH on Echo
from 2004 , DM II complicated by neuropathy , hyperlipidemia , and age.
She presented with overt symptoms and clinical signs of congestive heart
failure , including complaints of progressive shortness of breath , PND ,
fatigue , and peripheral edema. Her physical exam was significant for an
elevated JVP , lower extremity edema , pulmonary rales , laterally displaced
PMI , and S3 gallop , all consistent with heart failure. Even though the
patient had cardiolmegaly on CXR from 2004 , her LVEF was about 60% ,
suggesting a recent development of CHF. Her EKG showed NSR with new LBBB ,
and no QW. Due to her multiple atherosclerotic risk factors , new LBBB ,
and evidence of neuropathy , the initial impression was that she had a
recent ischemic event. Three sets of cardiac enzymes were negative
during her first 24 hours stay. She had a stress MIBI showing no
scars or evidence of reversible ischemia with a calculated EF of 23%. An
Echo showed dilated LV , with globaly reduced LE function and near normal
pulmonary pressures , suggestive of dilated cardiomaypathy. Extensive
interviewing of the patinet was negative for other possible etiologies of
HF , TSH and A1C were normal , and and the cause of her dilated CMP
remained undifined. she was diuresed to a dry weight of 57Kg , responded
well to PO Lasix ( 40-60mg ) , treated also with Toprol XL 25mg , and
Spironolactone 12.5mg. Her symptos completely resolved both at rest and
with gentle ambulation. One can argue toward evaluating her coronaray
arteries either by cath or CTA to exclude balanced ischemia. However
considering her age , no changed in EKGs , negative MIBI , and an Echo with
globaly reduced EF , we choose to medicaly treat her. she will be
evaluated in the future for AICD/CRT , then a cath can also be considered.
She will follow up with Dr. Rafael Abeita .

Discharge Date: 5/12/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 78-year-old gentleman
who is admitted for aortic valve
replacement on August , 2002. He has has asymptomatic aortic
stenosis. He also has known coronary artery disease having
undergone angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary
artery in 1991. Catheterization at that time demonstrated an 80%
left anterior descending lesion and a 60% first diagonal lesion.
He has had a 4-5 year history of shortness of breath diagnosed with
mild aortic stenosis and followed clinically. In the planning
process for knee surgery , serial echocardiograms were performed
showing decreased aortic valve area and decreasing ejection
fraction. Most recent echocardiogram shows moderate to severe
aortic stenosis and has been suggested to have the valve replaced
before undergoing knee surgery. The patient was admitted for
elective aortic valve replacement prior to knee surgery. He has a
history of class II heart failure , slight limitation of physical
activity. He is in normal sinus rhythm.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , degenerative
joint disease of the bilateral knees , left greater than right ,
status post left total knee replacement in 1994 with persistent
symptoms to undergo surgery for his knee , benign prostatic
hypertrophy , decreasing hearing , left greater than right.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: A total knee replacement in 1994 ,
appendectomy in the 1960s.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Diltiazem ER 180 mg once a day , Isordil
30 mg three times a day , enteric coated
aspirin 325 mg once a day , Zocor 10 mg once a day , Cozaar 25 mg
once a day , Humulin N 30 units in the morning and 14 units in the
evening.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Heart rate 80 and regular.
HEENT: Dentition is without evidence of
infection. NECK: No carotid bruits were heard. CHEST: Clear.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. He has a systolic ejection murmur
at 3/6 in the aortic area radiating to the carotids. ABDOMEN:
Soft and non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Left total knee replacement
incision , no varicose veins. NEUROLOGICAL: Intact.
LABORATORY: Laboratory studies on admission include a BUN of 13 ,
creatinine 1.3 , white blood cell count 6.0 , hematocrit
40.7. His echocardiogram performed on June , 2001 demonstrated
an TPP Hospital65% , aortic stenosis with a mean gradient
of 42 mm Hg , peak gradient of 63 mm Hg , calculated valve area of
0.9 cm squared with mild mitral insufficiency , trivial
insufficiency and a mildly dilated left atrium. EKG shows normal
sinus rhythm at 88. Chest x-ray is clear.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent coronary arteriography on
August , 2002 at Wi Wirolllen Hospital .
This examination showed a right dominant system with a diffuse 40%
lesion of the left main , discrete 50% lesion of his proximal left
anterior descending coronary artery , a 70% lesion of his mid left
anterior descending artery with an 80% distal lesion. He also had
an 80% lesion of his first diagonal and a diffuse 50% proximal
lesion of the same vessel , 70% ostial lesion of his circumflex and
an eccentric 45% lesion of his right coronary artery with a 70%
lesion in his large left ventricular branch. The patient went to
the operating room on August , 2002 where he underwent an aortic
valve replacement with a #23 Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve
and a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery ,
saphenous vein graft to the first marginal and saphenous vein graft
to the posterior left ventricular branch. His intraoperative
course was uneventful. He was seen in consultation by the Diabetic
Management Service for blood sugar control and initiation into the
Portland Protocol for intravenous insulin. His postoperative
course was complicated by an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation
which was treated with replacement of his electrolytes and
initiation of Lopressor therapy and also mild anemia that was
monitored and addressed with diuresis for fluid overload. His
postoperative course was uneventful. He continued to require
diuresis for pleural effusion. Chest x-ray on discharge
demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions. His hematocrit on
discharge is 25.6. At this point in time , there is no need to
transfuse the patient. He is stable. Heart rate is stable. He is
on room air oxygenating at 97%. He is to be discharged to
rehabilitation on the following medications.

PROCEDURES: 9/25/2007 , therapeutic paracentesis , 4 liters of
ascitic fluid removed without complication. Chemistries and cell
counts of ascitic fluid as described above in the laboratory
section.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 63-year-old man with history of
end-stage renal disease - on hemodialysis , coronary artery
disease , diabetes , severe peripheral vascular disease status post
bilateral knee amputations , who presented with two months of
worsening ascites of unclear etiology. His hospital course by
problem is as follows:
1. Gastrointestinal: The patient underwent a therapeutic
paracentesis with ascites fluid revealing chemistries with total
protein greater than 2.5 and serum ascites albumin gradient
greater than 1.1 consistent with a transudative ascites , likely
due to volume overload with resultant right heart failure.
Ascites had 460 white blood cells with 20% polys. Therefore , it
was not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Ascitic fluids were negative for growth of bacteria and cytology
of the ascitic fluids identified no malignant cells. After
consultation with the cardiology service , it was concluded that
the ascites was due to massive volume overload , and therefore the
patient should undergo reduction of volume through
ultrafiltration at dialysis. This process was begun as an
inpatient by the renal service. While the patient was an
inpatient , efforts to remove fluid was complicated by
development of hypotension during dialysis as
well as by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
with heart rates up to the 140s. Due to the difficulties with
removing fluid at dialysis , the patient was offered the option of
undergoing ultrafiltration by CVVH or an ultrafiltration machine ,
but the patient and the family declined to participate in such
care. It should also be noted that despite our efforts , the
patient was not compliant with fluid restrictions that were put
into place in the patient's diet order , therefore also making it
difficult to treat the patient's volume overload. The patient
was discharged with the plan to continue ultrafiltration at outpatient
dialysis in an attempt to continue to remove fluid and reduce the
patient's volume overload. This plan was communicated by the
attending renal , Dr. Simon Esbrandt , to the patient's outpatient renal
attending , Dr. Archie Chhum .
2. Renal: As described above , the patient has end-stage renal
disease - on hemodialysis. As described above , ultrafiltration
was attempted at hemodialysis to remove as much fluid as possible
and to reduce the patient's volume overloaded state.
Ultrafiltration should be continued as an outpatient to continue
to attempt to counteract the patient's volume overload.
3. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , the patient has a history of
coronary artery disease status post CABG and stent , but his usual
aspirin and Plavix were initially held given that surgical
revision of his right below-the-knee amputation had been planned.
However , after discussion with the patient's vascular surgeon ,
Dr. Herb Piecuch , it was decided that the patient's volume
overload should be corrected prior to his undergoing surgical
revision of his right leg. Therefore , aspirin and Plavix were
restarted on 11/16/2007 .  Pump: The patient has evidence of
right heart failure by echocardiogram. On physical exam and as
described above , this is likely a consequence of the patient's
volume overload. Again , as described above , volume was removed
through ultrafiltration at dialysis. Rhythm: The patient has a
history of atrial fibrillation but is not anticoagulated , likely
for fear of noncompliance. The patient was in normal sinus
rhythm for the majority of this admission but on 1/8/2007 , the
patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular with
rates to the 120s to 140s. However , the patient refused to
accept monitoring on cardiac telemetry and also refused to
cooperate with the administration of intravenous medications for
heart rate control. Therefore , the patient's dose of oral
Lopressor was slowly titrated upward as tolerated by his blood
pressures , but on discharge his rate remained in the low 100s and
were not optimally controlled. However , the patient refused
further management of his atrial fibrillation , and it was
therefore decided that this should be managed as an outpatient
with continued slow readjustment of his oral beta-blocker
regimen.
4. Endocrine: The patient was continued on his home insulin
regimen and fingersticks were monitored on a q.a.c. and nightly
basis with adequate control of blood sugars.
5. Vascular: As described above , the patient has a right
below-the-knee amputation , which need surgical revision. As
described above , after discussion with the patient's vascular
surgeon , Dr. Mel Bierut , it was decided that the patient's
surgical revision of his right leg would be addressed after his
issues with volume overload are resolved.
6. Infectious disease: It was noted that the patient has as a
likely paronychia of his left index finger. Plain films were
obtained , which did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. A
hand surgery consult was obtained , and it was noted that there
were no vascular issues with his left hand and that no urgent
surgical debridement of the left finger was necessary. The
patient was treated with oral levofloxacin and will continue
taking levofloxacin for a total of 3-week course to end on
6/11/2007 .  Oxycodone was administered for pain control of his
left finger as well as for pain control of his right leg.
Prophylaxis , the patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin for
DVT prophylaxis and placed on Nexium for GI prophylaxis.
The patient was full code during this admission.
PHYSICIAN FOLLOWUP PLANS: The patient has a followup appointment
with his vascular surgeon , Dr. Huey Lamond , on 10/26/2007 at
2:30 p.m. , phone number 178-843-9703. The patient should call
his doctor his primary care physician , Dr. Jamal Gehlert ,
telephone #204-180-5657 , for appointment in two to three weeks.
The patient will continue dialysis at Gentville under the
direction of Dr. Alphonso Berwald on a Monday , Wednesday , Friday
schedule. This patient should complete a total of 14-day course
of levofloxacin to end on 6/11/2007 for his left fourth finger
paronychia/skin infection. The patient's beta-blocker should be
titrated upwards as tolerated by blood pressure for better
control of his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. As described
above , ultrafiltration should be used during dialysis to remove
total body volume.

PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Pneumonia.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. COPD.
2. Arrhythmia.
3. AVNRT/SVT.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
On admission was shortness of breath and fever.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 73-year-old male with COPD , hypertension , chronic renal
insufficiency , CHF , with ejection fraction of 60% , pulmonary
hypertension , and arrhythmias who was discharged on 5/10/05 but
returned later in the evening complaining of worsening shortness
of breath and fevers at home. On prior hospitalization , the
patient had presented on 10/10/05 with acute shortness of breath
and hypertension with chest pain and was ruled out for MI and PE.
In addition , he was treated for minor COPD exacerbation with
steroids and nebulizer but not antibiotics and was discharged on
5/10/05 at baseline home O2 of 2 liters and was afebrile. At
presentation on 9/30/05 , the patient noted worsening shortness
of breath with increasing oxygen needs and in the ED was found to
have a temperature of 102.4. On chest x-ray , the patient was
found to have left lower lobe pneumonia that had not been noted
on chest x-ray from 10/10/05 and on the PECT on 4/19/05 .  The
patient was admitted on 9/30/05 for pneumonia and increasing
oxygen requirements.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Past medical history is notable for a. fib with SVT not on
Coumadin , hypertension , COPD with home oxygen at 2 liters ,
hyperlipidemia , gout , coronary vascular disease , chronic renal
insufficiency , and type II diabetes controlled on diet.
MEDICATIONS:
His medications at time of admission included aspirin 81 mg
daily , allopurinol 100 mg daily , Lopressor 50 mg t.i.d. , the
patient was on the prednisone taper , Hytrin 2 mg daily , Zocor 40
mg q.h.s. , Flovent , Prilosec , and Atrovent.
ALLERGIES:
He has allergies to sulfa , lisinopril , and quinine causing
platelet deficiency.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient had quit cigarette and denied any alcohol or illicit
drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Physical exam at the time of admission was notable for a
temperature of 101 , blood pressure 95/53 , oxygen saturation of
86% on 2 liters , pulse of 96 , and respiratory rate of 24. The
patient was noted to have crackles with left side being greater
than right. His cardiovascular exam had normal S1 , S2 regular
rate and rhythm with no rubs , murmurs or gallops. His
extremities were notable for trace edema. Neurologically , he was
intact.
LABORATORY DATA:
His labs at time of admission was notable for a creatinine of
1.7 , and a white cell count of 16 , he had a ABG with pH of 7.42 ,
PaCO2 of 35 , PaO2 of 52 , and 89% oxygen saturation on 2 liters.
His EKG showed T wave inversions in V2-V3 , flat V4 , borderline
first-degree AV block in sinus rhythm. Chest x-ray was notable
for left lower lobe pneumonia.
ASSESSMENT:
On assessment , this is a 73-year-old gentleman recently
discharged for minor COPD flare , presenting with acute hypoxemia
likely secondary to left lower lobe pneumonia with COPD.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Pulmonary:
a. Hypoxia: The patient presented with acute and chronic
hypoxia. The patient initially required short term MICU stay for
a BiPAP and was gradually weaned to facemask over 24 hours. On
day two of admission , he was weaned to 8 liters and was
transferred to the floor where his respiratory management was
continued. On 10/4/05 , day 3 of hospitalization , the patient
had been weaned to 5 liters when he began coughing and abruptly
desaturated to 70% oxygen saturation with complaints of shortness
of breath and chest pain and required nonrebreather. The patient
had no EKG changes and a chest x-ray was unchanged from prior on
9/30/05 .  The patient was given DuoNeb and chest PT. He was
stabilized and was able to be managed on the floor and
transitioned back to 8 liters. At time of discharge , he has been
weaned to 4 liters with 91-97% oxygen saturation. The patient
does continue to desaturate with activities and requires further
pulmonary rehabilitation including chest PT to remove mucus
plugging noted on CT PE from earlier hospitalization in April .
b. Pneumonia: The patient presented with left lower lobe
pneumonia. He was started on vancomycin , ceftriaxone , and
azithromycin on 9/30/05 .  He had a sputum culture positive for
MRSA and was therefore continued on vancomycin. He was briefly
transitioned to vancomycin with ceftazidime and Flagyl from
8/14/05 to 08 , but was switched back to vancomycin with
cefotaxime and azithromycin on 5/26/05 .  On day of discharge , he
will be leaving on vancomycin to complete two more days of
treatment for a total 10-day course. In addition , he will be
discharged on Levaquin for an additional seven-day course of
treatment for his pneumonia.
c. COPD: The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation and was
most recently discharged on 5/10/05 for mild COPD exacerbation
treated with DuoNeb and steroid taper. During this hospital
course , the patient continued on DuoNeb treatments as well as a
steroid taper. Given his acute clinical course in this
hospitalization , the patient did not have pulmonary function test
performed but with benefit from PFT studies as an outpatient. At
time of discharge , the patient is on 4 liters of oxygen and is
currently on prednisone 5 mg which will be tapered to his home
regimen of prednisone 5 mg every other day.
d. Hypertension: The patient had been noted to have a pulmonary
artery pressure in 2003 in the 60s but on this admission had an
echo at time of admission that noted that his pulmonary artery
pressure was now at 98 mmHg. The patient was followed by the
Insmotho Erout Hospital Service to assess his pulmonary hypertension.
The patient will be followed as an outpatient by the
Malv Medical Center Service and will likely need right heart
catheterization to assess his right heart function as well as his
pulmonary hypertension.
2. Cardiovascular:
a. Pump: The patient has congestive heart failure with
diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction around 60% as
noted on an echo done on 9/30/05 .  The patient initially had his
Lasix held due to his creatinine of 1.7 at time of admission.
However , given his acute respiratory status , as well as his
increasing edema during his hospital course , the patient was
again aggressively diuresed for his CHF exacerbation with Lasix.
At time of discharge , the patient still has trace edema and his
creatinine has remained at his baseline of 1.1-1.2. The patient
will be discharged on his home Lasix regimen of 40 mg p.o.
although he required IV Lasix on multiple occasions during his
hospital course.
b. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension.
Overall , his systolic blood pressure remained in the range from
110-130s. The patient was on Lopressor during his hospital
course and had no acute issues regarding his hypertension.
c. Ischemia: The patient had been ruled out for MI with three
sets of negative cardiac biomarkers. He was continued on
telemetry and remained on a regimen of aspirin , beta blockers , as
well as statin during this hospital course.
d. Rate: The patient has a history of arrhythmias with
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and SVTs. At last admission on
10/10/05 , the patient presented to the ED in SVT and hypotensive
and reverted back to normal sinus rhythm after one dose of IV
Lopressor. The patient was continued on Lopressor 50 mg t.i.d.
during his hospital course with his DuoNeb treatments. The
patient did occasionally have heart rate into the 140s consistent
with AV nodal reentry tachycardia. These incidences did not last
more than 2 minutes and the patient was in general asymptomatic
from these arrhythmias although did occasionally did complain of
some shortness of breath on occasion during these periods of
arrhythmia. The patient is being continued on Lopressor 50 mg
t.i.d.
3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of type II diabetes
that was under diet control as an outpatient with steroid
treatment for his COPD exacerbation. The patient did have his
blood glucose measured regularly three times a day and required a
regular insulin sliding scale for his steroid-induced diabetes.
With tapering of the steroids , the patient's blood glucose has
generally ranged between 100-150 and has required less insulin.
While the patient is on steroids , we will continue to monitor his
blood glucose level and cover with insulin as needed. The
patient will follow up with his primary care physician and
discuss further his overall need for oral hypoglycemic agents.
4. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency with baseline creatinine around 1.1-1.2. At
initial time of presentation , his creatinine was 1.7 and his
Lasix had been held. However , the patient developed lower
extremity edema with shortness of breath and required Lasix for
his CHF exacerbation. His creatinine was followed closely during
his hospital course and with Lasix diureses his creatinine did
rise slowly to 1.4 , however , the benefits of diureses for CHF
exacerbation outweighed his chronic renal insufficiency state.
We would recommend that the patient follow up with his primary
care physician to monitor his renal state.
5. FEN: During this hospital course , the patient's electrolytes
were monitored and repleted as needed. He had no acute issues
regarding his electrolytes or nutritional status. However , the
patient should continue on low-salt 2 g sodium diet as well as
limit his fluid intake to 1.5 liters per day.
6. ID: The patient , at initial time of admission , had a
temperature of 101.2 with white cell count as high as 16. He was
found on chest x-ray to have a left lower lobe pneumonia and was
started on a antibiotic course as dictated above in pulmonary.
The patient remained afebrile through the extent of this hospital
course while on the antibiotic therapy his sputum cultures were
positive for MRSA. At time of discharge , he will be continued on
his antibiotics on vancomycin for an additional two days for a
total of 10-day course and he will also be started on Levaquin
for a seven-day course. At time of discharge , the patient
remained afebrile with his white cell count of 12.6. The patient
is on prednisone , which can slightly his overall white cell
count. The patient is aware that if he had worsening of his
sputum production as well as fevers , to seek medical attention.
7. Heme: The patient had no active issues.
8. GI: The patient had regular bowel movements during his
hospital course and deferred bowel regimen. He was on proton
pump inhibitor for prophylaxis and would be continued on this as
an outpatient.
PROPHYLAXIS:
The patient received heparin 5000 units subcutaneous t.i.d.

Discharge Date: 6/13/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CARDIOMYOPATHY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Selkirk is a 49 year old woman with
history of non ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy thought to be either familial or secondary to
alcohol use who is on the transplant list and presents with
worsening CHF symptoms.
Ms. Ohlenbusch cardiac history began in 1995 when she was admitted
with worsening dyspnea. Echocardiogram at that time revealed an
ejection fraction of 15% with global hypokinesis and 3+ mitral
regurgitation. Catheterization revealed a right dominant system
with clean coronary arteries. Exercise test at that time revealed
a peak VO2 of 12.6 liters per kg per minute. IN October of 1997 , a
repeat echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% with
moderate mitral regurgitation and significant left atrial
dilatation. At that time , she received tailored therapy with
Digoxin , diuretics and ACE inhibitors. In February of 1997 , she
was again hospitalized , this time with severe pancreatitis
resulting in acute renal failure , hypotension and respiratory
failure requiring intubation in the ICU. In April of 1997 , she
developed progressive dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and PND. In
October of 1998 , repeat echocardiogram revealed severe left
ventricular dilatation with an EF of 10 to 15% , global hypokinesis
and left atrial dilatation secondary to mitral regurgitation. She
was hospitalized most recently in August 1999 for abdominal
discomfort thought to be secondary to worsening right heart failure
and improved with aggressive diuresis.
She has done well since then until approximately three weeks prior
to admission when she developed worsening dyspnea and intermittent
tachycardia. She reports four pillow orthopnea and three nights of
PND. She becomes short of breath walking up only five stairs , and
reports approximately three weeks of a dry cough , productive
occasionally of clear sputum. She denies fever , chills , nausea ,
vomiting or diarrhea , GI , or GU symptoms.

ATTENDING: KELLIHER , ASHLEY MD
SERVICE: General Medicine Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Altered mental status.
LIST OF PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: Altered mental status , metastatic
adenocarcinoma , diabetes type 2 , history of sarcoid by report ,
status post cholecystectomy , status post laminectomy of T9
through T12.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Malloch is a 51-year-old
woman with a history of metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown
primary origin who presents as a transfer initially from Ons Hospital with altered mental status. The patient was initially
diagnosed with cancer and presenting with lower back pain in
5/15 when she was found to have lytic spinal and pelvic
lesions on MRI. Immunohistochemistry was most consistent with
pancreatic cancer origin. She was admitted to the Laso in early October for cord compression and
underwent XRT and laminectomy by orthopedic surgeon by Dr.
Kasey Mahaxay . During that admission , she was also noted to have
a large pericardial effusion and underwent pericardial window.
She was then discharged from Madei Coxcli Hospital on
7/20/06 to rehab. At rehab , the patient was noted to have
difficulties expressing herself and word finding at 01:00 a.m. on
the day of admission. Prior to this episode , she had normal
speech and mental status and it is pertinent to note that on the
day prior to admisison she had been seen in Oncology Clinic with
Dr. Randell Youkhana and hence was started on Zometa. The patient
denies any fevers , chills , neck stiffness or focal neurologic
symptoms. She was initially sent to Inh Hospital And Medical Center where a
noncontrast CT scan was done and found to be negative for an
acute process and was then admitted to General Service. At that
point , it had been over three hours since symptom onset and her
cancer further precluded any possible TPA therapy. An MRI was
then attempted to be obtained , however , the patient required
intravenous conscious sedation to attempt the MRI secondary to
agitation and anxiety. The patient received total of 2 mg of
Versed , 4.5 mg of IV Ativan and 2 mg of oral Ativan and several
attempts were made to facilitate the MRI. She was unable to sit
for MRI and was able to sit for a head CT with angiography. As
she became more and more somnolent , it was felt that additional
sedation might necessitate intubation. The Anesthesia Service
called and pointed out that the Mas MRI machine is
not compatible with intubated patients. The patient was then
transferred to Down Camp for possible MRI with
intubation. An LP at this time was also unable to be performed
secondary to her restlessness.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Metastatic adenocarcinoma , diabetes
mellitus type 2 , history of sarcoid ( although never had a
biopsy ) , status post cholecystectomy , status post laminectomy of
T9 , T11 and T12.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Lorazepam 0.5 mg q.3 h. p.r.n.
agitation , omeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily , senna two tabs p.o.
b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation , metoprolol SR 50 mg p.o. daily ,
ondansetron 8 mg p.o. b.i.d. , furosemide 20 mg p.o. daily ,
insulin sliding scale , insulin Humalog 6 units a.c. , insulin NPH
10 units b.i.d. , enoxaparin 40 mg daily subcutaneous , docusate
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation , Tylenol 650 mg q.6 h.
p.r.n. pain.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin with an unknown reaction.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature of 98 degrees , heart rate
81 , blood pressure 107/51 , respirations 20 , sating 97% on 2 L.
General exam showed a drowsy-feeling patient who was oriented x1
( not for place or time ). HEENT exam shows pupils equal , round
and reactive with no photophobia. Neck exam showed a supple neck
with no lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary exam showed lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam showed a JVP that
was difficult to assess , heart rate showed a regular rate and
rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops , distal pulses were bilateral
and 2+ and symmetric. Abdominal exam showed an obese abdomen , is
nontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities exam showed extremities warm and well perfused.
Neurologic exam showed the patient was alert and oriented only x1
with 2+ patellar reflexes , 2+ ankle reflexes and 1+ brachial
reflexes. The patient was poorly responsive to questions and
commands , hence a motor and sensory exam was unable to be
obtained , however , the patient was moving all extremities.
PERTINENT LABS ON ADMISSION: Included a negative tox screen ,
otherwise unremarkable. EKG showed sinus tach to 103 beats per
minute , slightly low voltage. Chest x-ray showed cardiac
enlargement without acute or active disease. Head CT showed no
acute intracranial abnormality noted. Urinalysis showed trace
leuk esterase , 5 to 10 white blood cells , 200 rbc's , however ,
urine culture showed no growth.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Neurologic: The patient was initially admitted to the
medical ICU for possible MRI with intubation. However , upon
arrival , the patient was alert and oriented enough to refuse the
MRI/MRA ( this was desired to rule out metastatic disease versus
leptomeningeal disease ). Because she did not require she was
then sent to the floor on 2/11/06 .  A full toxic metabolic
workup was obtained , which showed the ammonia levels within
normal limits and nonreactive RPR , B12 assay that was actually
slightly elevated and a TSH level of 10.6 ( a full thyroid panel
was also sent , which was pending at the time of discharge and
should be followed ). Given the concern for her slight pyuria on
her UA and her altered mental status she was also given a
three-day course of ciprofloxacin , however , her urinary culture
was negative. She presently , within the first 24 hours of her
stay on the floor , her mental status improved remarkably and was
at her baseline. Hence , an MRI/MRA was not performed , as this
would require the patient to undergo further sedation ( it was
felt that her significant amount of benzodiazepines that were
given previously only served to worsen her mental status ). An LP
was not indicated at this time since she had returned to her
baseline. An echo was ordered but was not performed secondary to
the fact that the patient had had a previous echo within the last
month , but was desired to rule the very small chance that she had
marantic endocarditis with embolic phenomenon. At the time of
discharge , the patient was at her neurologic baseline and was
alert and oriented x4. The likely source of her altered mental
status appears to be toxic metabolic multifactorial etiology ,
including the possibility of Zometa effect , the urinary tract
infection and possible hypothyroidism.
2. Onc: The patient has an appointment with Dr. Garrett Gavidia of
Shiresy Medical Center Oncology on 2/10/06 to initiate Gemzar
chemotherapy.
3. Ortho: The patient has a followup appointment with Dr. Maron
of Spi Medical Center Orthopedics on 8/9/06 for
further followup.
4. Endocrine: The patient will be discharged to rehab on a
regimen of Lantus and sliding scale insulin. She should have her
TFTs followed up as they are pending at this time for possible
initiation of hormone replacement.
5. ID: The patient finished a three-day course of ciprofloxacin
for possible urinary tract infection , however , her urinary
culture was negative.
6. Cardiovascular: The patient was initially transferred on
metoprolol , however , her blood pressures have been well
controlled in-house. If her blood pressures are elevated at
rehab , one could consider restarting her metoprolol.
7. Disposition: The patient was in stable condition and
discharged back to rehab for further care.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: Temperature of 98.6 , blood
pressure of 110/60 , heart rate 98 , respirations 18 , sating 99% on

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Diabetes management and teaching.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Diabetes management and teaching.
ID/CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Ms. In is a 32-year-old G6P2-0-3-2 at 22-6/7 weeks' gestational
age admitted for blood sugar control after first prenatal visit
in Special OB Clinic. Her dating is by her last menstrual
period , which was 9/26/05 , giving her an estimated date of
confinement of 2/27/05 .  An ultrasound at 14 weeks done during
an ER admission for vaginal bleeding confirmed her gestational
age. Prenatal screen were not known at the time of admission.
HISTORY OF PRESENT PREGNANCY:
Ms. Horka had been scheduled to see a midwife at Do 1 but
had been unable to keep appointment. Her pregnancy thus far has
been notable for:
1. Late prenatal care.
2. Hypertension. She has had blood pressures that were
140's/90's several months prior to pregnancy. Her blood pressure
in clinic on the day of admission was 139/79.
3. Diabetes , likely type 2 , class B diabetic. Predates
pregnancy , per the patient her blood sugars prior to pregnancy
ranged from the 120-180 range and that she reports she has never
needed to take insulin. She had a visit at Til Dr. , Burg A Rill and was
given a glucometer and known fasting sugars ranged from the
90s-140s and one hour postprandials ranged from 140-230.
4. She is a smoker.
5. History of depression. She currently takes Remeron and is
followed by her outpatient psychiatrist with whom she has had a
longstanding relationship. Given that the Remeron was a class C
medication , she was discontinued on that.
HER PAST OB HISTORY:
She had three prior first trimester TABs and two priors
spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Her largest baby was 7 pounds 12
ounces.
GYN HISTORY:
She has a history of high-grade SIL , status post colpo with
biopsies. Her last Pap was a year ago and within normal limits.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Also , notable for a history of renal stones and migraine
headaches.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
She had laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS:
Her only medication is Remeron.
ALLERGIES:
She has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She smokes approximately seven cigarettes daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Her blood pressure is 139/79. She is well appearing. Her heart
was regular rate and rhythm. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen was soft and obese. It is
difficult to assess fundal height. Pelvic exam had normal
mucosa , normal cervix. Bimanual exam revealed approximately 22
weeks size uterus with audible fetal heart tones.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Diabetes: Given the late time in the day of her appointment
and the inability to establish proper diabetic teaching as an
outpatient , she was admitted for diabetic teaching and control.
She had never previously used medications and has had reportedly
poor control with diet. Risks of diabetes were discussed. She
was started on a regimen of 14 of N q.a.m. and 14 of N at bedtime
with 6 of Humalog premeal as per Dr. Haggett . Her sugars overnight
while in-house were as follows: 100 fasting , 175 approximately
two hours postprandial , 157 and then a fasting of 94 this is
while receiving that stated insulin regimen. She was seen by the
Diabetes Management Service and Dr. Saunders on 5/10/05 who
recommended increasing her prebreakfast and predinner Humalog to
8. She will need an Ophthalmology consult as an outpatient.
Hemoglobin A1c was sent and was 5.3.
2. Hypertension: Given her elevated blood pressure of 139/79 in
clinic and her history that was notable for potentially a
longstanding hypertension , her blood pressure was monitored
closely and baseline preeclampsia labs were sent. Her blood
pressure overnight was within normal limits with values this
morning of 108/60 seated and 90/50 lying. She had a normal BUN ,
creatinine , ALT , AST , and uric acid. A 24-hour urine protein was
completed during this hospitalization and the results are pending
at the time of this dictation.
3. History of depression: Her Remeron was discontinued and I
discussed her symptoms of depression with her in greater detail.
She said that she primarily uses Remeron as a sleep aid and the
major side effect she experiences with withdrawal of Remeron is
nightmares. She does not feel as if she has a problem with
depression and declined a psychiatry consultation while in the
hospital. She has an outpatient psychiatrist whom she has a
longstanding relationship with. I advised to discuss her
pregnancy with her psychiatrist and to be in contact should she
have any concerns. She reported that she always knows if she
needs additional help and will be in contact with her doctor.
4. Fetal well-being: Baseline and prenatal laboratories were
sent on 4/19/05 .  Her blood type is B positive. Her antibody
screen was negative. Her RPR was nonreactive. Her hepatitis B
surface antigen is negative , rubella immune , gonorrhea and
chlamydia are negative. She had an ultrasound done on the
5/10/05 which revealed a singleton intrauterine gestation. Her
placenta was posterior and not previa. She had normal Dopplers
and normal fetal survey. The fetal risks of uncontrolled
diabetes were discussed and she expressed that she understood all
of these concerns.
5. Cardiac. A baseline EKG was obtained which revealed normal
sinus rhythm , normal axis , normal rate , however , her QT-interval
was slightly prolonged at 491 msec. The upper limit of normal in
women is 460. I briefly discussed this finding with the Medicine
Consult Service and Cardiology Service who felt that this is
likely attributable to her low potassium of 3.2. Therefore , high
content potassium foods were encouraged and she will have a
repeat EKG at her prenatal visit next week to evaluate for
resolution of this prolonged QT. Of note , she reports that her
mother had a congenital heart condition and experienced her first
heart attack at the age of 27 due to what she thought was an
enlarged heart. Her mother ultimately died at the age of 56 from
a heart attack. She reports aside from her mom who she does feel
had this condition since birth; no one in her family has
experienced sudden cardiac death. She also has never experienced
palpitations or chest pain.
6. History of kidney stones. A urinalysis was sent which
revealed 1-5 red blood cells and the urine culture showed 10 , 000
of mixed flora.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
Given Ms. Bruechert strong desire to be discharged after only a day
of admission , she was discharged to home with the following
instructions:
She is to take her fingerstick blood sugars fasting and at one
hour postprandial intervals and record them prior to her
follow-up appointment. She is also instructed to eat foods high
in potassium and to call the office in an urgent manner should
she develop chest pain or palpitations. She has appointments
scheduled for 6/6/04 with Dr. Gettys in special OB Clinic ,
Dr. Weisse in Endocrine Clinic and Nutrition. She was given
prescriptions for NPH to take 14 units subcu a.m. and 14 units
subcu at bedtime and Humalog 8 units prebreakfast , 6 units
prelunch , and 8 units predinner. She is also advised to take
prenatal vitamins one tablet p.o. daily. She understands all
these follow up plans and has no concerns with her discharge at
this time.

ATTENDING: KAPPLER , TRINIDAD MD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 70-year-old woman with a
history of an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction
of 35% and also a history of coronary artery disease status post
MI , insulin-dependent diabetes , peripheral vascular disease and
chronic renal insufficiency who presented with volume overloaded.
The patient was recently discharged after a 9-day admission from
6/10/2006 to 05 for a CHF exacerbation. During the
previous admission , she had been diuresed with a Lasix drip and
then started on amiodarone and Coumadin for a new paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. After discharge , she presented to NSCHC
Cardiology Clinic on 1/16/2006 with a jugular venous pressure at
15 cm and severe bilateral lower extremity edema and a BNP of
2500. The assessment in clinic was that she had been under
diuresed in the previous admission and therefore she was directly
admitted to Poredtiesbarre General Hospital for reinitiation of aggressive
diuresis. Of note , the patient had recently changed from Lasix
to torsemide after the last discharge as her outpatient
medication. She endorsed worsened orthopnea , dyspnea on
exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as well as early satiety.
She denied any chest pain or other anginal equivalents.

ALLERGIES: Lisinopril and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives at home with
her husband. She quit tobacco with rare alcohol use and no
drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. There is no family history of
cardiac disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature was 98.9 , heart
rate 70 , blood pressure 104/50 , respiratory rate of 20 , oxygen
saturation 95% on room air. In general , the patient was
comfortable in no acute distress. HEENT , Pupils were equal ,
round , and reactive. Oropharynx was clear. The JVP was greater
than 15 cm , chest exam showed bilateral crackles at the bases
with bibasilar dullness well as well as right greater than left
base. Cardiovascular was regular rate and rhythm with a S3 and
no murmur. Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended with a
nonpulsatile liver. Extremities showed 3+ pitting edema
bilaterally to the hips with bilateral changes of arterial and
venous insufficiency. Laboratory studies were significant for an
INR of 1.6 , BUN of 110 , creatinine 3 , white blood cell count of
11.7 and a hematocrit of 27.9.
EKG on admission was a normal sinus rhythm with evidence of a
previous anterior MI with lateral repolarization , ST and T wave
abnormalities , and possible LVH.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions , left greater than right
with increased vascular markings and fluid in the right fissure ,
but no discrete infiltrates.
IMPRESSION: This is a 70-year-old woman with ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 35% , coronary artery disease status
post MI , insulin-dependent diabetes , peripheral vascular disease ,
chronic renal insufficiency who presented in volume overload
after a recent admission with insufficient diuresis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular. In terms of pump , the patient was clearly in
gross volume overload from both the right sided and left-sided
failure on presentation. Her blood pressure was stable and she
had no evidence of severely decreased cardiac output or/and organ
perfusion. She was started on the Lasix drip at 10 mg per hour
and Zaroxolyn at 2.5 mg p.o. daily. Her Lopressor was held for a
decompensated heart failure. She initially diuresed well
overnight; however , on the second day her diuresis tapered off
and her Lasix drip was turned up to 20 mg per hour and the
Zaroxolyn was increased to b.i.d. She met her I&O goal of
greater than 1 liter negative overnight the following night ,
however , a day later , she again had poor diuresis and the
Zaroxolyn was changed to Diuril. At this time , a repeat chest
x-ray showed a very little change in her bilateral pleural
effusions , so her diuresis up to this point was felt to be
insufficient. After the transition from Zaroxolyn to Diuril ,
which was given 250 mg IV b.i.d. , she was noted to have an
increase in creatinine from 2.9. gradually up to 3.2; however ,
remained stable for the next few days and the patient was able to
maintain good diuresis on this regimen without bump in her
creatinine.
On 4/25/2006 , she was noted to have greatly improved lower
extremity edema and that improved lung exam and she had met her
goal weight of less than 85 kilograms. Lasix drip was
discontinued in the afternoon on 4/25/2006 and she was restarted
on her home p.o. torsemide regimen of 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 50
mg p.o. q.p.m. for anticipated discharge home on 8/13/2006 .  The
Diuril was also discontinued. The patient was anticipated to be
stable on b.i.d. torsemide and p.o. on metolazone at home. Her
new dry weight on this admission was established at 85 kilograms
and this should be at a goal for diuresis should she require
admission in the future.
She will follow up with her CSH cardiologist for further
monitoring of her volume status after discharge. In terms of
rhythm , the patient had a new presentation of atrial fibrillation
on the prior admission and was started on amiodarone and Coumadin
at that time. She was in normal sinus rhythm on presentation at
this admission and remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the
admission and was monitored on telemetry with no other events.
She was continued on her home dose of amiodarone and continued on
Coumadin; however despite the dose being decreased from her home
dose of 1 mg q.p.m. to a 0.5 mg q.p.m. , her INR continued to rise
and was eventually 3.5. Her Coumadin was discontinued. She was
recommended to be discharged off Coumadin and follow up with her
primary care provider during the week following discharge to
recheck her INR and restart her Coumadin when it falls below 2.5.
In terms of ischemia , the patient had no acute evidence of
ischemia on presentation. Denied any chest pain and had no
changes consistent with ischemia on her EKG. She was continued
on aspirin and Lipitor throughout the admission.
2. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency at
baseline. Her creatinine did increase from a baseline of 2.9 to
3.2. During this admission , however , remained stable after that
point. She continued on renally-dosed medications and actually
required repletion of both potassium and magnesium despite her
renal insufficiency throughout the admission in the setting of
aggressive diuresis. Her electrolytes were stable prior to
discharge home. She was followed by the LCH Renal Clinic with
whom she has had a previous conversations about the possibility
of hemodialysis in the future and she will see them shortly after
this discharge:
3. Pulmonary: The patient had dyspnea on exertion and bilateral
pleural effusions on her chest x-ray on admission. This was all
felt to be consistent with her heart failure. She did have no
signs or symptoms of any infectious etiology either on imaging or
as a part of her clinical picture. Her dyspnea on exertion and
her lung exam both improved with her aggressive diuresis.
4. Endocrine: The patient had erratic fingersticks early in the
admission with a very low fingerstick blood glucoses in the
morning initially , so her p.m. Lantus dose was decreased from 18
units to 16 units and the NovoLog sliding scale was started.
On 11/10/2006 , she was noted to continue to have lower sugars in
the morning , but routinely elevated sugars in the afternoon
greater than 200. She was started on q.a.c. NovoLog regimen.
However , on this regimen , she was found 1 morning to have a
fingerstick blood glucose of 33 and to be hypothermic with a
temperature of 94 taken rectally. This was thought to be
secondary to hypoglycemia which may have progressed over several
hours prior to assessment and her temperature returned to normal
at 98 after her blood glucose was aggressively repleted. It was
felt that the patient likely had decreased metabolism of her
injected insulin in the setting of worsening renal failure , so ,
her Lantus was decreased in accordance with a curbside
consultation with the diabetes management service. She will be
discharged home on a similar regimen to her home regimen simply
with a decreased Lantus dose down to 12 units nightly. She
should continue to monitor her fingerstick blood glucoses at
home. We were hesitant to change the types or timing of her
insulin during this hospitalization. I left that item to be
further managed by her primary care provider after discharge:
5. Hematologic: The patient has a chronic normocytic anemia
felt likely to be secondary to her chronic renal insufficiency.
Her iron studies were rechecked on this admission and her iron
studies were also normal. She was continued on Aranesp through
this hospitalization and she is on Procrit as an outpatient and
she will continue on that with further discussion with the GGVH
Renal Clinic after she is discharged.
6. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient was fluid
restricted to 2 liters of fluid per day p.o. and potassium and
magnesium were repleted as needed and she was maintained on a
cardiac diet. Prophylaxis was with Coumadin and Nexium.
DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will be discharged to home with VNA
services for some home physical therapy. She will follow up with
her primary care provider Dr. Bublitz at MHS and also with the
SRRH Cardiology Clinic and Renal Clinic. She should have her INR
checked within 4-5 days after discharge and her Coumadin
restarted when her INR is less than 2.5.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.
2. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.
3. Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily.
4. Folate 1 mg p.o. daily.
5. Lantus insulin 12 units subcutaneous nightly.
6. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7. Metolazone 2.5 mg p.o. daily as needed for fluid retention as
directed by your physician.
8. Multivitamin one tablet p.o. daily.
9. Torsemide 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. at 50 mg p.o. q.p.m.
10. Vitamin B12.
11. Iron.
12. Procrit 40 , 000 units subcutaneously every other week.

spironolactone , torsemide , Ativan , Zocor , and Prilosec.
ALLERGIES:
He has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He lives at home and denies alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
The patient was afebrile with the temperature of 95.8. His heart
rate was in the 90s. His blood pressure was 90/60 breathing at a
rate of 22. His room air oxygenation was 82% , but increased to
98% on 3 liters nasal cannula. He was slightly uncomfortable
sitting straight up in bed and visibly tachypnic. His lung exam
demonstrated bilateral scattered wheezes throughout the lung
fields and bibasilar crackles. His JVP was approximately 15 cm.
Heart exam reveled regular rate and rhythm with prominent S3.
Abdominal exam was nontender. His extremities had 2+ pitting
edema to the knees.
PERTINENT LABS:
On admission , he had a creatinine of 1.7 , which is at his
baseline and BUN of 46. His BNP was 2960 , CK 48 , CK-MB 1.0 , and
troponin 0.1. Hematocrit 44.5 , white count 7.8 , and D-dimer was
150. His INR was 1.3.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
The patient had a palliative esophageal stent placed on 4/5/05 .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient presented with exam and labs
findings consistent with decompensated heart failure. For this ,
he had a known ejection fraction of 20%. While he was in the
hospital , he had strict I's and O's and was diuresed with Lasix
and torsemide. His diureses was somewhat limited by systolic
blood pressure with a range of 85 to 110 during his
hospitalization. On discharge , his weight was down to 82.1 kg
and was down from 87.5 on admission. The patient did have slight
leak in his troponin of 0.1 on admission , but his EKG was
unchanged and his enzymes x3 were negative except for the
troponin , which did not trend to higher. His cardiac medical
regimen was maximized with an ACE inhibitor or statin and baby
aspirin was started on him. He was discharged home on torsemide
100 mg daily in addition to his spironolactone dose.
2. Pulmonary: The patient received Atrovent nebulizers in-house
to help with his shortness of breath. His primary etiology ,
however , was pulmonary edema secondary to decompensated heart
failure. His diuresis goal of 1.5 liter a day was achieved with
the combination of dopamine , nesiritide , and Lasix drips. He was
most responsive to combination of nesiritide and dopamine. At
the time of discharge , the patient's room air saturations were
94% with ambulatory saturations of 86%. He was therefore
discharged home with oxygen to use overnight and when
symptomatic.
3. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with diarrhea
that was felt to be related to his chemotherapy , which has been
completed two weeks earlier. Stool was sent out for C.
difficile , which was negative. His colchicine was initially held
because of his diarrhea , but the patient then developed a flare
of his gout in his right great toe. Colchicine was resumed to
treat this with good results. The patient received palliative
stent to his esophagus on 4/5/05 that is placed by Dr. Cap
without complications. The patient had plans to follow up with
is outpatient oncologist for ongoing care of his esophageal
cancer after discharge.
4. Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.7. His baseline
chronic renal insufficiency was with the creatinine of
approximately 1.3 to 1.5. At discharge , his creatinine was 1.6 ,
which has been stable throughout his entire stay. He briefly
required having a Foley catheter placed on 4/4/05 because of
urinary retention , but it was removed the next day without
difficulty and did not have problems with voiding prior to
discharge.
5. Hematology: The patient was placed on DVT prophylaxis with
Lovenox. He did exhibit some right leg edema more pronounced
than his left leg edema , but this is felt to be due to his gout
in his right great toe.
The patient was discharged to home with services and PT was
arranged to go and do a home safety evaluation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:
The patient's vital signs were stable. He was resting
comfortably in bed. Crackles in his lungs were notably
diminished from admission. He no longer was tachypnic. His
heart had a regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , occasional S3. No
murmurs. Abdomen was soft and nontender. His extremities had
trace pitting edema.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiodarone 300 mg daily.
2. Colchicine 0.6 mg every other day.
3. Digoxin 0.125 mg every other day.
4. Ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily.
5. Lisinopril 5 mg daily.
6. Ativan 0.5 mg b.i.d.
7. Spironolactone 12.5 mg daily.
8. Trazodone 50 mg at night.
9. Multivitamins one tablet daily.
10. Torsemide 100 mg daily.
11. Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d.
12. Simvastatin 80 mg at night.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was discharged to home with services. He had
instructions to follow up with his primary care doctor , Dr.
Keltt in one weeks' time.

RESTENOSIS
PROBLEM LIST: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
2. IN-STENT RESTENOSIS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Segonia is a 53-year-old female
with a cardiac history as follows. In
October of 2001 she presented with substernal chest pain and had a
positive exercise tolerance test. Cardiac catheterization at
Tormor Community Hospital revealed a 40% LAD , 50% left circumflex ,
80% RCA , and 90% RCA. Stents were placed to both the proximal and
mid RCA lesions. In August of 2001 , the patient represented with
substernal chest pain and had a positive exercise tolerance test.
Cardiac catheterization revealed in-stent restenosis. She was
treated with angioplasty and brachytherapy. In July of 2002 , she
underwent repeat cardiac catheterization for recurrent angina and
was again found to have in-stent restenosis. Again , she underwent
a angioplasty to zero percent. Later in July of 2002 , she
presented with chest pain; however , cardiac catheterization
revealed no significant stenosis. Finally , in September of 2002 , the
patient presented with her usual chest pain and a cardiac troponin
I of 0.15. MIBI showed inferior ischemia and cardiac
catheterization showed an RCA instent restenosis. She underwent
PTCA without stenting.
Today , the patient presents complaining that she has had a sharp
chest pain across the precordium with onset three days prior to
admission and was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. Her
symptoms were intermittent until the day of presentation when she
experienced 10/10 chest pain that was only partially relieved with
sublingual nitroglycerin and was associated with shortness of
breath. She presented to Vic Storgre Hospital Emergency Department
where she was given aspirin 225 mg , nitroglycerin sublingually
x one , and Plavix 75 mg x one. On presentation , her blood pressure
was 98/54 and she was given one bolus of heparin 5 , 000 units.

HOSPITAL COURSE: ( 1 ) Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted for
cardiac catheterization on 5/6/02 , which
revealed a 90% in-stent restenosis of the RCA stent. No
intervention was made at that time. Post cardiac catheterization
she was kept on Plavix , aspirin , atenolol , Zestril , lipitor , and
intravenous TNG. Because of recurrent chest pain on 8/11/02 she
was restarted on heparin. There was an attempt to wean both the
intravenous TNG and heparin on 9/4/02 with a planned transition to
p.o. Isordil. However , the patient again had chest pain at rest ,
leading to restarting of a heparin drip and intravenous TNG. There
were no EKG changes at that time and the pain was relieved by
nitroglycerin. Of note , the patient did have a small hematoma and
bruit at the right femoral artery catheterization site. Ultrasound

OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: On January , 2005 , Dr. Leslie did a
Girdlestone on May , 2005. Dr. Hepp , a left hip
hemiarthroplasty. Please see a full dictated operative notes for
details.
HOSPITAL COURSE: She is a 76-year-old female with atrial
fibrillation , dementia , and presenting with a left hip fracture
for orthopedic surgical correction on June , 2005. She had
a surgery but without complication and a postoperative course
complicated by delirium , atrial fibrillation with RVR , and new
hyponatremia.
1. Ortho: She presented with left femur hairline fracture. She
had a Girdlestone procedure performed and a left hemiarthroplasty
performed without complications. She was treated postoperatively
with cefazolin and has been discharged will be discharged on
Keflex. She developed a mild incisional cellulitis with no signs
of abscess and no fever.
2. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: She was screened preop in the determined
intermediate risk. She was given a beta-blocker for surgery and
has no signs of symptoms of ischemia throughout this
hospitalization.
B. Pump: The patient was found to be mildly hypertensive and
was started on lisinopril with good control.
C. Rhythm: The patient with known atrial fibrillation. She
developed a rapid ventricular response on postoperative day #3.
Heart rates in the 140s. Blood pressure was stable. This was
difficulty to control with IV and p.o. beta-blocker , calcium
channel blockers , and digoxin so she was IV amiodarone loaded and
is currently undergoing a p.o. amiodarone load as well. To date
on January , 2005 , she has had seven days of p.o. 400 mg t.i.d.
and with current loading plan is seven more days of 400 mg
amiodarone b.i.d. followed by 400 mg q.d. indefinitely. She is
currently weight controlled. Heart rates in the mid to low 60s.
She is getting amiodarone and Toprol-XL 300.
3. Neurology: The patient has baseline dementia and per husband
was developing delirium prior to transfer to Bingvent Medical Center .  Differential diagnosis of this delirium infection
versus medications versus electrolytes. This is also complicated
by stress of surgery. Psychiatry was consulted , and initially
she was restarted on her Cymbalta. However , this was stopped
development of hyponatremia. Postoperatively , the patient has
slowly improved in terms of mental status and this new baseline
at discharge.
4. Infectious Disease: The patient has been afebrile
throughout. There was a report of a Gram-negative UTI at the
outside hospital for which she received a course of Levaquin.
She received postop prophylaxis of cefazolin until the September , 2005 , when this was stopped. Subsequently , she had increased
her white blood cell count to 23 , but no fever. UA , chest x-ray ,
and stool for C. diff was sent and are all negative to date. Her
white count has subsequently come down to 17 on the day of
discharge , and she has remained afebrile. Keflex was restarted
given the possible incisional site mild cellulitis , and she to be
continued until the staples were out after seven days course with
improvement. The patient developed a nonbloody diarrhea on
May , 2005. C. difficile studies were sent and have come
back negative to date. She was started on prophylactic dose of
Flagyl , which will be discontinued prior to discharge.
5. Pulmonary: The patient developed pleural effusion postop but
never was compromised in terms of oxygenation or ventilation.
She is making modest improvement at discharge and was self
diuresing.
6. Fluids , Electrolytes , and Nutrition: On admission , the
patient had a sodium of 140 which seems to gradually dropped to
her course to a nadir of 119 on the November , 2005. No obvious
med changes except for the SSRI that was subsequently stopped.
She was started on free-water restriction and urine lytes were
drawn. These lytes were consistent with picture of SIADH , so
free-water restriction has worked. On the day of discharge , her
sodium is 131 , and she should be continued on free-water
restriction and recheck in a week. Otherwise , electrolytes were
repleted p.r.n. The patient was given a low fat ADA diet.
7. Endocrine. The patient's sugars are moderately well
controlled on regular insulin sliding scale. NPH insulin was
added and has been titrated up to 12 units q.a.m. with regular
insulin sliding scale for coverage on top of that. The patient
with known hypothyroidism was euthyroid on admission. TSH was
within normal limit. Her home dose Synthroid continued and
should be indefinitely.
8. Hematology: Given the patient atrial fibrillation , she had
been on Coumadin at the outside hospital; however , on
presentation , her INR was subtherapeutic at 1.2. She was put on
Lovenox prophylactic dose prior to the surgery , and following
surgery Coumadin was restarted and up titrated to 30 range. On
discharge , she was therapeutic with an INR of 2.0 , Coumadin dose
of 5 mg q.h.s. Her hematocrit has fell following the surgery ,
and she has transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells on
May , 2005. Since then , her hematocrit has increased
appropriately and she has been stable throughout her rest of
admission. On discharge , the hematocrit was 39.0.
9. Prophylaxis: Given her high risk for DVTs , the patient was
prophylactic with Lovenox while waiting for her INR to become
therapeutic. She also given pneumo boots and TED stocking.
Finally , she was given Nexium for peptic ulcer disease
prophylaxis. No consultants were called; however , the orthopedic
service initial have this patient contact would be Dr. Scott E Kercy .
At discharge , she is afebrile , T max of 97.9 , pulse between 49
and 64 , blood pressure between 98 and 120/44 to 60. She is
breathing 18 times per minute and satting between 94% and 98% on
room air. Fasting sugars have been well controlled. On exam ,
she is in no apparent distress. She is alert and oriented x2 to
place and person but not the time. She is also alert to her
situation. HEENT: Her pupils are equal and reactive to light.
She has anicteric sclerae. Chest exam , she has slightly
decreased breath sounds at the right base but no crackles or
wheezes. Cardiovascular: She has irregularly irregular S1 and
S2. No murmurs , gallops , or rubs. Abdomen: Soft and obese with
mildly distended positive bowel sounds , nontender. Extremities:
Warm and well perfused. She has left hip incision with staples
with no signs of dehiscence but a 5 cm round area of erythema
which is nontender. Neuro exam is nonfocal.

with a history of CHF , COPD on 3 to 4 liters at home , CAD , status
post CABG , PE with a recent admission for cellulitis complicated
by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation as well as
recent admission for shortness of breath and fluid overload
complicated by PE while anticoagulated leading to a pulseless
electrical activity. The patient was also admitted to DHC from
5/15/06 to 07 for respiratory distress again with fluid
overload requiring diuresis. The patient was discharged to the

ALLERGIES: None.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is homeless , but occasionally lives
with family. No tobacco history. Positive ETOH. Positive
addiction , methadone.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Vital signs stable. Cardiac ,
irregularly irregular. No murmurs , gallops or rubs. Pulmonary ,
bibasilar crackles and wheezes. Abdomen , firm , distended ,
nontender , no rebound or guarding. Lower extremities , edematous.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A1 49-year-old woman with a history of CHF ,
COPD , CAD , status post CABG , status post PE with CHF exacerbation
complicated by acute renal failure , hyperkalemia and UTI.
PLAN:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. Because of the patient's new
onset of CHF , she was ruled out for MI shortly after admission.
Serial enzymes and EKGs were negative for ischemia. The
patient's chest pain , however was not consistent with the
patient's usual cardiac pain. During her stay , the patient was
maintained on an aspirin , beta-blocker and a statin , although the
chest pain was gone on arrival to the ED. Throughout the three
months of the patient's stay , she did experience similar burning ,
substernal chest pain. EKGs and enzymes sent during these
episodes were always negative for ischemia. It was felt that
this pain was likely secondary to GERD , as it often responded to
Maalox , benzo , lidocaine and/or food.
2. Pump: The patient's primary symptoms of shortness of breath
likely due to fluid overload. The patient was diuresed with IV
Lasix on the medicine floor. However , on 10/22/06 , the patient
experienced somnolence , low respiratory rate and desaturations in
the setting of opioid administration for pain. The patient
responded partially to Narcan and was transferred to the CCU for
three days for increased monitoring and continuation of diuresis
with a goal of negative 2 liters per day. The patient was
transitioned off methadone and on to oxycodone p.r.n. The
patient was maintained on BiPAP and given albuterol and DuoNeb
inhalers. She passed through this acute decompensation with no
further complications and was transferred back to E on
7/7/06 .  On the floor , the patient was transitioned to p.o.
Lasix. She was diuresed with a goal of 1 to 1.5 liters per day.
IV Lasix were administered p.r.n. shortness of breath/physical
exam consistent with fluid overload. One week prior to transfer ,
the patient was transitioned back to IV Lasix as her daily output
had slowed on p.o. Lasix , she was unable to make TBB goals. On
transfer , the patient shows signs of fluid overload , lower
extremity edema at bedtime BiPAP requirement , but relatively
while pulmonary compensation. The patient's dry weight is about
200 pounds.
3. Rhythm: The patient has a history of afib. She was rate
controlled with Lopressor and verapamil. She was also
anticoagulated for both her afib and a recent PE with an INR goal
of 2 to 3. Rate control was obtained with the beta-blocker and
calcium channel blocker. During the stay , the patient's heart
rate is often slightly faster than goal ranging in the 90s to
110s. Further rate control is limited by the patient's BP with
systolics often in the 90s to 100s. The patient was begun on
verapamil , which was titrated up with her beta-blocker , which was
titrated down. On transfer , the patient was on verapamil 60 mg
p.o. t.i.d. and atenolol 70 mg p.o. daily.
4. Pulmonary: The patient's pulmonary issues as described
above. The patient also has a history of PE and COPD/asthma.
Post MICU , the patient was maintained on 4 to 5 liters oxygen by
nasal cannula and during the day with BiPAP at nighttime. The
patient's O2 requirement remained stable until transfer , although
requiring albuterol nebs p.r.n. The patient was kept on Coumadin
for PE with an INR goal of 2 to 3.
5. Renal: The patient's baseline creatinine was 0.8. On
admission , the patient had ARF felt to be due to CHF/volume
overload leading to poor cardiac output , decreasing perfusion to
the kidneys. As the patient was diuresed , her renal function
improved. This was stable throughout her stay until 10/24/06
when her creatinine began to rise. It was felt that this was due
to a combination over diuresis leading to a prerenal state. No
medication changes have been made near that time except for Lasix
p.o. to IV. In the setting of creatinine bump , Lasix and
spironolactone were discontinued on 10/12/06 .  On 10/25/06 , Lasix
20 IV daily was restarted because of an improving creatinine , but
again held when creatinine returned as 1.5. On transfer , the
patient not on Lasix secondary to creatinine bumps/ARF. We did
not hydrate but monitor creatinine and continue diuresis when
able. Likely prerenal secondary to intravascular depletion
caused by liver cirrhosis leading to poor intravascular
albumin/osmotic pressure. In the setting of discontinuing of
Lasix and poor renal function , the patient did become
hyperkalemic x2 during the week of transfer. The patient did not
initially respond to Kayexalate and lactulose , as she did not
have a bowel movement likely due to opioid use. The patient did
respond to insulins and D50. On 5/30/06 , the patient again had
the elevated potassium to 5.5 , Kayexalate and lactulose x2 ,
produced two bowel movements lowering her K appropriately.
6. ID: During the stay , the patient was treated for UTI with a
three-day course of levofloxacin. Upon discharge , the patient
was asymptomatic.
7. GI: The patient was known to have vascular ectasias in her
stomach. The patient is still guaiac positive during her stay
with no active bleeding. Complicating this is the patient's need
for anticoagulation secondary to recent PE and afib. This is
felt to be the cause of her slowly dropping hematocrit for which
she required occasional weekly transfusions of packed red blood
cells. The patient on a PPI b.i.d. The patient also has
cirrhosis leading to poor synthetic function , poor intravascular
osmotic pool contributing to fluid overload.
8. Heme: As above , the patient required several transfusions of
TIBCs , although no more than once every one to two weeks. Felt
due to slow GI losses.
9. Endocrine: During the patient's stay , she was on a basal
Lantus with Aspart coverage. This was titrated up to achieve
good glycemic control. On discharge , the patient was on Lantus
42 units subcu at bedtime and Aspart 10 units a.c./h.s. with an
Aspart sliding scale. This achieved fingerstick glucoses of 120s
to 160s.
10. Psych: The patient has a history of addiction and came to
SMH on methadone. During the patient's stay , methadone was
tapered and the patient transitioned to oxycodone. The patient
often complained of back pain and burning foot pain felt to be
neuropathy , which was relieved by opioids. The patient often
refusing NSAIDs. On transfer , the patient was on oxycodone 5 to
10 mg p.o. q. 6 h. p.r.n. pain , often taking 10 mg x4 a day. The
patient also complaints of anxiety and insomnia for which 0.5 mg
of Ativan achieved good resolution. At transfer , the patient was
not on standing Ativan just requiring occasional one-time orders
at bedtime. Neurontin was also titrated up during the patient's
stay. Finally , the patient was started on nortriptyline at
bedtime for pain with good effect.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: The patient was alert and oriented
x3 sitting up in a cardiac chair , able to walk to the bathroom
unassisted. Off of O2 , although does experience mild shortness
of breath. Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Cardiovascular ,
irregularly irregular with no murmurs , gallops or rubs.
Pulmonary , faint bibasilar crackles and no wheezes. Abdomen ,
distended and nontender. Extremities , warm , well perfused with
dressings on the lower calf , which are clean , dry and intact.
Neuro , cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact. Strength
5/5 throughout with no sensory deficits.

19. Sarna topical daily.
20. Verapamil 60 mg p.o. t.i.d.
21. Coumadin 3.5 mg p.o. q.p.m.
TO-DO PLAN: To accepting MD.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
1. Fluid balance. The patient is still volume overload with a
baseline weight at 200 pounds , however , the patient
intravascularly dry likely secondary to cirrhosis. Discharge
diuresis was limited by acute renal failure likely prerenal. The
patient has received packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit
and for colloid fluid resuscitation. The patient responds to
Lasix 40 mg IV or 80 mg p.o. Please continue when renal function
improves.
2. Electrolytes. The patient hyperkalemic twice this week
secondary to poor urine output and acute renal failure , responds
to lactulose and K. The patient's EKG was unchanged.
3. GI bleed. The patient has vascular ectasias in her GI tract ,
however , she is on Coumadin for afib and PE. She is on Nexium 40
mg p.o. b.i.d. and her stools are guaiac positive.
4. Heme. The patient has a slowly dropping crit , might be
secondary to the slow GI bleed. Transfused with a goal
hematocrit greater than 25. Her INR goal is 2 to 3.
5. Physical therapy has worked with the patient and she is able
to get out of bed to the bathroom by herself , though slowly.
6. Pulmonary. The patient is on BiPAP at night , able to secure
facemask on by herself. She is on 4 to 5 liters of nasal cannula
during the daytime , though she often takes , but removes the
oxygen.
7. Psych/Pain: The patient is on oxycodone at minimum , has
received 10 mg x3 a day , now at 4 to 5 per day. The patient is
full code.

Discharge Date: 10/4/2006
ATTENDING: DRAPEAU , TRINIDAD MD
DISPOSITION:
To home with VNA service.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Status post MVP with 30 Cosgrove ring , AVR with a 25 CE and PFO
closure and MAZE.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
Hypertension , diabetes mellitus type 1 , gout , paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation , prolapse mitral valve with moderate MR.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with past medical history
significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation , severe aortic stenosis and moderate MR. His
symptoms also consisted of dyspnea on exertion. He states that
he gets short of breath walking on an incline after one to two
blocks. He has no angina , orthopnea , no neurologic symptoms.
Stress echo on 8/10/06 showed no evidence of ischemia but
importantly a fall in BP with exercise and was not able to go
beyond 2.5 minutes due to fatigue. Echo also demonstrated an
aortic stenosis with a neck area of 0.9 cm2 with a peak gradient
35 , mean of 21 , and a junctional moderate MR from myxomatous
prolapse. Cardiac cath at GMH on 3/4/06 showed single-vessel
CAD involving LAD. The patient was initially scheduled to
undergo AVR , plus MVP and MAZE on 1/26/06 .  Preop chest x-ray
revealed pulmonary fibrosis and mild pulmonary edema , which was
also confirmed with CT of chest without contrast. PFTs were
suggestive of restrictive lung disease. Pulmonary service was
consulted and it is considered that the patient's fibrosis has
not progressed and that new chest x-ray changes may be likely due
to his interstitial pulmonary edema. It was suggested that the
risk of pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery would be
moderate. Carotid ultrasound showed 65-70% RCA occlusion , which
is asymptomatic. The patient is rescheduled for AVR , plus MVP
and plus MAZE on 5/5/06 .

ID: No issues.
Transferred to the Stepdown Unit where he
proceeded to progress well. Postop day #2 , chest tubes removed
wires left in. Postop day #3 , slow junctional rhythm with rates
in the 40s being externally V paced , rate of 88 and wires not
working. EP states if further rhythm is not recover by postop
day #4 to #5 to reconsult. Foley reinserted for retention of 400
mL output. Started Flomax. On low-dose Coumadin for MVP/MAZE in
case pacemaker was needed. We will need rehabilitation upon
discharge. Post-day #4 remains to be V paced with junctional
rhythm. The wires are in and do not conduct or capture. EP
feels the patient may require pacemaker , we will observe for now.
Upper extremity noninvasive studies for left greater than right
arm swelling , negative for DVT. Holding Coumadin pending
possible pacemaker placement. Past video swallow today for
regular diet.
Postop echo pending for MVP. Rehabilitation when medically
ready. Postop day #5 , postop showed slow junctional rhythm with
EP following for possible pacemaker , and they set a pacemaker at
heart rate of 40. The patient in junctional rhythm/afib , heart
rate in the 60s , A wire and do not conduct or capture. V wire
set at a backup rate of 40. EP just came by and feels patient is
likely recovered conduction. Possibly an atrial fibrillation
versus accelerated junctional with heart rates in the 80s and
thinks pacemaker will not be indicated. Plan to discontinue
wires in a.m. if the patient's rhythm remain stable.
Postop echo done for MVP. EF 55% , No comment on MR. Foley
discontinued last night after insertion voiding well today on
Flomax. Low-dose Lovenox anticipate eventual discharge to
rehabilitation on Lovenox/Coumadin and bridge after pacemaker.
White count up slightly to 11.1 low-grade temps. UA negative.
Rehabilitation when medically ready given possibility of
pacemaker requirement. Postop day #6 , spoke with EPS as the
patient is in stable sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block ,
okay to remove wires implanted for pacemaker , ambulating well for
room air. We plan to send to rehab when bed available. Postop
day #7 , the patient was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery Service to
be stable to discharge to home with VNA service with the
following discharge instructions.
DIET: Low-cholesterol , low saturated fat. ADA 2100 calories per
day.

Discharge Date: 1/25/2003
ATTENDING: DORIAN GENEREUX MD , PHD
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Muschaweck is an 80-year-old woman
with known history of congestive heart failure and flash
pulmonary edema who presents with gradually increasing shortness
of breath for 2 weeks. Patient denies any chest pain , nausea ,
vomiting , palpitations or syncope. She does acknowledge sitting
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for approximately 48
hours before admission , no lower extremity edema. She denies any
changes in diet or changes in medical adherence. She states her
weight has been about constant at 180 pounds on her home scale.
She does note that she has poor exercise tolerance at baseline
but even now unable to perform activities of daily living for 48
hours , so she came to the Istbern Sentne Emergency Department with her
daughter. She was found to be hypertensive , hypoxic with
clinical and chest radiographic evidence of congestive heart
failure. She was treated with oxygen , IV Lasix and nitro-paced
in the ER and admitted for further treatment of her CHF
exacerbation. Her physical exam revealed a heart rate of 52
beats per minute , respiratory rate of 20 , blood pressure of
176/74 , and she was satting 97% on 4 L of oxygen. The patient
was in no acute distress , she is pleasant , a little overweight ,
alert and oriented times person , place and time. Her jugular
venous pressure was approximately 12 cm of water. She did have
pulses parvus et tardus , no Kussmaul sign. She had rales
one-half way up the pulmonary fields bilaterally. Her heart was
regular rate and rhythm , bradycardic. There was a 3/6 systolic
murmur with a slurred S2. Her abdomen was benign. She had no
lower extremity edema. She had cool extremities and neurologic
exam , other than patient being alert and oriented , was nonfocal
with no motor deficits.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Revealed a sodium of 142 , potassium 4.2 ,
chloride 105 , bicarb 26 , BUN 31 , a creatinine 1.9 , a glucose of
152. A white count within normal limits , a hematocrit of 41.8 , a
platelet count of 289 , calcium 8.8. Her coags revealed a PTT of
32.7 , an INR of 3.2 , her creatine kinase was 41 , her MB fraction
was 1.9 , her troponin was negative. Her BNP , brain natriuretic
peptide , was 885. Her chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary
edema. Her EKG showed sinus bradycardia at
48 beats/minute. No significant ST or T-wave abnormalities. No
significant from change from 1/8 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Patient has known aortic stenosis with an
AVA of 1.0. She has coronary artery disease status post acute MI
in 2001 , status post two-vessel CABG , she had the left internal
mammary to the LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the OM-2. She
has atrial fibrillation , for that she is on amiodarone and
Coumadin. She has diabetes mellitus. She has
hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease ,
bladder cancer status post resection.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Amiodarone 300 mg each day.
2. Aspirin 81 mg each day.
3. Lasix 120 mg by mouth twice a day.
4. Zestril 40 mg po each day.
5. Zocor 40 mg p.o. every night before bedtime.
6. Niferex 150 mg twice a day.
7. Insulin NPH 48 units in the morning and 4 units in the
evening.
8. Levoxyl 25 mcg each day.
9. Coumadin 2.5 mg on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , and 3 mg on
Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday , Sunday.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She denied all vises , such as tobacco , alcohol or
drugs. She lives with her daughter , Severi .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As in HPI , no fever , chills , rash , medications
changes or urinary symptoms.
ASSESSMENT ON ADMISSION: She was an 80-year-old woman with known
coronary artery disease here with a chief complaint of worsening
shortness of breath consistent with congestive heart failure
exacerbation most likely left-sided diastolic dysfunction. There
was no clear etiology , however , dietary or medication issues were
not likely given the patient's excellent awareness and
involvement in her care. The suspicion was that the patient may
have had increasing blood hypertension out of control , increasing
oxygen demand and creating diastolic function and pulmonary
edema. The role of her aortic valve was unclear , however , there
may have been gradual progression and renal artery stenosis
cannot be rule out as an etiology.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: In terms of her cardiovascular system , she
was diuresed with IV Lasix and her electrolytes were followed
closely. She came in with a weight of 84.7 kg and left with a
weight of 83.7 kg. For two days in the middle she was diuresed
with IV Lasix
120 mg b.i.d. and she was converted to oral Lasix and actually
continued her diuresis , in fact after pacemaker placement , which
will be noted below , she may have actually continued to urinate
even more so on the last day of her admission. Her blood
pressure was stable throughout her stay , in the low 100s ,
consistently below 150 systolic and above 100 systolic.
Rhythm: In terms of her rhythm , she was found at several points
throughout her stay in the first several days to have bradycardia
consistent with junctional rhythm and because of her atrial
fibrillation treated with amiodarone; it was thought she would
benefit from a pacemaker also because of her beta-blocker. So , a
pacemaker was placed on 6/21/2003 without complications. The
pacemaker was a dual-chamber PPM. Her INR before it was placed
was 1.7 , and there was some oozing from the site , however , her
hematocrit was stable and her hemodynamics were stable for 24
hours after the procedure. Electrophysiologists analyzed the
device and found that it was working properly. She is scheduled
for follow up with Dr. Gutirrez on 4/13/2003 at 9:40 in the
morning. She has been advised to limit her driving until that
appointment. She has also been advised that she will not be able
to have an MRI in the future. She will be discharged on Keflex
( cephalexin ) 250 mg p.o. 4 times a day for 3 days on discharge
for her pacemaker and if she has any problems at all with her
pacemaker she should call Dr. Richel at
telephone # ( 851 ) 491-7503 , adetc # 33243.
2. Pulmonary: The patient had PFTs done in 9/18 which showed
an FVC of 73% of predicted , FEV1 of 77% of predicted , and FEV1 to
FVC ratio of 108% , and FEF 25/75 of 80% , a TLC of 50% of
predicted , an SVC of 73% of predicted , a residual volume of 40%
of predicted , and an RV/TLC of 72% of predicted. Her DLCO
uncorrected was 44%; her DLCO corrected was 44%. During her
stay , patient had low O2 saturations at rest ranging from the
high 80s to the low 90s , but often below 88% and on exertion
consistently in the mid-80% range , not depending on where the
probe was placed. She was unable to be weaned from the oxygen
and will be sent home on oxygen. She should be followed up with
a CT of the chest. A CT of the chest was done on this admission ,
however , it was consistent with CHF and other things could not be
ruled out. Of note , on the chest CT there were found to be liver
lesions which will be commented on below. The patient should
also be worked up for her pulmonary issues.
3. Radiology: The patient had this chest CT which showed
multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities in the lungs , diffuse
haziness , some septal thickening with slight basil predominance ,
multiple borderline mediastinal nodes in the anterior
mediastinum , an AP window region with the largest node on image
21 measuring 1.3 x 2 cm , there were extensive vascular
calcifications , cardiomegaly with multi-chamber enlargement and
particularly dense coronary calcifications , trace right and left
pleural effusions. Visualized organs of the upper abdomen
demonstrate multiple ill-defined low attenuation foci in the
liver but no other abnormality. Review of bone window shows
extensive thoracic degenerative change , sternal wires and
epicardial pacer leads. The lung findings were consistent with
cardiomegaly and CHF , but could not rule out other diagnostic
possibilities including atypical pneumonia , hypersensitivity ,
pulmonary hemorrhage or less likely lymphangitic tumor. In order
to workup the liver mass , an ultrasound of the abdomen was
attained. The liver showed a mass 2.9 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm , it was
hyperechoic in the posterior segment of the right lobe of the
liver corresponding to the dominant mass seen in the CT of
7/21/203 and 11 , gallbladder was normal with no stones ,
the biliary tree was normal , as were the right kidney and left
kidney , pancreas , although it was poorly visualized. The spleen
was normal , the aorta was normal , pleural effusion was noted on
the left which was small and prominent hepatic veins were noted.
The radiologist's impression was that the ectogenic mass on the
right lower lobe of the kidney corresponded in the location of
the mass reported on prior CTs , may be a hemangioma or other
ectogenic masses which could not be excluded and he noted that
the patient could not hold her breath sufficiently well to
evaluate the mass with Doppler. If indicated , the PMD should
either get a nuclear scan , CT , the radiologist suggested MRI but
that is now impossible given the pacemaker , for confirmation and
further evaluation. Also , it was noted that she had prominent
hepatic veins possibly due to the right heart failure.
OTHER ISSUES:
4. Endocrine: The patient was continued on her Levoxyl 25 and
her home dose of insulin with good blood sugar controls generally
below fingerstick of 200.
5. Heme: The patient was continued on her Niferex. Her
hematocrit was stable throughout her stay with her admission
hematocrit being 41.8 and discharge hematocrit being 38.8. Her
white count also was not elevated. She is discharged with a
white count of 6.8. Her INR on admission was 3.2 , her Coumadin
was held and 1 mg of vitamin K was given before her procedure.
Her INR on the day of the procedure , 6/21/2003 , was 1.7 and on
discharge it was 1.3. She will be reinstituted on her same
Coumadin level , to follow up with Dr. Garder and to have her
Coumadin level checked on 5/25/2003 and be followed as she was.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: As admission medicines except #1 , she will
be taking cephalexin for 3 days and that is the only difference.
Her primary care doctor can consider can titrating her CHF
medicines and/or her hypertension medicines.

A/P: 77F w ho CAD p/w chest pain of sudden onset: Original ddx includes
acs/usa/PE/hypertensive urgency or emergency/msk/chf. Given the excellenet
response to heparin and a negative cardiac catheterization , and the
continuoation of pain despite control of hypertension , the cardiac team
felt that the most likely diagnosis was a pulmonary embolism. However , had
neg lenis and PE CT , so unlikely PE. She was discharged home with follow up
with Dr. Sollitto and with her usual PCP. Will need monitoring of lytes and
Cr given possibility of contrast induced nephropathy in setting of
underlying elev Cr.
**CV: ( i ): Chest pain was initially concerning for ischemic pain;
however , cardiac catheterization was unchanged from prior cath. She
will continue asa/plavix/BB/statin; she ruled out for MI w serial
enzymes and ekgs. Given an intermediate to high probability story
and an intermediate V-Q scan , she was continued on heparin and PE protocol
CT of chest was obtained , which was neg for PE but showed a pulmonary
nodule; she will need repeat CT for nodule f/u in 6-12 months. Excellent
oxygentation , stable walking and nearly pain free at time of discharge.
( r ): no active issues , telemetry monitoring was nl.
( p ): HTN , w ss , uptitrated labetalol for BP.
**PULM: PE intermediate pretest prob - elev d dimer but no ekg changes , no
o2 req , no known ca , no obvious dvt risks. lenis negative , PE CT neg , so PE
considered unlikely , will not anticoagulate. Pulm nodule on CT , will need
6-12 month f/u scan. Of importance however , has
pulm hypertension that is new on R heart cath and given no other
explanation for sudden pressure changes ( impressively higher since last
cath ) , may have primary pulm HTN. Given ground glass in lungs and pulm
nodule , should have outpt pulm eval for pulm parenchymal disease in near
future.
**endo: DM on 70/30 at home. Poor control given HbA1c elev and high
finger sticks in house. Chgd to nph and short acting pre-meal insulin for
tight control. Pt agreed to incr freq of SC insulin for tight control ,
still high sugera in house. Wanted to send with NPH and short acting pre-meal
regimen but pt refused to change home regimen despite repeated explanations
of value of tighter control. Agreed that she would return to home regimen of
70/30 and f/u ASAP with Dr. Douglas Tippett of Endocrinology to optimize
insulin regimen; also should f/u with outpt pcp for titration. H/o
hypothyroidism. TSH elevated; gave script for

ATTENDING: MULLALY , DOMINIQUE THEO MD
This is an interim dictation from 7/3/06 through 04 while
the patient was on the General Medicine Service.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease likely due to her
diabetes mellitus. The patient's postoperative course was
significant for contrast induced oliguric acute renal failure. A
renal consult was obtained on 2/6/06 and the patient was seen
by Dr. Studdard to evaluate her acute on chronic renal failure.
Dr. Cowlin that her acute renal failure may be due to chronic
kidney disease from renovascular disease or possibly due to
interstitial nephritis in the setting of a drug allergy. The
patient was also seen by Dr. Shope , Erik Garret Manuel F.
from the Nephrology Department while she was an inpatient. After
consideration of possibilities causing her acute renal failure ,
it was thought that her acute renal failure was most likely due
to cholesterol emboli syndrome given her eosinophilia , stepwise
progression of renal impairment and her chronic course. The
patient will need to be followed by a nephrologist as an
outpatient. In addition ,
the patient has known renal artery stenosis that may have
contributed to her acute renal failure and she did have a
possible drug allergy to diuril and perhaps a component of her
renal failure was also due to acute interstitial nephritis. On
1/27/06 , the patient developed gross hematuria. At this time ,
the urinalysis showed red blood cells but no evidence for
ATN. This gross hematuria was in the setting of a
worsened coagulopathy. She had a renal ultrasound at that time
that was negative for renal obstruction. Gradually with
resolution of her coagulopathy , the patient's urine output
increased and her creatinine improved with supportive measures
alone. The patient did have gradual improvement in her urine
output and her creatinine decreased to 2.8 prior to discharge.
The patient is currently off diuretics at this time. Daily
weights should be checked and if her weight increases by more
than 3 pounds Dr. Bockoven should be notified. The patient was also
started on calcitriol given elevation of parathyroid hormone.
Cardiovascular: Rate and rhythm: The patient has a history of
atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. The
patient was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.6 h. for rate
control , however , this dose was decreased to 12.5 mg p.o. twice a
day , given some bradycardia on her telemetry. The patient was
also started on Flecainide 75 mg p.o. q.12 h. She will continue
on these two medications upon discharge.
Congestive heart failure: The patient had evidence for
congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension during this
hospitalization. The patient did become volume overloaded on
physical examination with an oxygen requirement , elevation of her
JVP and shortness of breath. She was diuresed with Lasix during
her postoperative course. The patient was transferred to the
medical Service on 2/10/06 for management of her renal failure
and volume overload. The patient did undergo a trial of renally
dosed dopamine to see if this medication improved her cardiac
output and renal function. The patient showed no improvement on
this medication and it was discontinued after a short trial. The
patient's diuresis was discontinued prior to discharge as the
patient did have acute worsening of her renal function , which may
have been related to over aggressive diuresis. The patient was
instead started on spironolactone for management of her
congestive heart failure. As stated above , she should have daily
weights checked.
Ischemia: The patient has no history of coronary artery disease.
She was maintained on aspirin , statin and a beta-blocker during
the admission.
Hematology: The patient was started on iron supplementation for
her anemia in the setting of chronic kidney disease. The
patient's Coumadin was held briefly in the setting of a
coagulopathy that she developed on 1/27/06 .  The patient was
evaluated by the Hematology Service and was seen by Dr. Codilla and
Dr. Vallas from the Hematology Service for workup of her
coagulopathy. The patient had elevation of her INR to 5.8 and a
slight reduction in her hematocrit to 25 , as well as elevation of
her PTT to 97. Workup included factor 7 level , mixing study ,
anticardiolipin antibody , lupus anticoagulant , Von Willebrand's
panel , hepatitis B and C testing as well as complement levels.
The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells as well
as 2 units of FFP on 1/27/06 as well as vitamin K with much
improvement in her coagulopathy and increase in her hematocrit to
about 29. The patient should not receive any
heparin flushes. The patient showed no evidence for DIC or
hemolysis. Her coagulopathy was most likely thought to be due to
residual Coumadin with factor deficiency in the setting of her
decreased renal clearance. At this time , the results of the
inhibitor screen are pending and should be followed up as an
outpatient. The patient was restarted on Coumadin prior to
discharge. Her INR goal is 2 to 3 and her Coumadin dosing should
be monitored by Dr. Hynum . Her current Coumadin dose is 1 mg
p.o. once every evening and her most recent INR 1.2. The patient
will follow up with Hematology as an outpatient.
Infectious Disease: The patient had a wound culture that grew
pseudomonas for which she was briefly treated with a course of
ceftazidime. The patient completed a course of ceftazidime and
remained afebrile off antibiotics with no signs of active
infection. A wound care consult was obtained for the patient's
decubitus ulcer. She should have DuoDERM dressing applied every
three days to her ulcer.
Pulmonary: The patient continues to have an oxygen requirement
despite diuresis. She did not show clinical signs of pneumonia.
Her oxygen requirement is thought to be due to atelectasis ,
deconditioning , as well as her known congestive heart failure and
likely pulmonary hypertension. She requires supplemental oxygen
at 2 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations in the
mid 90s. This should be continued at her rehabilitation.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and was
followed by the Diabetes Nursing Service during her stay. She
was on Avandia during the admission in addition to Lantus and
NovoLog before meals. Upon discharge , the patient will be on
Avandia 4 mg p.o. every noon as well as NovoLog 4 units
subcutaneous before every meals in addition to a NovoLog sliding
scale. The patient was also started on thyroid supplementation
and will be on Synthroid as an outpatient.
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient had hyponatremia
thought to be in the setting of volume overload and total body
water excess. This improved somewhat with diuresis. In
addition , the patient developed dysphagia with liquids during her
hospitalization. She was evaluated by the Speech and Swallow
Service and had evidence of aspiration on bedside swallow
examination as well as video swallow examination. The patient
was also evaluated by the ENT Service and was seen by Dr.
Cassetty on 11/26/06 .  On laryngoscopy , she was found to have a
left vocal cord paralysis. She underwent MRI imaging of her neck
and chest. She did not have any evidence of mediastinal mass and
no abnormalities of the recurrent laryngeal nerve were seen.
Gradually , the patient has had some mild improvement in her
hoarseness and dysphagia. She benefits from turning her head to
the left with each swallow to minimize the risk of aspiration.
The patient was also followed by the Nutrition Service throughout
her hospital stay.
Vascular: The patient is status post left femoral distal bypass
on 8/21/06 .  The patient continued to be followed by the
Vascular Surgery Service during her hospitalization. She should
have three t.i.d. wet-to-dry dressings applied to her left lower
extremity up to her thigh daily. She will follow up in Vascular
Clinic with Dr. Skreen in two weeks upon discharge.
Allergy: The patient had a DIURIL induced drug rash. She showed
no signs of mucous membrane involvement and no signs of
Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on a PPI as well as her
Coumadin.
Disposition: The patient was followed by the Physical Therapy
Service while an inpatient and will benefit from inpatient
rehabilitation.

ATTENDING: REOPELL , ROLF M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
This is the diagnosis responsible for causing the admission is
sinus arrest with apnea.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of nonischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy ( EF of 55% on this admission , although
prior admission indicating an EF of 35% ) , diabetes , obstructive
sleep apnea , obesity hypoventilation syndrome , atrial flutter
status post ablation. On 5/24/05 , he presented with shortness
of breath as well as a witnessed apneic episode. His recent
history is significant for having stopped his Lasix dose one week
prior to admission due to increased frustration with
incontinence. Since then , he has had increasing shortness of
breath , orthopnea , bilateral lower edema , and dyspnea on exertion
to the point of symptoms upon walking 10 feet. In the Centsshealt Careman Inerist Medical Center Emergency Department , he was found to be
saturating 91% on room air and 99% on a nonrebreather. An ABG
showed a pH of 7.31 and a PCO2 of 55; he was tried on BiPAP
without improvement in either PCO2 or PO2. While being
interviewed by the medical residents , he was seen to have a
30-second apneic episode with loss of consciousness and cyanosis;
his sensorium quickly returned after this event , although he
retained no memory of this occurrence. He received Lasix 80 mg
x1 , Solu-Medrol , and DuoNebs in the ED. He was admitted to the
CCU initially with CHF/apnea/sinus arrest , and subsequently
transferred to the hospital floor when he was stable.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Congestive heart failure , nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy ,
2/13 echo with an EF of 35% and global left ventricular
hypokinesis; 7/18 echo with an EF of 55% , without hypokinesis.
2. Atrial flutter , status post ablation ( 2003 ).
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Hyperostosis frontalis.
5. Complex renal cyst versus angiomyolipoma , resected via
laparoscopy in 8/2 .
6. Morbid obesity with obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
7. Obstructive sleep apnea.
8. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline creatinine 2 ).
MEDICATIONS:
1. Allopurinol.
2. Iron.
3. Lisinopril.
4. Toprol-XL.
5. Coumadin ( discontinued on 11/28/05 ).
6. Albuterol inhaler p.r.n.
7. Aspirin.
8. Flomax.
9. Hytrin.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient lives alone at Rys Ville Santster He is a retired Burg Bovalle Ge
employee. He is an ex-smoker , quit in the 1960s. He is a heavy
drinker in his 20s , but now he rarely drinks alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Gastric cancer in his father.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature of 96 , pulse of 53 , blood pressure of 125/65 , and
saturating 94% on 2 liters by nasal cannula. In general , alert
and oriented , in no acute distress. HEENT: Pupils are equally
round and reactive to light , sclerae are anicteric , moist mucous
membranes. Cardiovascular exam: Regular rate and rhythm , normal
S1 and S2 , although JVP difficult to assess due to body habitus.
Lung exam: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no wheezes or
crackles. Abdomen: Obese , soft and nontender , normal abdominal
bowel sounds. Extremities: 2+ edema.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:
Notable for creatinine of 2.3 ( at baseline ) , BNP of 500. His
admission EKG: Sinus rhythm with occasional bradycardia to the
40s , no ST changes.
SUMMARY OF THE HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE:
Assessment and Plan: A 71-year-old female with a history of
obesity hypoventilation syndrome , restrictive lung disease ,
diabetes , nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with a preserved EF ,
who was admitted for congestive heart failure , sinus arrest ,
ultimately treated with diuresis and a pacemaker placement.
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: No active issues during this
hospitalization. Pump: The patient had a history nonischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy with a preserved EF , ( an echo during this
hospitalization revealed an EF of 55% without hypokinesis ,
although prior echo in 2003 showed an EF of 35% with global left
ventricular hypokinesis ). On admission , the patient had signs
and symptoms of volume overload in a setting of having not taken
his Lasix for about a week. He was admitted initially to the
CCU , and subsequently transferred to the floor , with aggressive
diuresis of approximately 10 kg since admission ( including
diuresis with ultrafiltration in the CCU ). Following transfer to
the floor , he was switched to Lasix diuresis , which was titrated
down gradually to 40 mg daily , ( cautioned with administration
giving a rise in creatinine ). The patient was also maintained on
captopril , which was up titrated to 25 mg t.i.d. ( held at one
point due to the rise in the creatinine ). The patient was also
titrated up on metoprolol to 25 mg b.i.d. Rhythm: The patient
was followed by the Electrophysiology Service. In the CCU , he
was noted to have sinus arrest of 8-9 seconds in the setting of
apnea. Following transfer to the floor , he was noted to have
sinus arrest of 4 seconds , again in the setting of apnea. His
last such episode was on 8/16/05 .  In addition , the patient has
history of atrial fibrillation/flutter , status post ablation. On
4/30/05 , he underwent pacemaker placement through cephalic
veins , which he tolerated well.
2. Pulmonary: The patient , as noted above , had several episodes
of apnea , some of which were associated with sinus arrest.
Following diuresis , the patient's apnea episodes improved. He
was recommended for formal sleep study as an outpatient.
3. Renal: The patient was admitted with a creatinine roughly
around baseline ( 2 ) , which rose briskly during his
hospitalization to a peak of 3.2 on 4/30/05 .  His FENa on
admission was 6-8%; a repeat FENa in the setting of his peak
serum creatinine of 3.2 and following 10 kg of diuresis was
1.86%. His urine eosinophils were negative. His UA showed
evidence of a UTI plus triple phosphate crystals; urine culture
showed greater than 100 , 000 colonies of mixed morphology. It was
thought that the rise in the patient's creatinine was likely due
to a combination of intravascular depletion and possibly UTI.
The patient was started on antibiotics following his pacemaker
placement , which would be expected to cover GU microbial flora
and SNHU microbes.
4. Endocrine: The patient had a history of diabetes and was
maintained on a Regular Insulin sliding scale.
5. ID: The patient was expected to having an UTI as noted
above. Following his pacemaker placement , he was placed on
cefazolin while in-house , followed by Keflex. The patient should
stay on Keflex for four days.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Albuterol inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d. p.r.n. wheezing.
2. Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. daily.
3. Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Rosenburg is a 58-year-old
gentleman with significant medical history of past acute
myocardial infarction in 1994 who presented with complaints of
substernal chest pressure for 2 days on 6/19/2005 .  The patient
stated that the pain was substernal in nature with radiation to
the left side. It was 3-4/10 in intensity. The pain resolved
spontaneously. The patient after sometime has a similar brief
episode of substernal chest pressure that made him come to the
hospital where he was found to have a troponin level of 0.29 with
flat CPK and MB. He was admitted to Oncrest Hospital during
his previous heart attack where he had a PTCA done of his left
anterior descending coronary artery. He underwent cardiac
catheterization on 6/19/2005 , which revealed a left main coronary
artery with a mid 35% stenosis , left circumflex coronary artery
with a proximal 75% stenosis , first obtuse marginal with an
ostial 90% stenosis and a 45% stenosis , left anterior descending
coronary artery with a mid 95% stenosis , first diagonal coronary
artery with an ostial 85% stenosis , second diagonal coronary
artery with a proximal 95% stenosis , right dominant circulation ,
posterior descending artery 50% stenosis with a mid 90% stenosis.

ADMIT DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure , aortic valve and
mitral valve dysfunction.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is 59-year-old female who is
status post mitral valve repair , aortic valve repair , history of
endocarditis , history of rheumatic heart disease , hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus , and congestive heart failure who presents with
increasing shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal
pain. She has been under significant stress at home since last
summer and notes slowly declining health since that time. She
has had increasing shortness of breath as well as dyspnea on
exertion since September 2004 and has gotten worse in the past one
month , and even significantly worse in the past week. The
patient notes increasing lower extremity edema on the right side
greater than the left. She states that this is her baseline with
the right side being more than the left. She has no increase in
her abdominal girth , the patient has two-to three-pillow
orthopnea ( from one-pillow orthopnea , one month ago ) , she does
have some paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , she has no increased
nocturia. The patient notes that the shortness of breath is ""not
angina; I do not have that."" She does not have any
lightheadedness , diaphoresis , or radiation of pain. The patient
says that she does not check her weigh at home , but ""knows"" she
is in failure when she is short of breath. She also notes
nausea , vomiting , and some abdominal pain stating that it started
about a week and a half ago. She had gone to see the ED on the
Sunday prior to admission where the patient reportedly had a
benign exam , low-grade temperature , given recent Levaquin for an
upper respiratory tract infection , she was then started on Flagyl
for a possible C. difficile infection. The patient's diarrhea
stopped , but she had still remained some abdominal pain and
increased cough , which was nonproductive. She went to her PCP on
the day of admission for increasing shortness of breath and was
sent to the ED for diuresis. In the ED , she was given 60 mg of
IV Lasix with good output per report. She did have some decrease
in her shortness of breath shortly thereafter. She also
complained of 10/10 abdominal pain and was given some Dilaudid.
On the floor during the interview , she did have some projectile
vomiting. She was able to pass gas. She reported no fevers ,
chills , or night sweats. She reported no bright red blood per
rectum. She reported no change in her bowel , bladder , or urinary
habits.

at 65 beats per minute. She had frequent PVCs. There was a
normal access. There were some nonspecific T-wave inversions.
CHEST X-RAY: Showed mild vascular congestion. There was no
evidence of any effusion.
IMPRESSION: This is a 59-year-old female with a rheumatic heart
disease , status post St. Jude's MVR and AVR , congestive heart
failure who presents with mild volume overload and abdominal pain
with nausea and vomiting.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: When the patient was admitted , she was ruled out
for an MI. She did have a slight increase of her troponins ,
which were attributed to mild demand ischemia. In addition , she
had some slight anemia , which could also be contributed to the
demand as well in addition to the clear volume overload. She did
fine from the standpoint , had no ST changes on any of her EKGs.
The patient laid her head workup for future AVR and MVR with the
Surgical Service , with Dr. Bio . Her workup was extensive and
included a cardiac catheterization , which showed no significant
coronary artery disease. The hemodynamics were notable for the
following: RA of 12 , PA of 92/23/44 , pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 22 with V waves to 42. The mitral valve was grossly
normal with appropriate leaflet motion. The AV was also grossly.
The overall conclusion was elevated right-sided heart pressures.
She had no evidence of major atherosclerotic disease of the
coronary arteries.
b. Pump: Please see cath report as above. The patient was
admitted and diuresed with IV Lasix , so she came down to a
euvolemic state. Her diuresis was continued with 80 mg IV Lasix
on a b.i.d. basis. She was diuresed until there was a subsequent
bump in her creatinine to 1.8 , 1.9. After that point , diuresis
was slowly modified. She was then placed back on a regimen of
120 mg of p.o. Lasix q.o.d. That is the dosing of Lasix on which
she is discharged.
c. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation that has been rate controlled with a beta-blocker.
On admission , her digoxin was stopped. She was evaluated by the
EP Service. They recommended epicardial lead placement at
surgery due to her tachybrady syndrome. The patient was
discharged on diltiazem 30 mg q.i.d. She will have her
medications modified status post her valvular repair in the very
near future.
d. Presurgical workup: In addition to echo , right and left
heart cath , the patient had a TEE performed. TEE showed normal
left atrial appendage without evidence of localized thrombus.
St. Jude's valve was well seated in the aortic position. There
was no significant aortic regurg that was noted. A St. Jude's
valve was well seated in the mitral position as well. There was
trace mild regurgitation noted. There was slight asynchronous
motion of the prosthetic valve apparatus that was noted. The
tricuspid valve was normal in appearance. There was mild
regurgitation present. Visualized portion of the thoracic aorta
revealed minimal atheromatous plaque.
2. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from her pulmonary
standpoint. She continued to sat well on room air. She did not
required any nebulizers during her stay.
3. GI: The patient was initially admitted with some abdominal
pain and also nausea and vomiting. She had a KUB performed for a
question of potential bowel obstruction. A single frontal view
of the abdomen was obtained and is reported in the final
radiology report. There was gas seen within the loops of small
bowel as well as the colon. There is no bowel dilatation seen.
The overall impression was no evidence of any high-grade bowel
obstruction. It is likely that some of her pain was secondary to
hepatic congestion. The nausea and vomiting eventually resolved
and perhaps this is some type of viral illness or
gastroenteritis. She did have some episode of diarrhea prior to
admission along with some abdominal cramping. The patient was
continued on her PPI for GERD prophylaxis. At one point , she
required increasing her dosage of Nexium secondary to GERD-like
symptoms. It seemed that increasing the amount of Nexium she
received , precipitated some diarrhea. She was returned to a
normal dosing of Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. while in-house. She was
discharged on omeprazole 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , which she will
continue to take as an outpatient. In addition , she was given
prescription for Colace and also Senokot today. She should
continue using.
4. Heme: Her hematocrit remained relatively stable during her
stay with averaging of 26 to 27 as far as her hematocrit. We
were not concerned with keeping her hematocrit 30 or above at all
times given her clean coronary arteries seen from the left and
also right heart catheterization. She did have a slight dip in
her hematocrit at one point requiring two units of packed red
blood cells. Her hematocrit bumped appropriately to 30 or 31.
She required no subsequent transfusions thereafter. With regard
to anticoagulation , she was placed on the heparin drip at 950
units per hour to maintain a PTT between 60 and 80 secondary to
her mechanical valves that are in place. On discharge , the
patient was transitioned to Lovenox 60 mg b.i.d. with a renal
dosing. She will continue to take this Lovenox as an outpatient
and stop it one to two days prior to her surgery as instructed.
She has home VNA in place.
5. Renal: Her BUN and creatinine was relatively stable on
admission. It did elevate to as high as 3.3 , 3.4 on her
admission secondary to her ongoing diuresis. When diuresis was
held for several days given her markedly increased urine output
and as she became more hydrated and euvolemic , her creatinine
returned to its baseline of 1.2 , 1.3. She has no active issues
now.
6. Endocrine: We appreciated the Diabetes Service for following
her very closely while in-house. Several modifications were made
to her regimen while here to get good control of her blood
glucose. She was maintained on a stable regimen of NPH 60 units
in the morning , NPH 30 units in the evening. She also was placed
on a sliding scale. She also received NovoLog of 15 units in the
morning with breakfast and also 15 at dinner. She was not
receiving any of the NovoLog while at lunch. She will continue
to take this regimen in home. All of her prescriptions were
provided by Carl Mcclenahan , who is following with the Diabetes
Service. They will become again involved with her care as she
plans for surgery in the very near future.
7. Infectious disease: The patient was stable from an ID
standpoint during her entire admission. On September , 2005 , the
patient was noted to have an increase in her white blood cell
count upwards towards the 20 , 000. This was one day prior to a
planned surgery on April , 2005 with Dr. Villata to repair her
aortic valve and also her mitral valve. The surgery was delayed
as a result of this , so an infectious workup could ensue. She
had a urine sent that showed , the suggestion of a urinary tract
infection. Levaquin was given for treatment of her UTI.
Surveillance cultures were drawn daily. Given the fact that she
had a right groin hematoma that performed after the heart
catheterization we questioned whether or not this could be some
type of infectious source. She had the hematoma aspirated , it
was negative for any organisms. She had no other identified
places as far as source of infection. It was believed that she
could potential have endocarditis as she has had in the past.
One of her cultures actually grew out a species of Abiotrophia.
There is only one culture positive , that was taken on February .
She has had no subsequent cultures growing out at the time of
this dictation. We appreciate the Infectious Disease Team
following. Their recommendations were to hold antibiotics unless
subsequent cultures began to grow out. Their recommendations
were to continue to follow all cultures and to perform a TEE. A
repeat TEE was performed and showed no evidence of any lesions or
change in bowel function. There were clearly no vegetation seen
on either any transthoracic echos or TEEs. ID made
recommendations as far as perioperative antibiotics , which would
include two weeks of ceftriaxone 1 g IV b.i.d. under the
assumption that this would be completing a course of her therapy
after SBE. They would also recommend sending all valve tissue
for Gram stain and culture as well as pathology. If the Gram
stain and culture were positive , they would suggest extending the
course of the above-mentioned antibiotic therapy.
8. Neurologic: The patient was given Darvon and also codeine as
needed for her pain. She complained of right groin pain
secondary to the hematoma. Her pain is much improved that she is
able to ambulate easily around the Tl Brown Vo on discharge. The
hematoma is resolving and her pain is resolving as well.
9. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient is
tolerating p.o. well. Her electrolytes were repleted as needed
daily.
10. Psychologic: The patient was seen by social work. It is
clear that she has many anxieties about the surgery and also in
going home and returning to her social environment. She
necessitated volume prior to many procedures given her severe
anxiety.
11. Disposition: The patient is stable from a medical
standpoint with all cultures clear and no evidence of active
infection. Her white blood cell count is now normal. She is now
awaiting surgical repair of her valve and will have a surgery
scheduled with Dr. Berreth office in the next one to two weeks.

office to coordinate her appointment for her valve repair in the
next one to two weeks pending her surgeon's return.
2. The patient instructed to call Dr. Doug Schlanger on January ,
2005 , to discuss surgical plans and also to follow up.
3. The patient should have all her blood cultures followed up
prior to her surgery. If any of her blood cultures become
positive in the interim , we will begin a long course of
antibiotic therapy and delay surgery at the discussion of the
Cardiovascular Service.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: HYPERLIPIDEMIA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Legions is a 54 year old professor
at A No Sa , status
post coronary artery bypass graft ( 5 vessel bypass ) 8 years ago who
presents with recurrent substernal chest pain times one day. The
patient was transferred from Phlukester Hospital after developing the
acute onset of substernal chest pain while driving his automobile.
The patient was under no extraordinary circumstances ( e.g.
emotional stress , exertional stress ) at the time he developed chest
pain. Since the time of his five vessel CABG in 1987 , the patient
had experienced no intercurrent angina.
The patient's coronary risk factors include a positive family
history and a previous diagnosis of hyperlipidemia. However the
patient does not have hypertension , diabetes and he is not a
tobacco smoker.
As mentioned , the patient's chest pain was substernal and radiated
to the upper epigastrium. He experienced an element of burning
with exertion. Prior to this episode of recurrent chest pain , the
patient had had multiple exercise tolerance tests which were read
as normal. He graded the chest pain at 8/10.
The patient presented to G urgent care where his pain was not
relieved with four sublingual nitroglycerin. An EKG demonstrated
lateral ST wave depressions. The patient was transferred to
Skaggssin Hospital where IV TNG , morphine and Nifedipine were given.
The patient's pain decreased to a level of 4/10. Despite these
maneuvers , the patient's pain continued through the night and in
the morning. In the morning , he received additional morphine and
IV Heparin was begun. Subsequently the patient became pain-free.
The patient was transferred to Ck Health Of for
further management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hyperlipidemia. Bilateral anterior and
lateral thigh achiness with exertion
times six months ( workup in progress ).
MEDICATIONS: On presentation to Menjack Hospital Medical Center ,
Lovastatin 40 mg q q.m. , 20 mg q p.m. and
enteric-coated aspirin one tablet q day.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM A,XO COMMUNITY HOSPITAL IV nitroglycerin , IV heparin , Nifedipine SL , morphine as
well as aspirin and Lovastatin.
The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's father developed angina secondary
to coronary artery disease at age 54 and died
at age 75 from an MI.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives at home with
his wife. He works as a professor at
Rieglemoinesro A Shing and restores buildings in his free time.
HABITS: The patient denies tobacco use. He is an
occasional alcohol drinker.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , Mr. Latimer is
a pleasant middle-aged man , mildly
anxious but in no acute distress. Vital signs on transfer:
temperature 98.6 , heart rate 78 , blood pressure 110/78 , respiratory
rate 22 with oxygen saturation of 99% on 4 liters of oxygen.
HEENT: unremarkable. Neck: no jugular venous distention ( JVP
less than 6 cm ) , carotids were 2+ bilaterally with no bruits or
delayed upstroke. Lungs: clear with good breath sounds
bilaterally. Coronary: regular rate and rhythm with good heart
sounds and a clear Sl and S2. There were no rubs , murmurs or
gallops appreciated. There was no S3 or S4. The point of maximum
impulse was not displaced. The patient's spine was not tender and
there was no evidence of costovertebral angle tenderness. Abdomen
had good bowel sounds and was soft and nontender to palpation. No
masses were palpated. Groin demonstrated decreased femoral pulses
bilaterally with a faint left femoral bruit. Rectal: normal
rectal tone with an anodular prostate. Stool was soft , brown and
guaiac negative. Extremities demonstrated no clubbing , cyanosis or
edema. The patient's pulses at the dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibialis were 2+ bilaterally. Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
Electrolytes on presentation were within normal limits. His LFTs
were notable for a slight increase in his LDH to 252. The
patient's first CK on presentation was 2300 with a quantitative MB
of 10.2 ng/ml. Cholesterol was 79. Albumin 2.8. Protime 12.4 ,
INR 1.1. PTT 40.7 , consistent with heparin therapy. CBC was
notable for a normal white count , hematocrit and platelet count.
Urine had a specific gravity of 1.021 , pH 5 , negative dipstick
evaluation.
Chest x-ray demonstrated clear lung parenchyma and no bony
abnormalities. EKG on admission to Raldmance Mountbay
showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 73 with normal intervals
and an axis of 0. The patient had Q waves in leads 3 and F and
biphasic T waves in leads V4 through V6. There was minimal change
in these abnormalities with resolution of the patient's pain. Of
note , EKGs taken at Townileahli Medical Center during the patient's initial
admission were notable for T wave depressions in leads V4 through
V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Intensive Care Unit on IV heparin and
nitroglycerine as well as continuation of his aspirin and
Lovastatin. The patient's pain was treated with morphine sulfate.
His CKs were followed serially every 8 hours and achieved a peak CK
of 2790 on 6/16/95 at 12 a.m. with an MB fraction of 188.8 ng/ml.
Thereafter the patient's CKs rapidly declined. On 3/30/94 , the
patient's CK was 317 with an MB fraction of 3.5 ng/ml.
After 24 hours pain-free in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit , the
patient was transferred to the Cardiac Step-Down floor. His IV
nitroglycerin and IV heparin were discontinued and the patient
remained pain-free. Echocardiogram performed on 6/16/95
demonstrated inferior and posterior hypokinesis with an ejection
fraction of approximately 46%.
On 3/9/95 , the patient underwent exercise tolerance testing with a
submax modified Bruce protocol. The patient exercised 9 minutes
and was able to complete the study without dyspnea on exertion or
chest pain. He achieved a maximum heart rate of 108 and a
maximum blood pressure of 160/80. EKG was notable for unifocal
PVCs and up to 2 mm ST depression in leads V2 through V4 which
persisted up to 15 minutes into recovery. The patient was given
one sublingual nitroglycerin and these EKG changes resolved.
The exercise tolerance test was interpreted as strongly positive
for ischemic coronary artery disease.
On 1/9/95 , the patient underwent a submax MIBI to assess coronary
perfusion of the heart. Similarly , the exercise component of this
examination demonstrated EKG changes consistent with ischemic
coronary flow. Nuclear imaging demonstrated a fixed apical lateral
defect in the patient's heart consistent with a healed or healing
transmural infarct. There was no evidence of ischemic reperfusion
defects.
The results of these tests were discussed with the patient and his
wife in conjunction with the treating medical team of Dr. Settecase .
The patient was offered the opportunity for coronary
catheterization to evaluate his anatomy , but he declined at the
present time. It was decided that the patient would be maximally
medically managed and discharged to home with close followup under
Dr. Cockburn and Dr. Stenkamp . The patient's cardiac medications were
appropriately adjusted while an inpatient to achieve maximum
cardiac benefit.
On presentation , the patient also complained of progressive
anterior and lateral thigh pain. This pain was brought on by
exertion and had increasingly limited his ability to walk over the
last six months whereas he had been able to walk four to five miles
a day in recent months. He had been able to walk only
approximately one-quarter mile before developing pain in his
anterior thighs as well whereas he had been able to climb several
flights of stairs a few months ago. He now was able to walk only
half a flight to a flight of stairs at a time before having to
rest. Six months ago , the patient had achieved a 25 pound weight
loss but , by his report , because of his inability to exercise
effectively , he had regained 15 pounds. The patient did not
experience this same anterior thigh pain while riding a bicycle or
swimming. As an inpatient , Mr. Woollen underwent a non-invasive
vascular study of the femoral and popliteal arteries. These
demonstrated no significant arterial occlusions as assessed by
pressure manometry. The possibility of myositis or neuromuscular
compromise was entertained and these are to be followed up as an
outpatient.
The patient also complained of symptoms consistent with an upper
respiratory viral infection which he had been experiencing over the
past two weeks. While an inpatient , he had a number of febrile
episodes , achieving a maximum temperature of 101.4. The patient
was treated symptomatically with Tylenol and started on Biaxin 500
mg po bid. He received a five day course of oral Biaxin with
resolution of his fever and decrease in his symptomatology.
The patient never complained of shortness of breath , palpitations ,
diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting or recurrent chest pain as an
inpatient. However physical examination demonstrated rales 4 to 5
cm above the bases bilaterally. The extremities remained free of
edema and the patient's jugular venous pressure never exceeded 6
cm. A chest x-ray on 5/7/95 demonstrated evidence of early
congestive heart failure. The patient was treated with daily doses
of IV Lasix with resolution of his rales. By the time of
discharge , there was no evidence of continued heart failure and the
patient's Lasix was discontinued.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg po q day
2. Cholestyramine one packet po q hs
3. Lovastatin 20 mg po q hs
4. Lopressor 50 mg po tid
5. Sublingual nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets to be taken prn
with chest pain
DISPOSITION: The patient is being discharged to home with
followup in MERH under Drs. Dwayne Ariel Bremme .
The patient was instructed to call CMH Urgent Care if his chest
pain recurs and does not resolve with sublingual nitroglycerin.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a 64-year-old with known CAD , atherosclerotic peripheral
vascular disease , and type 2 diabetes presented with back pain. She
describes a sudden onset of 8/10 stabbing back pain 4 days ago without
a clear precipitant. The pain was non raditating and partially releived
with analgesics.She denied any bowel or bladder incontinence or saddle
anesthes ia. She denied any fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , or
diarrhea. She does however complain of some urinary frequency ( on
lasix ) in the last few days with out any dysuria or urgency. Of note
over the past month she has had increasing had shortness of breath
however she denies any orthopnea or PND. The patient has long standing
pedal edema and has increasing abdominal distension over the last month
but has not noticed any change in her weight. The patient has CAD and
her angina equivalent is jaw pain.However in the last 6 months she has
had intermittent left sided chest pain that radiates to her left arm.
In the ED the patient was ruled out for an aortic dissection , MI and
had a negative D-Dimer. However lipase levels have been elevated with
norm al LFTs. She was admitted with a diagnosis of pancreatitis.
Hospital course:
1.GI- S/P cholecystectomy. Her lipase was mildly elevated on
admission to 200 , fell to 60 with NPO and IVF. However , MRA read with
radiology 4/4 shows diffuse atherosclerotic disease including
stenosis of celiac artery , vascular surgery was consulted for concer
about mesenteric ischemia. They do not think she is having symptoms of
ischemia , would like abdominal MRA to further assess abdominal
vasculature. Triglycerides very high , could be cause of her
pancreatitis , starting gemfibrozil. LDL was 151.
2.Cardivascular- Ischemia-On a beta blocker , statin , ARB , ruled out
for an MI , but has 6 month history of chest pain. Adenosine MIBI
negative. Started gemfibrozil. Pump-We changed atenolol to toprol XL
and amlodipine.
3.Endocrine- Has had poor glucose control. HbA1c 13. We continued
NPH qhs and started AM NPH as well.
4.Renal-Chronic renal insufficiency , Cr stable.
5. ID - Patient c/o urinary frequency. U/A negative.
6.Psych-On amitryptilline and fluoxetine.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take all medications as described. You will need to follow a
low fat and low carbohydrate diet to control your cholesterol and
diabetes. Please take insulin in the morning as well as the night ,
check your fingersticks twice a day and record them. Please see
Dr. Colleen on 5/14 and ask him to help with your insulin regimen.
Please go to your MRI appointment 8/21 and see Dr. Cicerchia 6/23 .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Ms Galabeas is a 71F with DM , CAD , s/p 3vCABG , s/p RCA stent in 10/22 ,
CHF( EF=45% in 10/22 ) , h/o bradycardia now with AICD/Pacer , s/p R-CEA ,
s/p ? TIA , who presents with dizziness , ataxia x 24H.
Pt denies CP , SOB , palpitations. Pt denies melana; BRBPR. NO new meds ,
no N/V/F/C. This is unlike anything she has had in the past.
In the ED , labs were all within normal limits. While on a monitor she
had an episode of bradycardia to the 40s. Dr. Hilmer of
the EP service interogated the device and indicated that it was
working properly with no arrhythmias. Telemetry in the ED also did
not record the bradycardic episode , suggesting that perhaps it was an
artifact. Pt's toxicology screen was negative. Her vitals in the ED w
ere 98.0 , 55 , 176/60 , 18 , 98%RA. No dysmetria; no dysdiadocokinesia;
negativ e Romberg's sign.
Hospital Course:
1. CV: pt ruled out for MI; 24H telemetry showed no arrhythmias.
Pt's BB was held while in house because of worry about
bradyarrhythmia , hypotension. Continued antihypertensive and CAD
treatment with with Cozaar , Lasix , Norvasc , Isosorbide , Digoxin ,
Amiodarone. Pt is also on Coumadin , Plavix , and ASA , which was
continued in house. Pt was discussed w/ pt's cardiologist , Dr.
Kallio who indicated this was not a new complaint in the patient and
also that she has been non-compliant in the past. PT was on Coreg but
this was held prior to admit for low BP's. Pt was hypertensive w/ SB
P 150's while inpt but we will d/c pt off Coreg and defer to Dr.
Doniel for reinstitution of beta blockade
2. NEURO: pt's neuro exam was normal with no focal signs , and no signs
of cerebellar dysfunction. Nevertheless given her significant vascular
risk factors there was concern for vertebral-basilar insufficiency.
MRI/MRA was not possible given pt's AICD/pacer. Upon discussion w/
team CT/CTA were deferred given pt's renal insufficiency and risk of
contrast nephropathy coupled with our feeling that any findings would
not change pt management. This will be discussed with pt's PCP , Dr.
Benedict Wichern .
3. ENDO: pt was continued on home insulin regimen with coverage with
insulin sliding scale. Pt was found have a TSH of 158 FT4 1.8 , FT3 56.
Upon discussion w/ pt , she revealed that she had previously been
diagnosed and begun on replacement but did not know what it was for and
subsequently stopped it on her own. Pt started on synthroid to be f/u
w/endocrine. This may be the etiology of her symptoms.
4. Prophylaxis: Nexium; pt was already anticoagulated with ASA , plavix
and Coumadin.
5. Disp: Pt to follow-up w/ Dr. Kishaba for managment of CHF/BP , and
with Dr. Blagg for f/u of potential neurovascular etiology of symptoms.
Pt to f/u with endocrinology for managment of hypothyroidism.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. continue levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. f/u endo for management
2. f/u w/ Dr. Schryer for possible reinstitution of beta blockade and
CHF/BP management
3. f/u Dr. Hackborn for w/u potential vertebral-basilar insufficieny with
recognition of risk of iv contrast nephropathy vs utility of

SERVICE: ONCOLOGY INPATIENT Louis Stockwood His
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: APLASTIC ANEMIA , HERE FOR HICKMAN PLACEMENT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Norsingle history dates back to
1976 , when she was diagnosed with
aplastic anemia. She did not have a bone marrow donor match at
that time and was thus treated with steroids without significant
effect. She has been transfusion dependent since 1986 and has
required q.2 weekly packed red blood cell transfusions and p.r.n.
platelet transfusions for epistaxis. She has had multiple
complications of her aplastic anemia , including hemochromatosis ,
bronzed diabetes , history of hepatitis B and hepatitis C positivity
secondary to transfusions , avascular necrosis of both hips , status
post bilateral total hip replacements , chronic shoulder bony damage
( both orthopedic prostheses secondary to chronic steroid use ) ,
history of perirectal abscess with Klebsiella while neutropenic ,
history of multiple Port-A-Cath infections. Her past history is
also significant for status post total abdominal hysterectomy for
high grade SIL in 1997.
Today Ms. Marsek presents for placement of a Hickman catheter
which had fallen out at the beginning of April of this year.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for fever , chills , nausea , vomiting ,
abdominal pain , upper respiratory infection
symptoms , urinary tract infection symptoms , shortness of breath ,
chest pain , palpitations.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Desferal was last given two months
prior to admission; Methadone 10 mg
t.i.d.; oxycodone 5 mg 3-4 times a day; Percocet 2-3 tabs q.4h. p.r.n.
pain ( Ms. Borchert was counseled to intake no more than two
Percocets q.8h. ); Reglan 10 mg p.o. q.i.d. p.r.n. with meals for
nausea; insulin 50 units NPH in the morning , 10 units regular in
the morning , 10 units NPH at 5:00 p.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: VITAL SIGNS: 99.3 , heart rate
75 , blood pressure 120/74 ,
respiratory rate 18 , satting 100% on room air. HEENT: Pupils
equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular
movements intact. Oropharynx is without erythema. Mucous
membranes were moist. NECK: Supple with 2+ carotids bilaterally.
LUNGS: Clear bilaterally. HEART: Regular rate with normal S1 and
S2 , no murmurs. ABDOMEN: Soft with normoactive bowel sounds; no
hepatosplenomegaly. She had no palpable liver nodules. She has
slight nonpitting edema bilaterally in her ankles which was
baseline. NEUROLOGIC: She was alert and oriented x3. Cranial
nerves II-XII were intact.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She has a distant history of alcohol use. She is
a single mother with three children , ages 13 , 9 ,
and 9.
FAMILY HISTORY: Remarkable for diabetes in multiple family
members.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Pettit is a 35-year-old woman with a long
history of transfusion dependent aplastic anemia
with multiple complications secondary to hemochromatosis and
chronic steroid use. She was admitted for replacement of a Hickman
catheter which had fallen out in April of this year. Prior to the
procedure she was transfused with two bags of platelets. She had
one bag of platelets on call to the Interventional Radiology Suite ,
but did not require these platelets. She was also transfused two
units of packed red cells for a hematocrit of 23. On July ,
1999 , she had a right internal jugular venous Hickman catheter
placed without difficulty. There were no complications from the
procedure. There is no pneumothorax by fluoroscopy. The tip was
in the proximal right atrium , okay to use. Both lumens aspirated
freely and were flushed with heparin prior to being sent back up on
the floor. On the evening of July , 1999 , Ms. Deboer began an
infusion of Desferal while in house , watching carefully for signs
of anaphylaxis , as she has not received an infusion in over two
months. After she completes her Desferal infusion , she will be
sent home with visiting nurse for Hickman catheter care and
followup with Dr. Keith Hermans in clinic.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good.
DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with home services for Hickman
catheter care and monitoring of CBC.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: L4-L5 , L5-S1 HERNIATED NUCLEUS PULPOSUS.
PROCEDURE: Revision decompression at S1 with iliac crest graft
fusion. Instrument fusion with a later iliac bone
graft.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68-year-old male with
a history of lumbar spinal stenosis ,
status post L3-L4 , L4-L5 foraminotomy , left-sided L5-S1 foraminal
decompression , and L4-L5 laminectomy with new L4-L5 , L5-S1
herniated nucleus pulposus , and lower back pain with radicular
symptoms. He described his back pain as 80% of his complaint , and
20% is his radicular symptoms. The pain is greater on the right
than on the left. He has had conservative management. He
complains of bowel and bladder changes with decreased rectal tone ,
and control with urine and feces. He denies any lower extremity
weakness or numbness throughout his perineum. He was recently seen
in the I Ieldwall Health Care Emergency Room on 1/11/02 , for low back
pain and sciatica; however , he left AMA. He presents for elective
decompression and instrument infusion of his lumbar spine.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Obesity , hypertension , diabetes mellitus ,
coronary artery disease , GI bleed. A
history of seizure disorder and peripheral neuropathy.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Bilaterally total knee arthroplasty;
shoulder surgery; aortic valve replacement ,
times two; cardiac catheterization; hydrocele repair.

unable to achieve therapeutic INR.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a reformed smoker and drinker. He is a
retired salesman.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pertinent neurologic findings. Bilateral
lower extremity edema. Light touch is
intact throughout with slight decrease in bilateral feet consistent
with neuropathy , left greater than right. Decreased sensation.

foraminal narrowing.
The EKG shows no ST elevation or depression; however , there is no
prior study for comparison.
Laboratory values: Potassium 4.7. Hematocrit 38.5. INR 1.0.
Urinalysis negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent lumbar spine decompression
with L4-S1 instrument infusion with augmentation
of the iliac crest bone graft. Postoperative course was
uneventful. The patient remained afebrile , hemodynamically stable.
Autologous blood was necessary. He was required to maintain a
hematocrit above 30. He remained afebrile. Normal perioperative
antibiotics were given , however. His p.o. intake was delayed
secondary to delay in return of GI function. He did have an
episode of dark emesis early in his postoperative course on
postoperative day #1/2. He was slow to mobilize with physical
therapy. This was in part secondary to his pain level and also
intermittent confusion , for which a medicine consult was obtained.
Kayexalate was given for elevation of his potassium; otherwise , his
confusion resolved with decrease of his narcotic medications.
Physical therapy was able to resume. He was able to advance
appropriately. Hospitalization was prolonged secondary to waiting
for a rehab placement. At the time of discharge , his incision was
clear , dry and intact.
He was discharged to the _____ rehab with the following
instructions. Discharge medications: OxyContin , Percocet , and
Colace , in addition to preoperative medications. Activity:

1 ) Lightheadedness: unclear etiology but most likely 2/2 elevated BP
>200s as sxs resolved with BP lowering. She was not orthostatic , hct at
baseline , cardiac enzymes negative , and prior MRI/MRA in 2004 without
acute process. Her BP remained well controlled back on her home regimen
( ? compliance but she states she was taking her meds ). Will have outpt
MRI/MRA done , though low suspicion for disease and unclear if would
intervene if disease present. Given HTN spells , concern for a cause of
secondary hypertension. Labs sent for plasma catecholamines , aldoseterone
and plasma rening ( pending as of discharge )
2 )DM: -Aspart SS while in house but continued her home DM meds on day of
discharge.
3 )Disp: d/c to home and she will f/u with Dr Laychock in clinic.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please be sure to take all of your blood pressure medications every day
as prescribed. We think your symptoms were caused by very high blood
pressures.
Please be sure to follow up with Dr Carlos .
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Please follow up with plasma catecholamines , plasma renin and
aldosterone ( taken when patient supine , in am ).

ATTENDING: LORENSON , REED MD
SERVICE:
RBMC .
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Rule out MI.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Angina , tachycardia , and hypertension.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
Hypertension , chest pain , GERD , coronary artery disease ,
osteoarthritis , anxiety , diverticulosis , hypercholesterolemia ,
and chronic dizziness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with history of coronary
artery disease and difficult to control hypertension who
presented with chest pain in the setting of the elevated blood
pressure and tachycardia. Two days prior to admission , the
patient had developed the abrupt onset of palpitation , chest
pain , diaphoresis , anxiety , and shortness of breath. She took
her blood pressure and this was found to be greater than 200 with
the rapid pulse. She called her PCP and was instructed to call
911. She was taken to the Ha Hstibrook Medical Center ED. Of
note , she had not taken her Toprol-XL for the prior three days.
In the emergency department , the systolic blood pressure was in
the 180s. This was controlled with her home medications and IV
Lopressor. The patient was ruled out for an MI in ED/OBS. She
went for a MIBI on the morning of admission , but this was
canceled because the patient was dizzy. Of note , the patient has
had an identical admission several months earlier for a labile
blood pressure. During that admission , the patient's hydralazine
and beta-blocker was titrated up with improved blood pressure
control. She was ruled out for pheochromocytoma and renal
artery stenosis. She did have elevated plasma metanephrines
during that admission. She was discharged at that point on an
improved antihypertensive regimen as described above. She also
reports having had a similar episode two weeks ago.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Hypertension , angina , osteoarthritis , GERD , diverticulosis ,
hyperlipidemia , coronary artery disease status post CABG x4 and
multiple stents , chronic dizziness , stable cath 8/4 .

ALLERGIES:
ACE inhibitor , amlodipine , and niacin.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
No smoking , no ethanol. She lives in West O Uxkan by herself , has a
helper ( visiting aid ). No family nearby. Her family lives in
Pit Forda Sta
FAMILY HISTORY:
Her brother died at 61 years old of CVA. Her mother died at 75
years old with CVA. Her sister had an MI at age 80.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Vital signs: Heart rate 98 , blood pressure 172/70 with a range
of 103-172/40-70. O2 saturation was 97% on room air. Her exam
was significant for tachycardia with a regular rate , normal S1
and S2 , and soft systolic ejection murmur at the right upper
sternal border. The remainder of the exam was unremarkable.
LABS ON ADMISSION:
CBC was within normal limits. Chem-7 was significant for BUN of
22 and creatinine of 103. Calcium was 10.5 , phosphorus was 2.5 ,
and albumin was 4.3. LFTs were normal. Her D-dimer was 1305.
She had two sets of negative cardiac enzymes. Coags were normal.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at the rate of 75 beats per minute ,
left axis deviation , LVH , left atrial enlargement. T-wave
flatting in lead III only.
STUDIES:
1. Chest x-ray ( 9/29/05 ): No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. PE CT ( 11/9/05 ): No PE.
3. Head CT ( 11/9/05 ): Left-sided meningiomas , unchanged from
2004.
4. MIBI ( 10/27/05 ): Area of reversible ischemia , unchanged from
2002.
CONSULTS:
Cardiology ( FMCO ): Luke Ollie Buckley .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Paroxysmal hypertension/tachycardia: This was in the setting
of not taking her Toprol. She does have a history of labile
blood pressure and difficult to control hypertension. This
symptom was thought to look very much like pheochromocytoma , but
this was ruled out last admission. Renal artery stenosis was
also ruled out last admission. Given the description and the
fact that she had elevated plasma metanephrines on the previous
admission , one possible diagnosis that was considered with pseudo
pheochromocytoma. Studies for pheochromocytoma , pseudo
pheochromocytoma , carcinoid , and hypothyroidism ( including
24-hour urine metanephrines were sent ) these all returned as
negative. Her TSH was normal. She was initially put on q.i.d.
Lopressor and hydralazine. The hydralazine was then discontinued
due to hypotension. Her Lopressor was changed to Toprol-XL , this
was also discontinued for hypotension. Her ultimate regimen was
titrated based on her blood pressures and eventually she was put
on Avapro 75 mg daily , atenolol 25 mg daily , and her home dose of
Imdur 120 mg daily. Her target blood pressures were 140s to 150s
and with this regimen , she was well controlled and asymptomatic
upon discharge.
2. Ischemia: She was initially ruled out for MI. Her MIBI
showed reversible ischemia unchanged from 2002 despite two
catheterizations in intervening time. She was seen by LMH
Cardiology , and this defect was felt to be nonintervenable. She
was discharged home in stable condition and chest pain free.
3. Dizziness/nausea: She had episodes of this during her
hospitalization. It was of unclear etiology and she has had a
previous significant prior workup ( see previous discharge
summary ). She received p.r.n. meclizine and Compazine and was
discharged home without any dizziness or nausea.
4. Calcium: She had borderline high calcium and a PTH was sent
and returned mildly elevated. This will need to be followed up
as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:
Stable.
TO DO PLAN:
Further workup for question of elevated PTH in the setting of
high calcium suggestive of hyperparathyroidism.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.
2. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. daily.
3. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Lasix 40 mg daily.
5. Ibuprofen 400 mg q.8h. p.r.n. pain.
6. Lactulose 30 mL p.o. q.i.d. p.r.n. constipation.
7. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. daily p.r.n. anxiety.
8. Meclizine 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. dizziness.
9. Nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingual every five minutes
x3 doses p.r.n. chest pain.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
88 year old man who comes in from rehab with ?hypothermia and rigors. 6
weeks ago the patient was diagnosed with osteomyelitis of the finger. He
had a PICC line placed and was discharged with IV abx. At the tail end of
his antibiotic regimen he spiked a fever and was admitted to VOWH .  His
course of antibiotics was extended and he was discharged to rehab on
ceftriaxone and vanc. Today at the nursing home he was observed to be
""shaking"" and the staff was concerned for rigors. However , the patient
says his hands were just quivering. At the time , his temp at rehab was 92
degrees. He was sent to the ED for evaluation.
In the ED , his temperature was normal. He was not complaining of further
chills or rigors. However , his EKG demonstrated new ST depressions in
V3-V5. The patient denied any CP/N/SOB/diaphoresis. His first set of
enzymes were negative. He was given aspirin.

ventilator dependent , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis as
a complication likely of gentamicin in July 2006 , history of
peripheral arterial disease with multiple toe amputations and
atrial fibrillation who was recently admitted at Ahooldi Health for an increasing BUN and creatinine ,
who was transferred from Ark Hospital Medical Center after she
developed an ulcer on her right lower extremity. At baseline ,
the patient is bed bound , but is alert , able to smile and
communicates by mouthing words occasionally. She developed a
right calf hematoma several weeks prior to this admission that

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
GI: The patient was admitted to the hospital for likely UGI bleed given
significant anemia , guaic positive maroon stools and elevated BUN. She
was transfused with 2 U PRBC initially , placed NPO , IVF and GI consult
was obtained. GI took her to endoscopy and did upper endoscopy on
morning of November .  They found a friable ulcer located at an anastomosis
site from her previous bypass surgery. No active bleeding and blood
vessels were identified at the area. This represents the likely source
of her bleed. 2 more units of blood were ordered to keep goal over 30
but she only bumped to 26.6 from 20 after total of four units initially.
It is possible the blood was drawn distal to where IVF was adminitered
and there could have a been a dilutional effect. One more unit was given
for a total of five which put her over 30. Her HCT was monitored and
stayed stable at 30 after that for the remainder of her hospitalization.
She was placed on BID PPI. Her asprin and plavix were held on admission
as well as her BP meds.
---
CV: She does have a history of CAD s/p MI and coronary stents. She
had a negative MiBi a month prior to admission. A set of enzymes upon
admission were negative , another troponin was negative on the
13 of June .  Her HTN meds were held upon admission. Her goal HCT is >30
given CAD. She is on digoxin for question of afib which was on
hold during admission. Cardiac telemetry revealed no events. She had one
episode of ""chest pain"" on the night of the 13 of June which was actually
located in the epigastric region. An EKG was performed at that time
which was unchanged from the admission EKG. She was HD stable without
event on telemetry. She received NTG tabs X3 without any relief and a
follow up troponin was negative for the third time.
---
PAIN: She was continued on current pain regimen.
---
PPX: Teds , Pneumoboots
---
ENDO: She was continued home Levothyroxine
---
GI: She was constipated during admission and had not had a bowel
movement despite very aggressive regimen. Her abd became slightly
distended. The patient then started to refuse bowel meds as she was
getting prepared for discharge and was afraid to have movement on ride
home. She agreed to maintain agressive regimen at home and was instructed
to follow up with PCP or ER if she can not produce results within a day.
---
She was stable for discharge on January and discharged with instructions
to follow up with PCP within two weeks or sooner if lightheadedness ,
bloody or black stools , vomiting , chest pain or other concerns.

----------------------------------
hospital course: 60F with htn , afib presents with acute onset L sided
chest/back/shoulder pain , atypical for cardiac cp.
1. ischemia: It was felt that patient's chest pain was likely
musculoskeletal. It was worse with movement of her arms and chest and ws
reproducible with palapation. She was ruled out for MI with serial
enzymes and ekgs. We continued her asa , lowered her dose of bblocker
given bradycardia , and started the patient on an ace inhibitor. She
underwent ETT and went into rate related L bundle branch block. Full
report as follows: 1. Peak METS = 5.7 2. Duke Treadmill Score = +4
( Moderate risk: -10 to +4 ) 3. HR Recovery = 29
ASSESSMENT:1. Diagnosis: No evidence for ischemia at HR achieved.
Reduced sensitivity because ECG uninterpretable due to rate related LBBB.
2. Prognosis: Elevated prognostic risk based on low functional capacity
and a low Duke score of +4 ( Moderate risk: -10 to +4 ). 3.Arrhythmia:
Probable rate related LBBB at peak. 4. Hemodynamics: Normal exercise
hemodynamics.
Cardiology was consulted and they recommended a MIBI and echo to
better evaluate her cardiac function. She then underwent a MIBI which
showed a small inferior septaldefect , which was thought to likely be
artifact. Given the small area , it was felt medical management would be
the best approach. She was discharged on small dose of bblocker , ace
inhibitor asa and statin.
Pump: The patient's lasix had recently been increased to 60 mg bid. She
was not felt to be volume overloaded and was continued on this dose in
house. Her echo was done on the day of discharge and can be followed up
as an outpatient. Her blood pressures ran on the low side so she will
be discharged on a lower dose of her bblocker.
rhythm: Patient has underlying conduction system disease
with 1 degree av block and developed a left bundle branch block at a HR
of 150 during her ETT. She was continued on coumadin for h/o
afib
musculoskeletal pain: pain improved with standing tylenol and motrin
standing , with oxycodone for breakthrough
endocrine: Her fasting glucoses showed borderline glucose intolerance
with values around 110. These should be followed as an outpatient.
fen: low fat , low salt diet
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please follow up with you primary care provider. You did not have any
signs of significant heart disease. Please call your doctor if your
shortness of breath worsens , you develop new chest pressure , or you feel
lightheaded.
We have started a new medicine for your blood pressure and have lowered
the dose of your other blood pressure medicine.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
f/u final MIBI results

Discharge Date: 11/10/1991
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS IN THE DISTAL
RIGHT POPLITEAL VEIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 49-year-old former
triage nurse who has suffered from
degenerative joint disease since 1977 when she was hit by a Amasa Di Cison
bus. She was hospitalized at that time and had a left calf deep
venous thrombosis secondary to extended bedrest. Her joint disease
involved primarily the L4 to S1 vertebra ( comprising two joint
spaces , and she reported this to have been exacerbated by an
attempted rape in 1980. At present , the patient suffers
considerable daily pain inhibiting her ability to work. The
patient recently received a facet block in October of 1991 at the
Dukey Darnha Hospital by the Pain Service which only seemed
to increase her pain. She described steadily worsening pain in
recent months and an increased portion of her time is therefore now
spent at bedrest due to her decreased mobility. The patient
described first experiencing left calf pain one and a half weeks
prior to this admission which manifested itself as a crampy pain of
short duration. She apparently saw her private medical doctor at
this time , Dr. Denver Lehnen , who sent her out on nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs. On 4/12 , five days prior to admission ,
the patient awoke at night with severe right leg cramping. She , at
that time , went to the Mutes Hospital Emergency
Room where a noninvasive vascular study was positive for non
obstructive peroneal vein thrombosis. She was discharged on
Anaprox. On 4/29 , the patient returned to the DMC Emergency Room
complaining of increased pain and with great anxiety due to her
perceived risk of pulmonary embolus. The patient has had this
condition in the past and was quite concerned about it. Noninvasive
vascular studies at that time showed the lesion to be obstrutive in
the peroneal vein. However , there was no evidence of deep venous
thrombosis at that time. She was discharged on Coumadin , 5 mg q
day. On 8/18 , the patient experienced further worsening pain and
came to the Versteo University Medical Center for a second opinion. She
was heparinized in the Emergency Room and admitted to the Medical
Service. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denied chest pain ,
shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion , abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting , diarrhea or constipation , any recent weight loss or any
additional constitution of symptoms. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Occasional migraine headaches. L4-5 ruptured disc status post bus
accident in 1977. As stated above , she had a left lower extremity
deep venous thrombosis following that hospitalization. Previous
positive PPD , she had one year of treatment. Mugging in 1980 with
exacerbation of her joint disease. Emergency Room admission in 1988
for questionable cholecystitis. Facet block times two in 1986 and
1991. Periods of incremental menorrhagia. She is followed by Dr.
Ceo at the Warestar Medical Center .  Endometrial biopsy
recently performed was negative. Asthma. Gastritis. Appendectomy.
ALLERGIES: FISH. ERYTHROMYCIN. LACTOSE INTOLERANCE. FAMILY
HISTORY: The patient was raised by foster parents. She has some
knowledge of her natural parents. Her mother was retarded and died
of a pulmonary embolism. Her maternal grandmother had an
endochondroma. First cousin with pancreatic cancer. Maternal
grandmother had cancer of the cervix. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is
divorced times 11 years. She lives with her 16-year-old daughter.
She has a positive smoking history. She denied drinking. She
denied intravenous drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed a well developed ,
well nourished white woman in no acute
distress. The patient is mildly agitated and overly circumstantial
in her dialogue. Blood pressure 112/78. Pulse 100. Respiratory
rate is 24. Temperature 99.3. Skin was without lesions. HEENT
exam was within normal limits. Neck was supple without adenopathy.
She has a positive right anterior cervical mobile mass which
appeared to be a lipoma. She was without any jugular venous
distention. Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion. Breast
exam was refused. Cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm
with normal S1 and S2 without S3 , S4 or any rubs , murmur or gallop.
Abdomen revealed positive bowel sounds. Abdomen was soft ,
nondistended without any hepatosplenomegaly. The patient had
normal sphincter tone , no masses , guaiac negative. Extremities
revealed right calf tenderness to palpation , slightly swollen , no
warmth , positive Homan's sign. No cords were felt. The left calf
was unremarkable with some point tenderness and right inner thigh ,
again no cords felt. There was no CVA tenderness. There was
positive point tenderness in the region of L4-5 , L5-S1.
Neurological exam revealed the patient to be alert and oriented
times three. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact. No deficit of
sensory proprioception or position sense.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a sodium of 140. Potassium
of 4.3. Chloride 105. Bicarb of 30. BUN 25.
Creatinine 1.2. Glucose 89. CBC was notable for a white blood
cell count of 11.9 with 22 lymphocytes , 7 monocytes , 67
neutrophils , 2 eosinophils. Hematocrit was 41.4. Platelet count
150 , 000. PT was 16.6. PTT 29.8. All other values were within
normal limits. Urinalysis was significant for a pH of 8.0 , 1-3
white cells , 0-2 red cells , 1+ bacteria. Chest x-ray was
remarkable for no infiltrates or effusions , positive hiatal hernia.
EKG revealed sinus rhythm at 90 with intervals of 0.18/0.08/0.36 ,
no ST changes , no change since 11/23 .
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 49-year-old female with a
history of prior deep venous thrombosis with
recent decreased mobility who presented with a painful right calf
with a documented right peroneal vein obstruction. Although the
clot is only documented to be below the knee , the question of
progression must be addressed. Initially , in light of strong data
supporting these events , anti-coagulation to prevent progression of
these clots , the decision was made to further anti-coagulate the
patient as she had minimal risks for this procedure. On admission ,
there was no evidence of pulmonary embolus by history of physical.
Right calf pain/deep venous thrombosis: On the second hospital
day , the patient had noninvasive Doppler studies of her lower
extremity which were significant for deep venous thrombosis in the
distal right popliteal vein. There were no other abnormalities
seen in either lower extremity. The patient was initially treated
with heparin since her PT was subtherapeutic on admission and
continued on Coumadin. By the second hospital day , the patient was
therapeutically Coumadinized and the dose was adjusted accordingly
with the goal of 17 to 19. As far as her leg pain was concerned ,
the patient was treated with Percocet for this problem. Physical
therapy came and evaluated the patient and helped her with
regaining her mobility. She was fitted with compression stockings.
Arrangements were made for VNA for the patient upon discharge.
2 ) Back pain - This is a longstanding problem for which this
patient has been treated for for many years. She refused any
consultation at this time by the Carmau Comgarf Hospital Pain Service. Instead , we
treated her with Percocet for these symptoms. 3 ) Agitation -
Patient is extremely agitated demonstrating almost hypomanic state
with pressured speech and Flight of ideas. She was initially on
Clonipin on admission on which she was maintained. In addition ,
she was given additional benzodiazepines to help with sleep.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. Patient was
therapeutically anti-coagulated and she was given a
regimen of Coumadin to take to be followed by Dr. Garth Schoenborn .
Disposition is to home with visiting nurse service. DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 2.5 alternating with 5 mg q.d. , Clonazepam
0.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Percocet one tablet p.o. q.4-6h. , Darvocet l00

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 69 year old man without
prior cardiac history. He had cardiac
risk factors including possible hypertension and possible history
of hypercholesterolemia. The patient had had a history of atypical
chest pain including cardiac work-up in the past with an echo in
1995 showing concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with
asymmetric septal hypertrophy. He had a normal ejection fraction
at this time. In 8/7 , he had an exercise tolerance test at which
time he went eight minutes with a maximal heart rate of 151 ,
maximum blood pressure of 226/90 , and no EKG changes. At 2 p.m. on
the day of admission , he developed substernal chest pain with
crushing tightness radiating to both shoulders and his jaw. He was
not short of breath. He experienced this pain on and off through
the afternoon although the pain was never completely gone. At 6
p.m. , he became acutely worse and at that time , called the EMT and
was brought to the Agund Hospital Emergency
Department. Within the Emergency Department , the patient was noted
to have ST elevations in the inferior leads. He was enrolled in
the TONSCHAPTECH MEDICAL CENTER trial. Infusion was begun at 8:15. The patient was
given Lopressor , oxygen , morphine , aspirin , and Heparin. He did
not drop his pressure with the sublingual nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Included prostate cancer in 8/21 status
post x-ray therapy as well as a possible
transient ischemic attack in 1990.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Zantac p.r.n.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was married with three children and he
denied any tobacco or alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission demonstrated a well appearing
black male in no acute distress. His vital
signs were a heart rate of 48 , blood pressure 83/30 in the
Emergency Department , and he was afebrile with oxygen saturation of
99% on two liters. HEENT: Examination showed oropharynx benign
and he had a left facial droop. NECK: Supple , 2+ carotids without
bruit , and jugular venous pressure was normal. CHEST: Clear to
auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Had a regular bradycardic rhythm
with a II/VI systolic ejection murmur. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender ,
and nondistended with positive normal bowel sounds and no
organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: Warm , well perfused , and no clubbing ,
cyanosis , or edema with trace distal pulses. NEUROLOGICAL: He was
alert and oriented times three , cranial nerves II-XII were grossly
intact except for a left facial droop , and motor and sensory were
grossly intact.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission showed a sodium of 144 ,
potassium 4.2 , chloride 108 , bicarbonate
22 , BUN 16 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 136 , white count was 8 with a
hematocrit of 35 , platelets were 239 , CK was 276 with an MB of 0.8 ,
troponin on admission was 0.0 , INR was 1.0 , and PTT was 22.6.
Patient's first EKG in the Emergency Department showed normal sinus
rhythm at 70 with first degree AV block , axis of 56 degrees , he had
ST elevations of 4 mm in leads III and aVF and 3 mm in II , and ST
depression of 0.5 to 3 mm in V2 through V5 , I , and aVL. Chest
x-ray did not show acute disease in the Emergency Department.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Within the Emergency Department , the patient
initially had resolution of his EKG changes but
had persistent jaw pain remaining at 10/25 .  He was taken to
catheterization which demonstrated a mid right coronary artery
lesion of approximately 95% with a clot but with TIMI 3 flow. No
intervention was done at that time. Patient initially required
vigorous intravenous hydration to maintain good blood pressure but
remained essentially stable and pain free. He had a drop in his
hematocrit from 35 on admission to 28 after his catheterization
secondary to blood loss at the right femoral triple-lumen site
placed in the Emergency Ward prior to TPA , blood loss at
catheterization , small hematoma , and dilution. He was given two
units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in his
hematocrit. The patient was then transferred to the floor where he
maintained his good course. He had no postcatheterization or
postmyocardial infarction chest pain. The decision was then made
to take the patient back to the catheterization laboratory to have
PTCA with stenting of his lesion and to see if it continued to
persist. The patient was taken on the day prior to discharge back
to the catheterization laboratory where he was successfully
angioplastied and stented. Immediately on returning to the floor ,
the patient did have a rigor postcatheterization but he remained
afebrile and did well over the remainder of his hospital course.
It was felt that the rigor was probably related to allergic
reaction to the dye as he was treated with Benadryl and steroids
without complication.
DISPOSITION: The patient will have visiting nurse services. He
will have blood drawn to check platelets in two days
as he had a fall in his platelet level to 60 after the
administration of the reapro. He will also need follow-up CBC in
two and four weeks because he is on ticlid.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , sublingual
nitroglycerin p.r.n. chest pain , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and
ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. to complete a two week course.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Marvin Snachez ,
cardiologist with EANH .  He will have echocardiogram
done on his first hospital visit. The patient will also follow-up
with Dr. Lorenzo Campoverde in the clinical trial center as follow-up for
his participation in the OERD HOSPITAL study.

Discharge Date: 5/28/1999
CHIEF COMPLAINT: This patient presented with an acute stroke and
was brought in by her daughter.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Sixty-six year old obese African
American woman of previous CVA of
unclear etiology and unclear clinical sequelae. She was driving as
a passenger in a car around 11:00 o'clock in the morning and
experienced a sudden speech arrest which was witnessed by her
daughter-in-law. She has also difficulty moving her right arm and
she had some tearing of her left eye as well as a skewed look on
her face. By 11:40 a.m. , the ambulance had arrived and she was
admitted to the Koote Hospital emergency department
where the protocol for acute stroke was instituted. The patient
had a CTA done which showed questionable luminal narrowing of the
distal left middle cerebral artery. CT scan was normal and the
patient was given intravenous TPA at 1323 p.m. She was given a 9
mg bolus dose over two minutes and 81 mg given over the following
hour. She was transferred to the neuro. intensive care unit of
Ham Tertnough Memorial Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY; Diet controlled diabetes , obesity ,
hypertension as per the Rinn Maield Pinessi Hospital internal
medicine associate records. She also has history of ulcerative
colitis and is on treatment. She is status post MI in 1988 and
there is question of an old stroke in the past. There is also
question of asthma.
MEDICATIONS: Currently is aspirin 325 mg and Asacol although she
wasn't sure of the dose.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Nonsmoker , married with several children. At
baseline , she is wheelchair dependent due to
chronic hip and back pain although she ambulates at home.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Revealed chronic mild shortness of breath.
FAMILY HISTORY: There was no significant other family history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION; Blood pressure is 138/76 , heart rate was 80
and paced. She was an obese lady lying on
her back. HEAD AND NECK: Revealed no evidence of trauma. There
were no bruits in the neck. CHEST: Clear. There were bilateral
wheezes. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Normal , obese
with no edema. NEURO: The patient is awake and alert , looking
around. She was mute however. She was able to follow one step
commands. She had a question of a right field compromise
difficulty crossing the midline. She had a right upper motor
neuron seventh weakness with decreased power on the right side of
the face. She had flaccid right arm. Her right leg had some power
with flexion at the knee but was generally weak. She had optimum
coordination and absent pinprick and proprioception on the right.
All of this was documented at 12:30 a.m. By 14;30 a.m. , after the
patient was given intravenous TPA , the patient's language had
returned completely to normal. She had normal speech including
comprehension and naming. Her ability to distinguish left from
right was intact. Her repetition was intact. SHe had full range of
movement of the eyes with full fields of confrontation. She had a
mild right arm drift on the right side but her strength was 4+/5
distally and proximally. There was normal power in the right lower
lobe and the plantars were normal. There was no increase in
reflexes. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit
for the neurological service of Teaspell Diee Hospital .
HOSPITAL COURSE: Blood pressure monitoring was instituted per
protocol , nasal oxygen was given and no antiplatelet
therapy was given for 24 hours. Head of bed was raised to 30
degrees. Head CT was repeated the following morning , the results
of which show that there is slight left basal ganglion internal
capsule , acute and subacute infarct in the left middle cerebral
artery distribution which was evolving from the previous study.
THere was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. The patient had
further investigations to look for a cause of this presumed embolic
stroke. She had an echocardiogram done which showed the aortic
root at 3.5 cm , the atrium at 3.2 which is slightly dilated. There
was normal ventricular size and overall preserved systolic
function , trace aortic insufficiency , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation ,
trace mitral regurgitation. Holter monitor was done which showed
persistent atrial flutter. The patient was coumadinized and some
discussion pertaining to cardioversion was entertained by the
electrophysiology service. However , this was not done as an
inpatient. The patient continued to do remarkably well after her
intravenous thrombolysis over the next couple of days. She had
persistent drift on the right arm; however , her speech remained
completely normal. SHe was reviewed by the chronic pain service on
several occasions for chronic back and leg pain. She reached
normal levels of Coumadin within several days and was discharged
without rehabilitation. She will be followed by the cardiac
service and a plan for complete cardioversion was instituted within
one month. The patient went home on Coumadin. She was finally
discharged on 5/11/99 .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 60 year old female with a history of breast cancer and
chemotherapy induced CMP( EF 20% , followed by CMP clinic; on 2 L O2 at
night ) , COPD , s/p DVT now anticoagulated , HTN , afib , DM , admitted
with presumed CHF flare. Ms. Guerena was recently admitted for
CHF flare and received intravenous diuresis. She reponded well and
was discharged at a dry weight of approximately 185 pounds. Ms.
Kimmell presented on this admission with 2 days of increasing SOB ,
abdominal discomfort , nausea and vomitting. She denied increasing
edema , change in number of pillows. She did endorse PND present but
states that it is unchanged. In ED , the patient was afebile , inital
ly with oxygen saturation in the high 90's on 2 L. BP 154/84. BNP was
greater than 3000. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Abdominal CT was
obtained due to concern for the patients abdominal pain and showed
an engorged , fatty liver , ascites , pleural effusions ( not seen
on CXR ). A surgical consult was obtained and the surgeons felt the
patients abdominal pain was not surgical in nature but rather secondary
to CHF.
Hospital Course:
1 ) Cardiovascular: a ) Pump- CHF exacerbation. We diuresed the patient
initially with intravenous lasix until her respiratory status
imroved and the patient was able to maintain good oxygen saturation on
room air. At the time of discharge her oxygen saturation on room air
was in the high 90's and was between 94-96 % with ambulation. We
continued the patient's home doses of beta blocker , angiotension
receptor blocker and statin. The patient was again encouraged to
adhere to a low-salt diet and weight herself daily. The patient will be
discharged on Torsemide 100 mg po q am and 50 mg po q pm , a regimine t
has worked will for the patient in the past. She will f/uw iht the
Naiimo Hospital CHF Clinic ( Harold Gohring ) on 5/6 at 10:30 am. The
patient will be followed by Rangespo Chica Li VNA who will assist in her CHF
monitoring and assess her for home PT. b ) Rhythm- The
pa tient is know to have frequent PVCs and non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia which was agian noted on this admission on telemetry.
She was asymptomatic with the NSVT and remains hemodynamically stable.
We obtained an electrophysiology consult to evaluate the need for an
AICD or biventricular pacing. The patietns electrolytes and magnesium
were monitored and rempleted and she was maintained on a beta blocker.
On 2/14 the EP service placed a VVI/R ICD device without complications.
It was interogated ont he day of d/c and the patietn was provided with
written instructions from the EP service for d/c. She will follow-up
with the Dr. Cradduck on 10/30 as described. c ) Ischemia:
Patient with a history of CAD.
ED initially concerned for a myocardial infarction. She was ruled o
ut for an MI with negative cardiac enzymes x 3. Serial EKG's
were unchanged. We continued the patient on ASA , beta blocker , s
tatin and ARB. 2 )Heme: Ms. Egerton has a history of DVT , therapeutic
on coumadin at the time of admission. We did decreased her
dose while being treated with levofloxacin. In addition her coumadin
was held for her EP procedure. At the time of d/c she will be
resuming her regular dose of coumadin and should follow-up at her
usualy JMC lab to have her INR checked on Thursday 5/6 .  3 )ID: +UA on
admission treated for three days with levofloxacin. ( Last day was
11/19/4 ). Her cx grew citrobacter which was sensitive to levo. Repeat
UA was negative. 4 ) GI: Abdominal discomfort presumably due
to hepatic congestion. Abdominal CT showed no acute surgical process.
Abdominal pain was resolved with diuresis. She does have a
chronic elevated alk phos which may be related to her
sarcoid. 6 )Endocrine: Continued
levoxyl for the patient's hypothyroid. Pt with IDDM. We decreased
her lantus dose from 50 u sc to 30 u sc on admission as po
intake was initially low. Pt can resume regular
insulin dose after discharge when she resumes her
outpatient eating habits. 7 ) General: PT consulted to assist in
prevention deconditioning while in the hospital. VNA will evaluate need
for home PT services.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Weight yourself daily , call your doctor when your weight increases
2. Follow-up with your Primary Care Physician in 2 weeks
3. Follow-up at the CHF clinic on Thursday 5/6 with Jeffry Vaudrain at
10:30am.

100 mg po everynight.
5. Follow-up with Dr. Newsome ( 396 )540-2094 3/11 at 9:30 am for your ICD.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Keep appointments as outlined above.
2. Have your INR checked on Friday 5/6 .
3. Weight yourself daily. Call your PCP if your weight increases.
4. Follow written EP discharge instructions.
5. Fort VNA will resume services adn follow pt for CHF as well as

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67 year old female
with multiple medical problems ,
including coronary artery disease , status post stent to the left
circumflex in 1999 , silent MI in 1990 , hypertension , type II
diabetes , and hypercholesterolemia , who presented to an outside
hospital with acute onset of shortness of breath that occurred
while the patient was watching T.V. This dyspnea was associated
with chest heaviness , but the patient denies nausea , diaphoresis ,
or radiation. The patient reports similar symptoms when she
presented in 4/5 to an outside hospitalization and was ultimately
stented for a left circumflex lesion. On the day of admit , the
patient was seen at the Odaughters Nyco Centspan Hospital , where she was
apparently in respiratory distress , and treated with oxygen ,
nitroglycerin , aspirin , Lasix , CPAP , and morphine. Chest x-ray , by
report , showed CHF. The patient improved with diuresis and was
admitted on a R/O protocol for flash pulmonary edema. Her
troponin-I and initial two CKs were flat. She was then transferred
here for cardiac cath , as cardiac ischemia was the suspected
culprit for her presentation. The patient states she sleeps with
one pillow. She has no PND or palpitations. She further denies
fevers , chills , constipation , nausea , vomiting , cough , bright red
blood per rectum , melena , or dysuria. The patient denies diet or
medicine indiscretion. The patient has had no further chest pain
or shortness of breath since the day she was admitted to the
outside hospital.

LABORATORY DATA: Na 136 , K 4.3 , Cl 100 , bicarb 25 , BUN 36 ,
creatinine 1.5 , glucose 162. ALT 6 , AST 10 , CK
45 , alk phos 40 , T. bili 0.3 , D. bili 0.1 , albumin 3.6 , mag 1.7 ,
troponin-I 0.05. White count 8.4 , hematocrit 31.3 , platelets 298 ,
MCV 88 , RDW 13. PT 11.6 , INR 0.9 , PTT 25.1. Urinalysis showed 1+
protein , 3+ blood , 2+ leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 35-40
white cells , 80-85 red cells , 1+ bacteria , 1+ epi , no casts. EKG ,
on admission , showed a normal sinus rhythm at 70 , LVH with probable
strain laterally. No significant changes from an EKG done on
1/25/99 .  Of note , an EKG done at the outside hospital on 2/10
showed inverted Ts in I , L , and V2-V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to this hospital with a
recent episode of flash pulmonary edema. When
this had happened previously , cardiac catheterization had revealed
an occluded left circumflex lesion that was stented. There were ,
therefore , concerns that the patient may have re-occlusion either
of the stent or of one of her other vessels. Her metformin was
held. She was given pre-cath hydration fluids , and then she
underwent cardiac catheterization. The results of this study were
as follows: The patient had a 40% ostial LAD lesion and an 80% mid
D1 lesion , both of which showed no change from her prior
catheterization. The patient left circumflex stent was widely
patent. The patient's RCA was noted to be occluded and was filling
with collaterals from left to right. At the time of the
catheterization , the patient's renal arteries are also evaluated.
There was a question of an ostial left renal artery stenosis.
However , no other renal disease was noted.
Because the patient's catheterization was unchanged from a prior
study , it was unclear as to the significance of her D1 lesion. For
this reason , the patient underwent an ETT MIBI , the results of
which are as follows: The patient underwent a modified Bruce ,
heart rate of 66% of maximum predicted heart rate. She exercised
for 4 minutes 30 seconds and stopped secondary to dyspnea. She had
no new EKG changes and no chest pain. The MIBI portion of the test
showed a nontransmural anterior and inferior MI , with peri-infarct
ischemia involving 3-5 segments. At the time of this dictation , it
is felt that the patient's CAD is an unlikely explanation for her
presentation. Dr. Dibernardo will review the MIBI results and decide
whether a repeat catheterization with PCI is warranted. The most
likely explanation is that the patient has diastolic dysfunction
given her age and history of diabetes. Dr. Hake is interested in
enrolling her in a study that evaluates angiotensin receptor
blockers in treatment of this disorder.
The patient had an echo during this hospitalization. The left
ventricle is mildly dilated with an EF of 50%. The patient has
apical , septal , and lateral hypokinesis. Her right ventricle size
and function is normal. The patient also has a dilated left atrium
with mild mitral regurgitation.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow-up with her primary care
physician in two weeks and her primary
cardiologist in four weeks.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.
Please note that an addendum to this discharge summary will be
added with the patient's discharge medications.

Assessment and Plan: This is an 81 year old female with multiple
medical problems who presents with multiple vague complaints. She likely
has more than one medical issue going on simultaneously.
--
CV:
ISCHEMIA: Pt has known CAD. Worsening angina with exertion. No s/s
of ACS currently. EKG shows no ST segment elevations. Checked set of
cardiac enzymes which were negative. She was continued on asa , statin , BB
-
PUMP: The pt has history of diastolic heart failure. ECHO over one year
ago showed EF 55-60%. It also showed severe tricuspid regurgitation. Her
symptoms of DOE , fatigue , LE swelling , abd girth could also be explained
by Cor Pulmonale or worsening heart failure. A CXR was performed
which showed stable cardiomegaly and no signs of overt edema but
clinically with her elevated JVP , increased abd girth and LE edema
were suggestive of fluid overload. BNP was low at 122 but likely she was
somewhat overloaded. An ECHO was performed which showed elevated
pulm artery pressure of 45 , moderate tricuspid regurgitation , mild to
moderately enlarged R ventricle and moderately enlarged Right atrium. EF
of 60%. These findings are suggestive of potential cor pulmonale. Plan is
to diurese pt as outpt and repeat ECHO by PCP as outpt , then
consideration of cardiology referral. Lisinopril is added as allergy
( hyperkalemia ) , perhaps can be given as small dose with close monitoring.
Defer to PCP. The pt was placed on strict I/Os , daily weights. Avoided
fluid restriction given low BP for now.
-
RHYTHM: The pt has fatigue , dizziness , nausea raising the concern for
dig toxicity. She also has known afib. A digoxin level was checked and
came back at 1.4 which might be slightly high for her renal function ,
age and muscle mass. Her digoxin dose was therefore decreased to 0.125mg
daily. She was monitored on telemetry which showed frequent ventricular
pacing and occasional PVCs.
---
ORTHO: The pt had CT of cervical spine in October '07 for neck pain
radiating to the L , as is her current presentation. The CT showed DJD
but no fracture or other concerning finding. No recent trauma. Her pain
is likely from worsening DJD. Plan conservative intervention with
hotpacks , Tylenol. No further imaging indicated. Home PT planned.
---
NEURO: The pt has hx of CVA but current CTA shows no evidence of
acute CVA. Her Neuro exam is fairly unremarkable despite multiple
vague complaints of weakness , numbness , pain. She was continued on
asa. Neuro exam monitored without focal deficits. Treated headache with
Tylenol. If the pt's overall pain persists , she might benefit from pain
consult as outpt
---
PULM: Pt has no known pulm disease but has been prescribed albuterol
inhaler. If she in fact has pulm HTN , she may have causative pulm
etiology. CXR showed no acute pulm issues. If ECHO suggestive , PFTs as
outpt per PCP.
---
GI: Bowel regimen for constipation. PPI for GERD.
---
ENDO: Pt has IDDM. It is not exactly clear what she takes for insulin at
home because she reports that she only takes NPH once a day despite the
prescription in WBMC .  She is unclear on her doses or timing of insulin.
She was hypoglycemic upon admission. Check Hgb A1C--> 7.4. She was
started on Sliding scale Novolog and AM NPH for the time being. Monitored
FS which were reasonable. PCP to cont management.
---
FEN: Monitored fluid status. Monitored lytes. Avoided K scale while
on digoxin. Low fat , Low chol , NAS , carb controlled diet
---
PPX: Lovenox
CODE: Full
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. VNA to help with medication reconcilliation. VNA-please go through all
medication bottles in the house and sort out the current ones , help
patient make pill box with most current medications.
2. Digoxin dose has been lowered this admission from 0.25mg to 0.125mg
daily. Lasix has been increased temporarily to BID for diuresis until
follow up with PCP.
3. VNA to check sodium , potassium and digoxin level June .
4. VNA to check BP while on bid lasix. Hold dose if SBP <95 and call PCP.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Monitor fluid status/electrolytes. Repeat ECHO after diuresis. Consider
Cardiology consult for ?Cor Pulmonale.
Monitor renal function and digoxin level.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a 66 yo woman with a hx of CAD , emphysema , HTN , and DMII
who presents with a 2 month hx of progressive dyspnea on exertion who
was found to desat on ambulation today to the mid 80s. The patient had
a prior CABG in 1994 and underwent cath with additionally stenting in
2001. She had a recent MIBI ( 5/26 ) with nl EF and mild reversible
defects in peri-infarct territory. She had been doing well until
recently when she noted the onset of progressive dyspnea on exertion
over the last 2 months. She denies chest pain , cough , orthopnea. She
does report PND and new LE edema.
VS: 96.6 61 140/70 24 94 RA
PEx: Lungs: bilateral basilar crackles. CV: rrr , nl s1 and s2 , +s3 ,
II/VI SEM. Extr: bilateral edema over shins , non-pitting.
Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea: The differential diagnosis for this patient's dyspnea
includes cardiac and pulmonary causes. Based on physical exam it was
not felt that she was in heart failure. However , with hx of CAD , this
was investigated with Echo which showd nl EF and heart function. The
Echo also showed nl RV fxn and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
Chronic PE and lung parechymal diseases were investigated with chest CT
which was negative for PE. It also showed moderate to severe
centrilobular emphysema with no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis. She
had PFTs the day of admission which showed decreased lung volumes all
consistent with a restrictive lung pattern. Given the diagnostic
dilemma , the Pulmonary service was consulted , which did not feel that
doe was due solely to pulm etiologies. Thus , desat is unexplained. Pt
will be sent home on o2 to be used during exertion only.
2. CV: The patient has a hx of hypertension and is being followed by
her Cardiologist Dr. Stouch . Per Dr. Hehr recommendation , her norvasc
was discontinued as was her atenolol. Desats could be
due to transient diastolic dysfunction w/ exertion. She has been
started on labetalol 400 bid at the time of discharge. Titrate up as BP
tolerates
3. PULM: will be d/c'd on albuterol inh.
4. F/U: She is discharged to home with follow-up w/ urgent care next wk
for re-exam of BP , volume status and sats w/ ambulation. Titrate
labetalol as tolerated. If LE edema persists and pt continues to desat
w/ exertion , can try lasix. If DOE still persists , consider R/L heart
cath or cardiopulmonary exercise testing
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: if you have any worsening shortness of breath , call MD immediately.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Follow-up with Dr. Paasch on January as scheduled.
2. Call Dr. Fupocyupanqui to schedule follow-up.
3. Call doctors if symptoms worsen.
4. The following are med changes:
- stop norvasc
- stop atenolol
- start labetalol 200 mg twice a day

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
69 yo female with NIDDM , HTN , obese , former smoker admit two weeks ago
after discharge for positive stress test. In October , during
dobutamine part of MIBI pt had severe SOB with desat to 60s , ruled in
for NQWMI , refused cardiac cath or further evaluation. Pt now
readmitted with several days of nausea-like epigastric sensation
following meals , esp fatty/caffeine meals , decreased PO intake , then
on day PTA with profound nausea , diaphoresis and SOB while ambulating.
EXTREMELY difficult by history to differentiate cardiac vs GI etiology.
On examination only tachycardic , no signs failure. Plan was to treat
as cardiac disease , and evaluate for GI cause. Pt's lopressor was dose
adjusted for tachycarida , continued on ASA , ACE , nitrates. Pt not
anticoagulated. Cardiology consult felt new symptoms were GI and did
not recommend in-house cardiac catherization. Pt was started on
increased dose of prilosec for presumed gastritis with no evidence of
GIB by hct and heme negative stools. Presumed cause was home asa and
prednisone use. Pt will consider outpatient cardiac catherization and
intervention. She is scheduled to see Dr. Kallam in 2 weeks and Dr.
Drissel promptly after that.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please call your physician with any chest pain that is new , different
in quality , or if accompanied by shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting.
Please record the timing and nature of your symptoms if you continue to
have them. Also please record what makes them come and what makes them
go away.

Discharge Date: 10/10/1992
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 37 year old woman
with dilated cardiomyopathy admitted
with positional chest pain associated with viral prodrome. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY revealed the patient was diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy in 10-89. She was worked up at the Ingvid's Health Services with a conclusion of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ,
work-up unavailable. The patient was discharged on Lasix , digoxin
and an ACE inhibitor. In 15 of April , the patient was admitted to Orecross Medical Center after complaining of positional chest pain ,
shortness of breath and fatigue. She was diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy and received an echocardiogram , which revealed large
ventricles , 2+ mitral regurgitation , 3+ tricuspid regurgitation. In
23 of June , the patient underwent a bicycle exercise tolerance test and
endured 10 minutes and 16 seconds , limited by fatigue. Peak heart
rate was 104 , peak blood pressure was 156/80 , she had a few atrial
premature beats and no ischemic ST-T changes. Her oxygen uptake
was 16.2 milliliters per kilogram per minute. In 24 of November , the patient
underwent right ventriculogram which showed ejection fraction 24%
and global hypokinesis. On the day of admission , on 11 of January , the
patient complained of 4 days of diarrhea , nausea , vomiting and
malaise , followed by sharp severe chest pain in the mid chest below
the left breast radiating to the back , which was relieved by lying
on the left and aggravated by leaning forward or lying on the
right , also worsened by deep breathing and cough , and also with
ventral palpation. The patient claimed that the pain had never
gone away in the past 12 hours , but again was aggravated by certain
positions. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was significant for
cardiomyopathy , hypertension , gastritis , ex-intravenous drug abuser
for 10 years , anemia , and recent crack cocaine use. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION included Lasix , Enalapril and digoxin. ALLERGIES were no
known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese black woman in no
apparent distress. Blood pressure was
162/100 , heart rate 90 , respiratory rate 24 , oxygen saturation 99% ,
no pulsus. Eyes were pupils were equal , round , reactive to light ,
extraocular movements intact , muddy sclera. Neck was supple ,
jugular venous pressure was 8 to 10 centimeters , carotids were 2+
bilaterally. Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion
except for a few bibasilar crackles. Heart showed normal S1 and
S2 , no rubs , distant heart sounds , no murmurs were noted. Abdomen
was obese , soft , normal bowel sounds , she was comfortable with deep
palpation diffusely. Extremities showed no edema. Rectal
examination was guaiac negative. Neurologic examination was
nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium was 137 , potassium 2.7 , chloride
92 , bicarbonate 37 , blood urea nitrogen 7 ,
creatinine .9 , glucose 159 , AST 58 , creatinine phosphokinase 641 ,
with 23% myocardial bands. White count was 4.6 , hematocrit 31.5 ,
platelets 166 , 000 , ESR 60 , prothrombin time 11.3 , partial
thromboplastin time 18. Chest x-ray showed a big heart with mild
congestive heart failure. The electrocardiogram showed T-wave
inversions in I , II , F , L , V2 through V6 , consistent with a 1990
electrocardiogram done when she was complaining of positional chest
pain similar to the chest pain she is having now.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with the thought that
her history was consistent with pericarditis , but
was also worriesome for ischemia given her elevated creatinine
phosphokinase with myocardial band fraction of 23 , and her history
of cocaine abuse. Her hospital course was consistent with
continuation of her pain through the first day of hospitalization
despite and aggressive anti-ischemic regimen. It was found that
hermyocardial band electrophoresis showed no myocardial band
fraction detected , and it was decided that we would shift our
therapy to a more anti-inflammatory regimen to control her
pericarditis. At that time , Indocin was started and the chest pain
resolved. With the resolution of her chest pain , the T-wave
inversions corrected. The patient was transerred to the floor on
Indocin 50 milligrams 3 times a day , aspirin , Bactrim , Enalapril
and Carafate and remained without chest pain for the next 2 days.
She was also seen by the ACE team in consultation about her drug
and alcohol problem , and it was decided that she would be
discharged on 21 of January , after arrangement for follow-up with the ACE
team.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE included aspirin , Indocin 50 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , Enalapril 10 milligrams by mouth each day ,
Carafate 1 gram by mouth 4 times a day. The patient is to
FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Dewitt A. Sisler .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
HPI: Ms. Phetteplace is a 70 yo woman with h/o Cardiac Transplant 1992 , s/p
PCI/Stent 6/19 with 80% lesion LCx s/p R Carotid stent placement 6/19 ,
h/o DM , HTN , Hyperlipidemia , Smoking , now s/p L Carotid Stent Placement
10/24/06 .  During annual follow up in 9/30 of her heart transplant , a
complex eccentric 80% lesion was noted in the proximal LCx. She was
admitted in January electively with plans for cardiac cath/PCI/stent.
However in the interim period , she had a symptomatic LUE numbness thought
to be a TIA , concerning for R carotid stenosis.An MRI revealed bilateral
tight carotid stenosis. The LCx and Symptomatic R Carotid artery
underwent cath/stent placement in 6/19 .  However , intervention on her
left internal carotid artery ( though 90% occluded by cath ) was deferred
due to already receiving 2 angiographikc procedures during the 6/19
admission. At this time she was tapered off cell-cept and started on
rapamycin - in hopes of slowing progression in her coronary disease. She
then returned to medical attention on 19 of April for catheterization/stent
placement on Left Carotid Artery. During these procedure , a hematoma
developed at the L femoral access site which was managed with compression
during the case. FSBS was 384 prior to the procedure and elevated to 547
during the procedure ( she received D5W+HCO3 during the procedure. ) She

3. Endo: During hospitalization and prior/during procedures has had poor
glucose controls with FSBS in 300s-400s. Patient reports poor glycemic
control at home with FSBS in 300s. AM FSBS was 384 and received D5NS
prior to procedure , exacerbating hyperglycemia. Endocrinconsulted and
recommended Qday lantus injection with with Novolog sliding scale + AC
while in house. HbA1c @ 11 ( markedly worse than 6 in January ) - patient can
not identify other factors which have changed since January other than
immunosuppressants to rapamycin. FSBS were difficult to control in house
despite using 20 QDay of lantus , Ms. Nickodem FSBS continued to run in
the 200s-300s during the day. She was taught to inject herself with
insulin SC during her stay. She is discharged on Glyburide 10 QDay and
Lantus 20 QDay. She was taught to keep a diary and will follow up with her
PCP.
4. Neuro: TIA/CVA in 6/19 .  residual Left numbness/weakness in hand. On

5. Immunosuppression: As above , have changed immunosuppression from
Rapamycin + Cyclosporine back to Cyclosporine 75 BID +Cellcept 1000 BID as
patient performed priorto 6/19 .
6. MSK/Rheum: The patient previously complained of myalgias with statins and
was resistant to starting statins because they seemed to worsen her
aches/pains. Rheumatology service was consulted. They believed her pain
is not consistent with statin associated myalgia. Zetia was stopped and
she was started on Pravachol 20 mg QHS.
Her back pain is relieved by leaning forward and she walks at Arkansas
with a shopping cart for exercise which is consistent with spinal stenosis.
They recommended physical therapy and MRI imaging of her back. The MRI
preliminary read shows multilevel degenerative disc disease and moderate
spinal stenosis at one level. Physical therapy saw her and thought she
would benefit from home PT in the future--she was given a prescription for
outpatient physical therapy.
Since she is on long term prednisone she should have a DEXA scan and may
benefit from bisphosphonate therapy.

Discharge Date: 10/20/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
OTHER PROBLEMS: Diabetes , asthma , smoking , GI bleeding of unknown
etiology , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 71-year-old man with
coronary artery disease with risk
factors of diabetes , hypertension , cigarette smoking , and a report
of hypercholesterolemia. The patient has reported a history of
angina over the past several years which was well controlled by
nitroglycerin. In October of 1997 , he was able to exercise 3
minutes of the Bruce protocol with maximum heart rate of 79 and a
blood pressure of over 80 with no evidence of ischemia on EKG. An
echo at that time was also normal. About a month prior to
admission , the patient began experiencing progressive chest pain
which seemed related to exertion. He described the chest pain as
burning and radiating to his neck. The patient has a history of
gastroesophageal reflux , and was referred for EGD , but this test
was postponed until a further workup of the patient's chest pain.
At baseline he reports exercise-related chest pain everyday as well as
occasional chest pain at rest relieved by about 3-5 nitroglycerin. These
episodes are associated with diaphoresis , shortness of breath , but no nausea or
vomiting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,
gastritis , GERD , GI bleed in February of
1999 , nephrolithiasis , diabetes , history of atrial fibrillation ,
asthma , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Cardizem , Klonopin , aspirin , Prilosec ,
Paxil , nitroglycerin , p.r.n. , Azmacort ,
albuterol , Mevacor , iron , NPH.
ALLERGIES: None known.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Afebrile , pulse 71 , blood pressure 107/53 ,
satting 97%on room air. Pertinent positive
include occasional bilateral wheezes on lung exam. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Regular rate , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
NECK: No evidence of JVD and no carotid bruits. ABDOMEN: Benign.
EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis , clubbing or edema , and dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibialis pulses were 2+ bilaterally. RECTAL:
Significant for guaiac-positive dark brown stool.
ADMISSION LABORATORY: Significant for hematocrit of 29.4 , with an
MCV of 78 , cardiac enzymes were negative on
admission.
EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 70. No
significant ST or T wave abnormalities.
PROCEDURES: Cardiac catheterization status post right coronary
artery stent was performed during the patient's
hospital stay. No complications resulted from this procedure.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular. On February , the patient had an exercise
treadmill test Bruce protocol. He exercised for 2 minutes and 30
seconds achieving a maximum heart rate of 104 with maximum blood
pressure of 130/90 , however , the test was terminated at low
exercise level for shortness of breath an leg fatigue. No EKG
changes were noted during this test. Since this test was nondiagnostic , the
patient was scheduled for a dobutamine MIBI. This test showed a significant
area of ischemia in the inferior and apical regions of the heart. An
echocardiogram performed also showed an area of hypokinesis in the inferior
region of the heart. Cardiac catheterization performed on February showed
100% occlusion of the LAD and 75% occlusion of the right coronary
artery with stent placement. Prior to stent placement , Mr. Niesborella
had two episodes of chest pain in the hospital which resolved with
nitroglycerin. He had no chest pain following stent placement. He also had
transient episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter.
2. Gastrointestinal. Mr. Tangerman was noted to guaiac positive on
admission. He also reported some symptoms consistent with
gastroesophageal reflux. While in inpatient , his Prilosec was
increased at 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. He was followed by GI while in
inpatient and it was recommended that he have a repeat EGD and
colonoscopy as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1 ) ATRIAL FLUTTER. 2 ) LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Gerald Leonardo Vasguez is a 56-year-old man
with a history significant for a coronary artery bypass grafting
approximately one month ago with mitral valve annuloplasty ,
diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented with a cough. The
patient had recently been evaluated on 9/21/99 for cough and was
treated for a pneumonia with levofloxacin.
The patient stated that his cough and malaise began approximately
one week after discharge postoperatively. He stated that his cough
was constant , worsened at night , with some small clear sputum.
Denied any hemoptysis or fevers. He also denied sick contacts. No
nausea and vomiting or diarrhea. The patient had also noted
increased leg swelling over the past several weeks. In addition
the patient was complaining of some orthopnea as well as PND.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Coronary artery disease , status post
coronary artery bypass grafting 4/5 ( left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , SVG to PDA , OM
[with mitral valve annuloplasty]. 2 ) Diabetes mellitus. 3 )
Hypertension.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Enteric coated aspirin , Zantac ,
Coumadin , Colace , Niferex , Vasotec and
NPH insulin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married , no alcohol , no smoking.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission. Temperature 97.9 , pulse 111 ,
blood pressure 133/86 , room air sat 96
percent. General - No acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal , round
and reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. Jugular
venous distention 15 centimeters , no lymphadenopathy. Lungs
decreased breath sounds at base with bilaterally crackles on the
left a third of the way up. Cardiovascular - tachycardic , normal
S1S2. Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended. Extremities 3+ lower
extremity edema to the mid thigh. Venous stasis changes on the
shins. Neuro nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , creatinine 1.2 ,
glucose 103 , WBC 5.5 , hematocrit 32.4 , platelets
37.6 , CK 113 , Troponin 1.03.
Chest x-ray - left-sided pleural effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Alexander Chadwick Rucker was admitted for increasing
cough , left lower extremity edema for presumed
congestive heart failure exacerbation. Hospital course by systems:
1 ) Cardiovascular. The patient was noted to be in new onset
congestive heart failure. He was aggressively diuresed. It was
noted on admission that patient was in atrial flutter with pacing
at a rate of approximately 110-120. An electrophysiology consult
was obtained and pacer was interrogated and mode changed to DDI
from DDD. The patient was loaded on digoxin and subsequently
spontaneously reverted to normal sinus rhythm.
2 ) Pulmonary. The patient was noted to have a persistent pleural
effusion that was new since the patient's coronary artery bypass
graft one month previous. Although it was suspected that this was
likely secondary to congestive heart failure or perhaps
postoperative pleural effusion , etiology was unclear. A pulmonary
consult was obtained. The patient did undergo a
diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis of 500 cc of fluid. Analysis
of the fluid showed a pH of 7.48 , total protein of 4.8 ( serum total
protein 7.6 ) , LDH of 158 ( serum LDH 228 ) ,
glucose 135 , amylase 33 with 600 white blood cells , 6 polys , 0
bands , 56 lymphs , 13 monos , 18 macrophages and 7 , 000 red blood
cells. No PMNs were noted. Cytology was still pending at the time
of discharge. Though the pleural effusion did meet criteria for an
exudate , this was difficult to interpret in light of the patient's
recent aggressive diuresis. As fluid did not appear to be
inspected. A PPD with control was planted which was negative ,
however controls were also anergic. Sputum cultures were negative.
It was felt that the patient would likely benefit from repeat
thoracentesis to remove enough fluid so that subsequently chest CT
could be performed. This was to be pursued as an outpatient.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on 7/27/99 with a home
VNA and physical therapy services for vital signs
monitoring and post coronary artery bypass graft rehab services.
FOLLOWUP: The patient was to follow up with Dr. Ladika on 3/5/99
in the chest diseases clinic , as well as with Dr.
Thayne , his outpatient cardiologist. He was also to be seen in
Coumadin clinic.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d.; digoxin
0.125 mg q.d.; Lasix 80 mg q.d.; NPH
insulin 20 units q. a.m. , 10 units q. p.m.; Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.;

DEATH SUMMARY
DATE OF DEATH:
5/23/06 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Zicherman was a 59-year-old who was admitted to Dalewan on 7/25/06 from an outside hospital with a
deteriorating ischemic cardiomyopathy. He had a myocardial infarction in 1996
and subsequently had coronary artery bypass grafting also in 1996 with
subsequent occlusion of two grafts. He had four previous stents in native
vessels , had a biventricular ICD placed in 2000 , and he also had a history of
hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
He was admitted with increasing signs and symptoms of heart failure and had
gone from class I failure to class IV over the 18 months prior to admission. He
was noted to have a BNP of 1600 and was being treated for pneumonia on
admission. He was initially evaluated for heart transplantation , but due to
clinical deterioration was considered for ventricular assist device. He
required inotropic support prior to surgery. There is no other surgical
history of note.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
As mentioned , also a history of mild polycythemia
and thrombocytopenia.
FAMILY / SOCIAL HISTORY:
Both parents had coronary artery bypass grafts. He had an
80-pack-year cigarette smoking history.
DRUG HISTORY:
At the time of assessment , he was receiving amiodarone 200 mg
three times a day , digoxin 0.125 mg once daily , aspirin 81 mg
once daily , heparin continuous infusion , Lasix continuous
infusion , dobutamine continuous infusion , milrinone continuous
infusion , spironolactone 25 mg once daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Examination revealed a midline sternotomy , respiratory crackles
bilaterally and a pansystolic murmur.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
On 6/16/06 , he underwent cardiac catheterization which showed
complete occlusion of OM2 , proximal RCA , proximal LAD , 90%
occlusion of the D1 , 100% occlusion of the ramus , 100% occlusion
of OM1. His LIMA to LAD graft was patent. He had a complete
occlusion of vein graft to RCA , 50% occlusion of vein graft to
D2. He was also noted to have pulmonary hypertension with mean
PA pressure of 48 mmHg and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of
33. His cardiac output was 3.5 liters on dobutamine and
milrinone infusions. Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction
of 15% , trivial AI , mild MR , moderate TR. EKG revealed atrial
flutter at a rate of 104. Chest x-ray was consistent with
congestive heart failure.
On 11/22/06 , he underwent reoperative insertion of a HeartMate left ventricular
assist device and tricuspid valvuloplasty. He was unable to tolerate
chest closure at the end of procedure as his central venous
pressure was high.
Postoperatively he was coagulopathic and inotrope and nitric oxide dependant.
On postoperative day #2 , some progress was made weaning inotropes and on
postoperative day #3 , he had a chest closure with a pericardial patch. He also
underwent exploratory laparotomy and sustained a VT arrest requiring
discontinuation of cardioversion. He continued to require nitric
oxide in view of high pulmonary vascular resistance. On 6/13/06 , he had a
further episodes of ventricular fibrillation and had multiple electrical
cardioversions and required amiodarone and epinephrine. Eventually , he
converted to AV paced rhythm. At this time , he required continued to require
significant inotropic support. He subsequently continued to have multiple
episodes of ventricular fibrillation which were converted with his AICD. At
this stage due to his ongoing hemodynamic instability , he was paralysed with
Nimbex , and his nitric oxide was increased for ongoing pulmonary hypertension.
He continued to be hemodynamically ustable. On postoperative day #5 ,
he developed cool and dusky extremities and was started on
bivalirudin although at this stage his HIT screen was negative. He also became
febrile with temperatures to 103. On postoperative days #6 , 7 and 8 , his PA
pressures slowly began to improve and some slow progress was made weaning his
epinephrine. At this stage , his bilirubin began to increase and he developed
some melanotic stool. He also developed renal failure and by
this stage , his creatinine increased to 2.9. By postoperative
day #9 , his Nimbex and fentanyl infusions were stopped. His PA
mean pressure had reduced to less than 30. He became febrile
fevers and developed some purulent discharge from the VAD driveline.
On postoperative day #12 , he underwent fluoroscopic placement of
a post-pyloric feeding tube and continued to spike temperatures.
His bilirubin continued to rise , and his ammonia level had also
risen. On postoperative day #14 , he continued to be unstable
with deteriorating liver function , ongoing renal failure ,
metabolic acidosis , ongoing fevers , hemodynamically instability
and episodes of ventricular tachycardia. He also had by this
stage developed irreversible loss of fingers and toes. Due to
his unrelenting and deteriorating multisystem organ failure , a
family meeting was held at which the poor prognosis was
discussed. The family elected to withdraw all support and on
5/23/06 , the AICD was switched off as was the ventilator and the
ventricular assist device and comfort measures were instituted.
Mr. Desilvo died at 7:30 p.m. on 5/23/06 from multiple organ
failure secondary to complications of ischemic cardiomyopathy and
placement of ventricular assist device.

dyspnea. At baseline can walk 4-5 blocks , over last couple weeks can
only walk about 1 block before becoming SOB. Was also getting SOB w/
minimal activity at home including showering. Sleeps on one pillow , no
orthopnea , no PND. Has had some pedal edema over the few weeks.
Increased urination and increased thirst , no reported change in diet.
Recently stopped HCTZ but no other change in meds. Also w/ some dull
chest pain over left side that radiates in a band like fashion across his
stenum to back , 3-4/10 in intensity , not brought on by activity , lasts
for seconds at a time when present , pleuritic. Reproducible w/
palpation. Pt had fallen on his right side several weeks earlier. Some
dull abdominal discomfort in lower quadrants usually improved with bowel
movements , last BM yesterday. No n/v. No calf tenderness , no recent
surgery , no recent travel. March wt 158lbs by records , pt has not
noticed any weight gain.
Pt reports not having this pain previously , however by records pt was
evaluated in 3/2/05 for similar atypical chest pains that was
ultimately a neg workup , with ECHO 4/9 w/ diastolic dysfn EF 60-65% , no
WMA , mod MR , mod TR , stress test 8/13 w/ no changes c/w ischemia on EKG
or ECHO ( but non-diagnositic due to peak HR 64 BP 140/66 ). He was seen
by Dr Decuir at that time who felt that ACS/ischemia was unlikely , and
that symptoms may have been 2/2 CHF and MR ( and his ECHO also showed new
AI at that time ) , and pt was apparently started on ACE at that time for
afterload reduction. He is not on an ACE right now and it is unclear
why. Further w/u of ischemia was suggested if the pt had persistent
symptoms but the symptoms seemed to have resolved by these notes.
In ED 97.8 55 176/64 18 98%RA. BNP 1196 , trop-I 0.10. d-dimer 272. Got
ASA . EKG sinus brady no ST/TW changes. D-dimer 272. CXR no obvious

hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia who
presented to the Emergency Department on 4/18/02 with
substernal chest pressure , and ST depressions in V4 and V6 after
undergoing a stress test. He was in his usual state of health
until 1 month prior to admission when he started noticing a
burning in his chest while walking to work. This progressed to a
point where the pain was present with minimal exertion such as
moving a chair. The burning was relieved by rest. He saw his
primary care physician two days prior to admission who started
him on Atenolol and Nitroglycerin spray. The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization on 3/28/06 , which revealed right
coronary artery with a mid 90% stenosis and an ostial 60%
stenosis , a ramus coronary artery with a proximal 90% stenosis ,
left anterior descending coronary artery with a proximal 70%
stenosis , left circumflex coronary artery with a mid 50%
stenosis , first diagonal coronary artery with a proximal 50%
stenosis and a right dominant circulation. Echocardiogram
performed on 3/25/06 revealed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild
mitral insufficiency , and mild tricuspid insufficiency.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Quesenberry was brought to the operating room on 7/12/06 where
he underwent an elective coronary artery bypass graft x5 with a
sequential graft right radial artery from the aorta to the right
coronary artery and then the first obtuse marginal coronary
artery and left internal mammary artery from the first diagonal
coronary artery and then the left anterior descending coronary
artery and a right radial graft to this left circumflex coronary
artery. Total bypass time was 200 minutes and total crossclamp

c/b allograft CAD , DM , HTN. He has been doing well in his USOH until he
developed nausea and vomiting 2 days prior to admission. No unusual
foods , no sick contacts. He had some ""discomfort"" in his stomach on
Monday that seemed to get better briefly before he developed diarrhea and
vomiting. The following day he felt weak , didn't get out of bed and had
watery non-bloody diarrhea with ~ 10 BMs throughout the day , and NBNB
emesis. On AM of admission he still felt poorly and came to the ED. Poor
po intake. He has had no orthopnea , PND , lower extremity edema and denies
palpitations , lightheadedness , or syncope. His review of systems is
negative in detail with no recent history of fever , chills , nausea , or
neurologic symptoms.
In the ED he received a bolus on NS 500cc and has felt better without any
N/V/D and feels like ""he could lift a cow"". He had cardiac enzymes sent
which revealed a TnI of 0.06 and 2nd set 0.09. He is admitted to trend
his cardiac enzymes and for Dobutamine stress test in the morning.

Discharge Date: 1/29/2007
ATTENDING: LARR , ELVIS TED MD
PRINCIPAL ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Severe aortic stenosis and
congestive heart failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , Ms. Quist is an
81-year-old female with a known history of severe aortic stenosis
and multiple medical comorbidities who had been transferred from
an outside hospital to the Coronary Care Unit for
congestive heart failure likely related to overwhelming aortic
disease. She had previously declined aortic valve replacement in
the year prior to her admission. She had an echo performed at
outside hospital just prior to admission to Lumca Hospital showed an EF of 55-60% with severe aortic stenosis , an
aortic valve area of 0.6 cm square as well as 1+ mitral regurg
and 1-2+ tricuspid regurg. She was admitted to the medical
service at MH where she was aggressively diuresed. She was also
prepared for urgent aortic valve replacement and possible
coronary artery bypass grafting. At the time of her admission ,
her past medical history included hypertension , peripheral
vascular disease , history of stroke with left upper extremity
sensory loss , diabetes type 2 , hypothyroidism ,
hypercholesterolemia , renal failure with bilateral renal artery
stenosis , parkinsonianism , iron-deficiency anemia , vitamin B12
deficiency , obstructive sleep apnea , seizure disorder and colon
cancer status post resection in 1987. She is unable to elaborate
on the details of that resection. She also had renal artery
stenting in 2005.
ALLERGIES: Stated allergies at the time of admission included
Lipitor for which she had myalgias and an erythromycin with a
reaction of which was unknown.
MEDICATIONS: Her admission medications include labetolol 150
p.o. daily , amlodipine 5 mg p.o. daily , Isordil 30 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , Coumadin 5
p.o. daily , Lasix 60 mg twice a day , Colace 100 mg twice a day ,
iron sulfate 325 once a day , folic acid 1 mg p.o. once day ,
hydralazine 25 mg daily and Synthroid 88 mcg daily as well as
Dilantin 300 mg p.o. twice a day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , her physical
exam showed a woman 5 feet 1 inches tall , weighing 94 kilos in
obvious mild respiratory distress. Her temperature was 97 and heart
rate was 83 and sinus. Her blood pressure in the right arm was
120/63 , in the left arm was 109/53. She was on 5L of nasal
cannula while satting 99%. The remainder of her physical exam was
notable only for a loud holosystolic murmur at the right upper
sternal border and radiation to her both carotid arteries. Her
Allen's test showed severely dampened waveform in both left and
right radial arteries. Her chest sounded congested with rales
present bilaterally and her extremities showed 1-2+ bilateral
lower extremity edema. Her carotid , radial and femoral arteries
were all 2+ , but her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial were
present only by Doppler bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: Notable lab data at the time of admission
included a BUN and creatinine of 79 and 3.1 respectively and a
beta natriuretic peptide of 39 , 085. Cardiac catheterization performed on
9/10/06 showed 60% lesion of the ostial LAD as well as an 80% proximal LAD
lesion. She also had 90% ostial D1 and a 40% ostial OM1 lesion and right
dominant circulation. Her echo on 5/26/06 showed an ejection fraction of
60% , severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 60 mmHg and a
peak gradient of 99 mmHg. Again her calculated valve area is 0.6
cm square. Her chest x-ray on 5/26/06 was consistent with
congestive heart failure and appeared very fluid overloaded. She
was taken on 9/10/06 to the operating room where aortic valve
replacement with aortic root patch was performed , 21 Biocor
porcine graft was inserted. She also had a two-vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting using vein to her left anterior descending
and vein grafting to her D1 vessel. She tolerated the procedure
relatively well , but her ensuing ICU course was protracted and
very complicated and will be summarized systematically.
Neurologically , the patient suffered no acute complications
postoperatively; however , her state of consciousness waxed and
waned with her overall condition.
From a cardiovascular standpoint , the patient suffered a perioperative MI in
the late hours of 9/10/06 and on to the early hours of 5/17/06 .  She also
went into atrial fibrillation on postoperative day two and
suffered rhythm abnormalities for the remainder of her
postoperative course. Multiple conversion attempts were made
both pharmaceutically as well as with electrocardioversion , but
she occasionally did covert to normal sinus rhythm. Ultimately ,
she reverted back into atrial fibrillation. The third
postoperative day , she became hypotensive and asystolic. Chest
compressions were initiated for less than one minute at which
time atrial pacing was initiated and her rhythm was regained with
adequate blood pressure , though she was returned on to several
days of active drips to support her blood pressure. From this
point , Ms. Pavick developed dependence on pressors and inotropic
agents to support her blood pressure and cardiovascular system.
After several months with no real recovery of her cardiovascular
status , the family decided to withdraw care and put her on
comfort measures only. She ultimately suffered a cardiac arrest
on 1/16/07 .
From a pulmonary perspective , while she was extubated on the morning of
postoperative day #2 , she was ultimately reintubated and several pulmonary
complications required multiple bronchoscopies , multiple thoracentesis on both
chest for recurrent effusions and several chest tubes had to be placed for
aforementioned effusions. She was ultimately trached by the third
week and although she did occasionally come off the ventilator at
times , she never displayed adequate pulmonary function to be free
from vent dependence for any length of time.
From a GI perspective , with her trach , she underwent a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube for enteral feeds and at times needed to be
placed on total parenteral nutrition as she only occassionally tolerated
tube feeds. She did develop a Clostridium difficile infection
and had to be placed on long-term TPN until resolution of that
infection.
Her renal status at baseline was poor , though she was not on dialysis.
Postoperatively , she never recovered any meaningful renal function of her own.
She was placed on continuous venovenous hemodialysis by the third
week ultimately became anuric , requiring triweekly hemodialysis on Monday ,
Wednesday and Friday , a schedule she was managed on until the time of her
death.
From an ID standpoint , she developed many bacteremias and GI
infections as previously discussed. The Infectious Disease Team
was involved in her care and there recommendations were followed
throughout her hospitalization. For the greater duration of her
ICU course , she was maintained on vancomycin , levofloxacin and
Flagyl on and off for multiple infections.
From an endocrine standpoint , she was maintained on her Synthroid dosing and
was on a CZI drip for blood sugar control throughout her ICU course.
Hematologically , the patient was transfused many many blood
products over the course of her ICU stay. She also developed
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and subsequent clots to her left
lower extremity requiring vascular surgery intervention. She had
embolectomy and thrombectomy of her left common femoral artery as
well as a left common femoral endarterectomy with patch
angioplasty on 3/13/06 .  She was maintained on bivalirudin and
Coumadin throughout her ICU course.
Given her preoperative status and multiple medical comorbidities as well as her
overall poor prognosis through many postsurgical complications , a family
meeting on 10/12/07 resulted in decision to withdraw support and provide
comfort measures only. At that time , tube feeds were stopped , hemodialysis was
stopped
and the patient was made comfortable with morphine until her
ultimate cardiac arrest at 0235 am on 1/16/07 .

ATTENDING: SPILIAKOS , JODY DOMENIC MD
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Acute renal failure.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Acute on chronic renal failure.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Deglopper is a 63-year-old
male , stage III CHF and extensive past medical history notable
for hypertension , insulin-dependent diabetes and an MI , status
post CABG in 1989 and an unsuccessful catheterization in October
2005 , who presented following three days of oliguria. The
patient stated that for the last seven weeks , he has been
travelling on vocation , while he was awake , he noted decreased
dosages of many of his medicines specifically , he reduced his own
Lasix dose from 480 mg daily to 180 mg b.i.d. He also reduced
his Lotrel by half from 10 mg/40 mg to 5 mg/20 mg. He is also
taking Humalog 10 units , Lantus 45 units and Humulin 5 units. He
stated that his glucose levels were well controlled with blood
sugars less than 140. The patient reports that while he was
away , he felt as good as he has ever felt , was able to walk
greater than longer distances and over all felt much stronger.
However , he states that on Thursday night , he noticed that
instead of urinating as normal of 4-5 times per night , he was
found to only urinate 2-3 times. He did not urinate at all on
subsequent days and then put out merely a point of urine on the
day prior to admission. He reported that his urinary stream was
not the usual strength. He did not report dysuria or sensation
of being incomplete voiding. In addition , he noted that his
weight usually fluctuated approximately 4-6 pounds per day , but
that he had gained approximately 12 pounds since his oliguria
presented. He notes that his legs are swollen more than usual
and he denies chest pain , palpitations , or shortness or breath.
MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's medical history is notable for
CAD , status post CABG , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , CHF ,
obstructive sleep apnea , insulin-dependent diabetes and a hiatal
hernia.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission , his vital signs were
stable with a temperature of 95.8 , heart rate of 60 , blood
pressure 90/50 and saturating 99% on room air. The patient was
an obese male. He was normocephalic and atraumatic with equal ,
round and reactive pupils. His hearing and vision were grossly
intact. His neck exam was significant for JVD of 8 cm. He had
no carotid bruits. His pulmonary exam was clear to auscultation
bilaterally. He had a normal PMI. No right ventricular heave.
His rate and rhythm were normal. He had a normal S1 and S2.
Midsystolic and holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex 3 out
of 6. His abdomen was notable for multiple abdominal scars and a
large abdominal hernia. He had positive bowel sounds. His
abdomen was soft and nontender. His extremities were significant
for 1-2+ pitting edema to ankles. There was no erythema , warmth ,
or calf tenderness. His neurologic exam was nonfocal.
His significant labs on admission was hyponatremia , sodium of 130
and potassium of 2.9. A creatinine of 3.0 , BUN of 99 and a
glucose of 80. His white cells were 9.7. His hematocrit was
36.0. His platelet count was 212 , 000. His UA was negative. His
renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis. No obstruction and a
left renal cyst. His chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly. No
effusions or no evidence of pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Renal. The patient's presentation consistent with acute on
chronic renal failure , which was attributed to low-effective
arterial blood volume and extensive cardiac history notable for
diastolic heart failure in addition to hypertension ,
atherosclerosis , most likely contributed to his chronic kidney
disease with a baseline creatinine in October 2005 of 1.6. He
was initially aggressively treated with diuresis with IV
furosemide on admission. His ACE inhibitor was held due to
increased renal perfusion. His urine output increased over his
initial two days of admission and his weight decreased from 261
pounds upon admission to 254 pounds , three days later. His
baseline weight prior to this episode of oliguria was 249 pounds.
His diurese were held per recommendations of the renal consult
team in order to allow for further decrease in his creatinine
before he was given them again. He continued diurese and began
his ACE inhibitor therapy prior to discharge.
Cardiovascular: During his hospital stay , Mr. Sperandio
experienced multiple episodes of his typical anginal symptoms as
well as a more pronounced episode of 10 out of 10 chest pain on
hospital day #3. During each event , the patient was noted to
have no significant EKG changes and his cardiac enzymes were
always negative. He underwent an echocardiographic exam during
this admission , which was essentially unchanged from his previous
echo on October of 2005. His ejection fraction had increased in
fact to 75%. There was minimal left ventricular hypertrophy. He
was continued on his regimen of isosorbide mononitrate 240 mg
p.o. q.a.m. , which actually was changed from 240 mg q.a.m. to 120
mg b.i.d. for more continuous coverage. He also received his
home regimen of aspirin , statins , Plavix and was started on
heparin for prophylaxis. In addition , his magnesium and
potassium were repleted as necessary. The patient continued his
home regimen of Lantus , Humalog and Regular Insulin by
fingersticks and then self-administering what he needed to
coverage levels. He continued his Synthroid for hypothyroidism
and his TSH was within normal limits during this admission. The
patient's discharge medications included aspirin 325 mg p.o.
daily , allopurinol 100 mg p.o. daily , Regular Insulin sliding
scale , which he self-administers , levothyroxine , sodium 50 mcg
p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 100 mg b.i.d. , Humalog sliding scale , which
he administers to himself daily , Plavix 75 mg , p.o. daily , Lantus
45 units subcu q.p.m. , Lasix 160 mg p.o. daily , nitroglycerine
sublinguals p.r.n. for chest pain and Lotrel 5/20 mg p.o. daily ,
Imdur 240 mg p.o. daily and Lipitor 40 mg p.o. daily. The
patient was discharged to home with followup appointment with Dr.
Stoss in 1-2 weeks.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.

SUMMARY: This is a 42-year-old morbidly obese female with a
history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
complicated by BKA on two prior occasions , who was admitted to the
MICU with a BKA in the setting of urosepsis and a non-Q-wave MI.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Her hospital course by systems is as follows:
1. ENDOCRINE: As noted above , the patient
presented with BKA in the setting of urosepsis and a non-Q-wave MI.
She was placed on an insulin drip and hydrated with intravenous
fluids , with improvement. She was eventually transitioned to NPH
with insulin sliding scale coverage. Despite escalating her dose
of NPH up to 65 U subcu b.i.d. on the day of discharge , she
continued to have elevated blood sugars >200 and required coverage
with insulin sliding scale. This issue will need to be addressed
as an outpatient.
2. PULMONARY: Posthydration , the patient was noted to have
increasing respiratory rates and O2 requirements and rales on exam.
As her creatinine had improved concurrent with hydration , she was
gently diuresed. An echocardiogram was obtained to assess her left
ventricular function in the context of her non-Q-wave MI , which was
notable for normal left ventricular function , with an EF of 50% ,
hypokinesis of the inferior septum , a right ventricle that was
mildly enlarged , with mildly decreased systolic function , normal
aortic valve , mild TR , and mild MR , and a pulmonary artery pressure
of 39 mm of mercury plus right atrial pressure consistent with
pulmonary hypertension and no pericardial effusion. With her body
habitus putting her at risk for DVT and PE , an echocardiogram which
showed evidence of pulmonary hypertension raised the concern for PE
being responsible for her symptoms of tachypnea and tachycardia. A
spiral CT was obtained that was nondiagnostic secondary to her body
habitus. A VQ scan was obtained , which was read as low probability
for PE. In addition , she also had negative LENIs. These studies
taken together alleviated the concern of PE or DVT in her. It was
felt that the patient likely had obstructive sleep apnea secondary
to her body habitus. She was maintained on CPAP during her
hospitalization stay; however , the patient informed the treating
team that she would not be using a CPAP machine once she returned
home secondary to the inconvenience and discomfort.
3. ID: On admission to MICU , given her positive urinalysis , she
was placed on cefotaxime for gram negative coverage. Both her
blood cultures and urine cultures grew out E. coli which were
sensitive to cefotaxime and gentamycin. As she initially continued
to be febrile and continued to have positive blood cultures , one
dose of gentamycin was given for synergy. Subsequently , she
improved. She remains on IV cefotaxime for the 7-day period that
she was in the MICU. On transfer to the floor , she was switched to
p.o. levofloxacin and will take 7 days of p.o. levofloxacin to
complete a total 14-day course of antibiotics for urosepsis.
4. CARDIOVASCULAR: Patient ruled in for a non-Q-wave MI by EKG
and enzymes. Her peak CK was 1200 , with a troponin of 1.52. She
was initially placed on aspirin , heparin , and a beta blocker. Once
her creatinine normalized , an ACE inhibitor was also added.
Heparin was discontinued once the concern for PE was alleviated.
Her beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were titrated up for a goal
systolic blood pressure of <140 and a pulse of <70. She was
transferred to the floor on hospital day 7 , where she remained
stable. Another guanosine MIBI was obtained , as the patient
reported that she would be unable to exercise , given her chronic
low back pain and sciatica. A planar study was done secondary to
her body habitus , which revealed a moderate sized area of prior
myocardial infarction throughout the mid LAD coronary territory ,
with moderate residual peri-infarct ischemia. The Cardiology
Service did not feel that the degree of this lesion warranted
catheterization , given the sizable risk of catheterization in her.
5. RENAL: On presentation , the patient had a creatinine of 2.1 ,
up from her baseline of 1.4. She was felt to have acute renal
failure , secondary dehydration , in the setting of diabetic
ketoacidosis. She was rehydrated and concurrent with this her
creatinine returned to her baseline and remained stable thereafter.
6. GI: On admission to the MICU , the patient was placed on GI
prophylaxis with Carafate. Once she was tolerating p.o.'s , she was
placed on an ADA diet and her Carafate was discontinued prior to
discharge. Once transferred to the floor , the patient complained
of diarrhea; however , the nurses did not witness and were unable to
obtain a stool sample to check for C. diff toxin. Patient was
treated symptomatically with Imodium p.r.n. diarrhea. Prior to
discharge , the patient was counseled by the Nutrition Service
regarding an appropriate diabetic and coronary artery disease diet.
7. PAIN: On admission , the patient was on several pain medicines ,
including amitriptyline , Flexeril , and Valium for reported history
of sciatica and low back pain. On this hospitalization , these
medications were discontinued and she was placed on Neurontin for
likely diabetic neuropathy.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
NPH Humulin insulin 65 U subcu b.i.d. ,
human insulin sliding scale: for blood sugars 151-200 give 4 U ,
for blood sugars 201-250 give 6 U , for blood sugars 251-300 give 8
U , for blood sugars 301-350 give 10 U , Imodium 2 mg p.o. q. 6 hrs.
p.r.n. diarrhea , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150
one tab sublingual q. 5 min. x 3 p.r.n. chest pain , multivitamin
one tab p.o. q.d. , simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Neurontin 600 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. x 5 days , Toprol XL 400
mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISPOSITION: Prior to discharge , the patient was evaluated by the
physical therapist , who noted her to walk around the
hospital Eldsche St , Lake Corp Ver , Alaska 29176 without significant problems. They felt that she
would be safe to discharge to home and did not need home PT , but
agreed that she would benefit from cardiac rehab , for which she was
referred. Patient was discharged to home on hospital day 9 , with
VNA , who will monitor her blood pressure , pulse , and blood sugar ,
and contact her PCP with any concerns or questions. She will
follow up with her PCP , Dr. Carmine Guillebeau , at WNDH in one week's
time , and she will follow up with Dr. Sammie Derobertis of cardiology
at Gons Landgilesnyton Dralvail in April .

ATTENDING: BRADLEY FRIEDRICHSEN M.D.
DIAGNOSIS: Left calcaneus osteomyelitis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Kubly is a 61-year-old
gentleman with type II diabetes , coronary artery disease ,
peripheral neuropathy and hypertension who presents for
evaluation of a longstanding left heel ulcer and presumed
calcaneus osteomyelitis. He also has had multiple surgeries in
the past as well as hyperbaric oxygen and has been refractory to
these treatments. He has had a recent flare in 3/16 and has
been treated at Eltham Medical Center .  At that time the wound grew
out methicillin resistant staph aureus and e. coli. These
organisms have been treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn. However ,
an MRI at that time was thought to be consistent with
osteomyelitis. The patient presented for treatment of this
issue.
Additionally , the patient has had some left shoulder pain and was
admitted at Otjo Goldtion Hospital on 1/26/2003 . There was concern for
sepsis at the sternoclavicular joint or perhaps at the
glenohumeral joint. The patient had an MRI at the outside
hospital which is not available to us but was concerning for some
abnormal process at the sternoclavicular joint. The patient
states he still has some shoulder pain that localizes to the
sternoclavicular joint. This seems to be improving over time.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left heel ulcer and calcaneal
osteomyelitis , BPH status post TURP in 1984 , insulin diabetes
mellitus , hypertension , coronary artery disease status post an MI
in 1991 , cataracts.
ALLERGIES: To codeine.
MEDICATIONS: The patient takes insulin NPH 40 q.a.m. and 30
q.p.m. , Humalog 20 in the morning 60 at night , Norvasc 5 once a
day , Allopril ( sp? ) 40 once a day , Prilosec 20 once a day , K-Dur
10 once a day , Lasix 40 once a day , enteric coated aspirin 80
once a day , Protonix 40 once a day , Reglan 5 twice a day , Xanax
0.25 q.h.s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs on admission are
stable with a temperature of 98.4. A pleasant gentleman. Clear
lungs. Heart regular rhythm. Abdomen soft and nontender. Left
heel has a 1.5 cm ulcer on the posterior aspect that appears to
tract deep to bone. He has generalized decreased neuropathy in
the foot and minimal EHL or FHL. He has 5/5 _____ with limited
range of motion at the ankle.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION: White count of 6 , hematocrit of
30 , sed rate of 111.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital for
evaluation and treatment of his calcaneous osteomyelitis. An MRI
was obtained which was read with a bone radiologist and
consistent with osteomyelitis. The patient was taken for
debridement to the operating room , after preoperative clearance
by the medicine team , for debridement of calcaneal osteomyelitis
on 7/6/2003 ( see _____ of the procedure ). Postoperatively the
patient was continued on Vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl per
the infectious disease recommendations. The cultures from the
primary debridement ( in which the wound was able to be closed )
was methicillin resistant staph aureus.
The patient did well inhouse. His wound to the foot was changed
while inhouse and looked intact , clean and dry without drainage.
The drain was removed on postoperative day #4.
Regarding the patient's left sternoclavicular joint , CT scan was
obtained which was concerning for infection at the
sternoclavicular joint. An MRI was obtained to better image the
area and to determine whether or not there is some involvement of
the clavicle. On the CT scan there was no obvious collection
amenable to surgical decompression. At the time of this
dictation the MRI was pending.
The patient had also had a preoperative consult with the Plastic
Surgery team but this was not necessary at the patient's wound
was able to be closed in the OR. Additionally , vascular studies
were obtained which were read as excellent PVRs preoperatively.
FOLLOW UP: The patient will follow up with the Infectious
Disease team as well as primary care physician as well as
Orthopedic Surgery team and Dr. Talburt one week after discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Per the ID record , Vancomycin 1 gram
q.24h as well as gatifloxacin 200 mg once a day. The patient
will continue his home medicines.
LABS: Labs will be checked once per week by the primary care
physician.
WEIGHTBEARING: The patient will be tested on weightbearing of
the left lower extremity.

1 )C/V
+I- Pt was R/OMI'ed with all three sets negative for ischemia. This was
to examine for causes of CHF exacerbation. Pt was continued on her home
rx of betablocker , asa , statin
+P- Pt normotensive. Likely fluid
overloaded given CXR , physical exam , and HPI. Pt was diuresed with IV
Lasix in the ED. On the floor she received 2.5mg of Metolazone followed
by 60mg of Torsemide. She was then diuresed with 5mg of Metolazone
followed by 120mg of Torsemide. She was roughly negative 1.3L. Pt was
doing clinically well when on 4/23 pt's Cr increased to 3.2 from her
baseline of about 2.5. At that time Torsemide and Metolazone were held.
Pt's daily weights continued to decrease even off of diuretics. On 3/4 ,
however pt's weight increased to 72.9 kg from 70.6kg. At this time pt was
restarted on her home rx of torsemide 20mg po bid. A repeat weight was
checked in the pm returning as 71.7kg. Pt was discharged on 3/4 at a
weight of 158 lbs.
of discharge pt was at or better than her baseline function in terms of
her orthopnea/SOB.
+R- During her stay the patient remained in afib with good rate control
on her bblocker.
2 ) Heme: Pt was found to be supertheraputic during her stay. Her coumadin
was held throughout her admission as her INR remained 3.9 to 4.0 in the
setting of hemoptysis. On
discharge pt was started on 1/2 her home coumadin with VNA/PCP f/u in 2
days. Pt d/ced on Coumadin 1mg qpm.
3 ) ID- Pt had a negative UA and urine CTX. However during her admission pt
developed diarrhea. Because of concern for c.diff colitis. Pt recieved an
abdominal CT. CT showed no colitis but did show a LLL consolidation likely
PNA. Pt was initially treated with azithromycin but as her cough and o2
requirement did not improve , as well as because pt began to spike fevers ,
pt was begun on ceftaz and levo for gram pos coverage ( levo ) double gram
neg coverage , and atypical coverage ( levo ) for presumed hospital aquired
PNA in the setting of pt's multiple hosp for CHF exacerbation this year.
PT improved clinically and was d/ced on levofloxacin 500mg q48h x 7 days
and ceftaz changed to cefpodoxime 200mg po qd x 7 days.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: ZOGG , RAYMOND RANDALL MD
DISCHARGE DATE:
Presumed to be 10/9/05 .
PRIMARY ONCOLOGIST:
Antoine Petchulis , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Pain secondary to a lytic lesion in the right hip.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
Recurrent lymphoma , pulmonary dysfunction secondary to
chemotherapy and obesity.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
In brief , this is a 57-year-old female with follicular lymphoma
diagnosed approximately eight years ago who has been treated in
the past with CVP and CHOP/Rituxan. She underwent high-dose
chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue in 6/22 .  Her
transplant was complicated by worsening of her baseline impaired
lung function , and she has been oxygen dependent since the time
of transplant. In 4/9 , she began to have back pain and
eventually was shown to have recurrent or increasing disease in
the retroperitoneum by abdominal CT ( paraaortic at the level of
L2 ). The decision was made to pursue radiation therapy to this
area , which she completed on 10/4/05 . The patient presented
with complaints of pain in the mid lower back radiating in a
band-like distribution around the waist to the abdomen as well as
into the right hip and buttock area. The pain also radiated into
the right thigh with movement for weightbearing. The patient
reports the pain was occasionally associated with numbness in the
right lateral thigh. She denied any radiation of the pain to
below the knee. She denied any numbness in the lower legs , back
or saddle area. She denied any change in bowel or bladder
function.
The patient had fluoroscopic LP on 6/18/05 with a glucose of 69 ,
a total protein of 49.3 , and cytology which was negative. Plain
films of her hip showed enthesopathy of the superior pelvis
bilaterally , lower lumbar spine degeneration , and sclerotic focus
in the proximal region of the right femur. MRI of the lumbar
spine on 8/5/05 showed an irregular soft tissue mass within the
retroperitoneum centered anterior to the spine at the level of
L2 , position posterior to the IVC and right lateral aorta
measuring 4.5 x 2.7 x 3.4 cm; there is a lesion involving the
anterior superior aspect to the L2 vertebral body continuous with
the anterior paraspinal mass with wedging and probable pathologic
compression fracture. No epidural mass.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Recurrent lymphoma.
2. Pulmonary function thought to be due in part to BCNU
chemotherapy , currently on 5 liters home O2.
3. Status post cholecystectomy.
4. Obesity.

children.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:
Vitals: Temperature 97.6 , heart rate 91 , blood pressure 140/90 ,
respiratory rate 22 , oxygen saturation 97% on 5 liters. In
general , the patient was found to be alert and oriented x3 with
difficulty standing secondary to pain and habitus. HEENT:
Pupils were equally round and reactive to light. Normal sclerae ,
normal conjunctivae. Extraocular movements were intact. Moist
mucous membranes and clear oropharynx. Neck: No
lymphadenopathy , no thyromegaly. Pulmonary: Clear to
auscultation bilaterally with some wheeze at the right base.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no
murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Morbid obesity , nontender ,
normoactive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly. Back: Mild
paraspinal tenderness bilaterally. Extremities: Bilateral lower
extremity edema. Neuro: 2/5 hip flexion and knee extension and
flexion on the right; 5/5 hip flexion and knee extension and
flexion on the right; 5/5 hip flexion and knee extension and
flexion on the left; distal neuropathy.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
At the time of admission , white cell count 9.8 , hematocrit 35.5 ,
platelets 249. INR 2.1 , PTT 45.8. BMP showed a sodium of 139 ,
potassium 4.2 , chloride 99 , bicarbonate 36 , BUN 19 , creatinine
0.6 , glucose 126. LFTs were within normal limits. UA showed 2+
bacteria but no white cells.
In general , this is a 57-year-old female with follicular lymphoma
who presented for workup of lower back pain recurring status post
XRT to the lumbar spine region.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Oncology: CT of the thoracic , lumbar , and sacral spine on
8/18/05 showed no evidence of cord compression but did show a
compression fracture at L2. IR was consulted on 4/18/05
regarding the possibility of kyphoplasty to this area; however ,
they deferred further treatment , as the pain was thought to be
secondary to hip pathology rather than lumbar spine pathology.
CT of the right hip on 4/18/05 showed a lytic lesion in the
posterior acetabulum with an associated fracture. The patient
was evaluated by Orthopedic Oncology as well as Radiation
Oncology. Dr. Cestia with Orthopedic Oncology deferred any
surgical intervention until the completion of radiation therapy.
The patient started radiation therapy to the right hip on
3/29/05 . The contact in Radiation Oncology is Britt L Redden , M.D. , pager number 28468. The plan is for the
patient to complete a course of 18 treatments of radiation to the
right hip. The patient will then have a repeat CT of the right
hip in one month's time and follow up with Dr. Saralegui . She has an
appointment to meet with Dr. Strief on 9/8/05 at 2:45 p.m. Per
recommendations of Orthopedic Oncology and Physical Therapy , the
patient is to be touched down weightbearing on the right leg
( toes only ) and full weightbearing on the left leg. It is
expected that she should be able to undergo physical therapy with
the use of a walker. She should be kept on posterior hip
precaution with limitation of hip flexion and internal rotation
of the right hip.
2. Pain: The patient was seen by the Pain Service during this
hospitalization. Her current pain regimen includes methadone 5
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and 100 mg p.o.
q.8. a.m. and q. noon , MSIR 30 mg p.o. q.h.s. as well as 15-30 mg
q.2h. as needed. The patient was also started on Decadron 10 mg
p.o. q.a.m. given her initial concern for spinal cord
compression. She has been tapering off of the Decadron and will
be discharged on 4 mg p.o. q.a.m. with taper as listed in the
discharge instructions. Once the patient has completed Decadron
2 mg p.o. q.a.m. x3 doses , she should then be started on
prednisone 10 mg p.o. daily per her home dosing for pulmonary
disease. The patient did receive pamidronate 90 mg IV x1 during
this hospitalization.
3. ID: UA on admission was more or less benign , and urine
culture remained negative. The patient was afebrile throughout
her hospitalization. She was given a five-day course of
acyclovir 200 mg p.o. five times per day for concern of recurrent
genital herpes. Given continued complaints of vaginal itching ,
the patient was given fluconazole 150 mg x1 on 10/17/05 to treat
a presumed yeast infection.
4. GI: The patient has a history of constipation secondary to
use of pain medication. She has been having good bowel movement
on MiraLax , Senna , Colace. She has also writing for Dulcolax
p.r.n. for constipation.
5. Heme: The patient is on Coumadin given a recent history of
DVT. She had an INR of 3.7 two days prior to admission , so her
dosing was reduced during this hospitalization. Her INR has been
stable and is at 2.3 at the time of discharge on dosing of 4.5 mg
p.o. q.h.s.
6. Pulmonary: As mentioned above , the patient has a pulmonary
dysfunction with a home O2 requirement of 5 liters. She has been
stable on this home O2 requirement throughout this
hospitalization. She does require CPAP at night for obstructive
sleep apnea.
7. Cardiovascular: No known history of cardiovascular disease.
Echo on 1/28/04 showed an EF of 55%.
8. Endo: The patient is on a sliding scale of regular insulin
while on Decadron. It is intended that this should be stopped
when the Decadron taper has finished.
9. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: The patient had some
hypocalcemia during this hospitalization. She was started on
Tums 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. , with good response. She was also given
pamidronate x1 as listed above.

DISPOSITION:
The patient is being discharged to the Ensers 1 for further
rehabilitation. She has a lytic lesion in the right hip with
evidence of fracture. Per recommendations of Orthopedic Oncology
as well as physical therapy , please limit right leg to touchdown
weightbearing only. The patient should be full weightbearing on
the left leg with physical therapy involving use of a walker.
The patient was stable at the time of discharge. She should
continue with her radiation therapy to completion and then follow
up with Dr. Kelvin Lang , in Orthopedic Oncology on 9/8/05 .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: hypotension at home
*****************
HPI: 67M w/recent FH admit for fluid overload in the setting of chronic
kidney disease and dietary salt load. He was sent home on higher doses
of his BP meds as well as the addition of HCTZ to his home lasix dose.
He was also sent home on a 10 day course of cipro for a foley-associated
UTI. He did well until the day of admission when he felt tired , checked
his BP himself at home and found it was 86/41 , so he called his doctor
who directed him the the ER. He denies SOB , COP , orthopnea , PND , N/V ,
abdominal pain , or cough. He has had loose stools x 3 days which he
believes is because the VNA increased his stool softeners. In the ED his
BP was 91/60 with a pulse of 60 and he got 1L fluid.

IMPRESSION: 68M with fluid-reponsive hypotension in setting of recent
aggressive diuresis and blood pressure medicine augmentation.
1 ) CV( p ): Mr. Axtell was felt to be hypotensive from being dry in the
setting of overdiuresis and increased stool output. His BP was fluid
responsive to 1L in the ED , after which he was able to maintain oral
hydration. His diuretics were held during his hospital stay and his
lasix will need to be resumed once he begins to put on water weight ( he
may not need the HCTZ , as the synergy of the two diuretics appears to
have been too much for him ). His ARB was held in the setting of his
acute on chronic renal failure and will also need to be resumed once his
creatinine improves to his baseline. His labetalol dose was also reduced
to allow him to mount a heart rate response to hypotension. His
nifedipine dose stayed the same. He was tolerating a regimen of
labetalol 100mg PO twice a day and nifedipine 120mg PO once a day on
discharge , with systolic blood pressures in the 120-130s.
2 ) RENAL: as noted above , the patient appeared to be in acute on
chronic renal failure from overdiuresis. He continued to make good
urine output ( 1-2L per day ) and his creatinine trended downward. His
ARB was held but will need to be restarted as an outpatient.
3 ) DM: he was maintained on his home regimen of lantus 48 , aspartate qac
and slide scale. He was on a renal , cardiac , diabetic diet.
FULL CODE
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1 ) Mr. Deasy : your lasix , hydrocholorthiazide , and irbesartan were
stopped. Your doctor will tell you when to restart the irbesartan
( avapro ). Please weigh yourself daily and restart your lasix 80mg once a
day if you gain more than 2 pounds.
2 ) Mr. Pocasangre : your labetalol is now 100mg twice a day ( was 200mg twice a
day ).
3 ) VNA: please check Mr. Outhouse blood pressure , heart rate , and weight
twice a week and call or fax results to PCP.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1 ) Please note the following medicines were stopped in the setting of
medicine related hypotension: lasix and hydrochlorothiazide. Please
resume as needed.
2 ) Please note the following medicine was held in the setting of acute
renal failure from dehydration: irbesartan. Please resume when
creatinine has returned to patient's baseline.

GI
BRIEF ADMISSION HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Chirico is a 50-year-old male with a history of Hep-C and NASH
cirrhosis who was transferred from the outside hospital with
presumed hepatic encephalopathy after being found unresponsive in
his apartment. Of note , the patient has been in the ED two days
prior to admission on 3/17/2007 for abdominal pain and
distention , at which time labs were within normal limits ,
including no white count , LFTs , but he did have ammonia of 81.
Plan was for paracentesis , but the patient refused and he left
AMA before follow up with his GI doctor could be arranged. His
family was unable to contact him on the evening on 6/11/2007 . A
friend was sent and checked him out in the following morning on
1/13/2006 and the patient was found alone in his apartment and
unresponsive. He was taken to the Charl Lubspi Hospital by EMS on 10/28/2007 , and the patient was tachycardic and
febrile to 100.2 , and only able to open eyes to commands ,
otherwise noncommunicative per report. A diagnostic and
therapeutic paracentesis of 4 liters was performed , which was
negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. His systolic
blood pressure dropped to the 80's post-paracentesis and he had
elevated cardiac enzymes with troponin of 0.49. The patient's
course at the outside hospital was also complicated by UTI ,
status post two days or ciprofloxacin and an acute renal failure
in the setting of diuresis ( creatinine rising from 0.8 and 1.5 ).
Given the patient's extensive history of cardiac/GI treatment at
the Systems/leaj Memorial Hospital , he was transferred to the Nonwelle Geshall Hospital Of on 4/8/2007 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: Undergoing liver transplant
workup. HAV , HCV reactive. HBV negative. Smooth muscle
antibody positive. Large volume ascites with multiple
paracenteses from 3/29 through 8/13 .  Liver biopsied on
8/12 with portal mononuclear inflammation ,
micro/macrovesicular steatosis , focal sinusoidal fibrosis.
2. CAD , status post stent: Cardiac cath done 3/16/2006
revealed proximal LAD with ostial 90% disease , 50% ??____?? LIMA
touchdown , 90% ostial left circumflex , totally occluded RCA ,
patent LIMA to LAD and patent SVG to PDA and radial to diagonal ,
but radial graft to OM was totally occluded. He had a bare-metal
stent placed to left circumflex lesion.
3. Status post CABG in 4/17 with LIMA to LAD , SVG to PDA ,
renal graft to OM and diagonal. Asymptomatic since CABG , but in

and 6 liters.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: On transfer , Mr. Davern is alert and
oriented , but still very confused with limited verbal
communication. Baseline ammonia on 1/26/2007 was 66. He was
continued on lactulose and rifaximin , which were titrated to a
goal to 3-4 bowel movements per day. During his hospitalization ,
the patient was noncompliant with lactulose regimen due to
confusion and had two episodes of decreased responsiveness. During these
episodes , there were no EKG or ABG changes suspicious for ischemia or
hypercapnia or hypoxia. Given his agitation , the patient was placed on
restraints after which
his mental status improved , inflicting a possible voluntary and
metabolic component is decompensation. He was able to contract
with healthcare team as his mental status improved and continued
to be compliant with his regimen. At discharge , he continues to
be alert and oriented , appropriately interactive , and an
ammonia of 16. Plans were to follow up with Dr. Chhuon for
continued evaluation of his possible liver transplant and
management of his hepatic encephalopathy. He should continue on
his lactulose regimen and rifaximin.
2. Ascites: Mr. Angeles 's intake weight was 225 pounds. He
underwent diagnostic therapeutic paracenteses x4. The first two
and fourth procedures removed 6 liters while the third procedure
removed 1.2 liters. Before and after each tap , the patient was
infused with IV albumin at 8 g/liter of ascites fluid removed.
Analysis of ascites fluid showed a SAAG of 1.4 , 2.7 , 3 , and 2.8
respectively , which is consistent with portal hypertension. The
ascites fluid was also negative for spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis. Following each procedure , Mr. Records remained
hemodynamically stable with blood pressures of 80-90/40-50. His
blood pressure and weights remained stable following
paracentesis , reflecting limited reaccumulation fluid.
Discharge weight is 299.9 pounds. He should continue on
diuretics to maintain his ascites at a reasonable level including
Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily and Aldactone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Renal insufficiency: Lasix and Aldactone were initially
started on Mr. Selim 's stay at the KVGH , but they were
discontinued after increasing in serum creatinine from baseline
of 0.8 to 1.4 at the time of transfer. The patient's renal
insufficiency was likely secondary to hypotension with consequent
renal hypoperfusion. Renal ultrasound at the outside hospital
was negative. Following transfer , Mr. Dayhoff was given empiric
hydration challenge with IV normal saline and albumin. He proved
responsive to this treatment with creatinine dropping from 1.4
to 1.1. He was restarted on Lasix 20 mg p.o. and Aldactone 50 mg
p.o. , and gradually titrated up to a discharge dose of Lasix 80
mg p.o. daily and Aldactone 200 mg p.o. daily. His serum
creatinine has remained stable at 0.7 to 0.9. He will follow up
with Dr. Averbeck .
4. Hypotension: Mr. Boger had been hypotensive at the outside
hospital following paracentesis with normal saline placement.
His regimen of lisinopril and nifedipine were consequently held
and discontinued. Given his systolic blood pressures of 80's to
90's , nadolol was also discontinued at the time of transfer.
Throughout his current hospitalization , Mr. Veroeven 's blood
pressures have remained stable in the 80-90/40-50.
5. Troponin leak: Mr. Swogger 's troponin leak at the outside
hospital is likely due to hypovolemic hypoperfusion. He was
continued on aspirin , Plavix , and Zocor at the outside hospital
as he has status post stents and CABG. At the time of transfer ,
his troponin had decreased from 0.49 to 0.15. He has maintained
on aspirin , Plavix , and Zocor , remained stable and asymptomatic
throughout the stay. A repeat troponin performed on 1/26/2007
was less than 0.1 ( less than assay ).
6. UTI: Mr. Couvertier had positive urinalysis at the outside
hospital. He was treated with 3-day course of Cipro. A
urinalysis performed during this admission was negative.
7. Guaiac-positive stool: Likely secondary to straining ,
esophageal , and anorectal varices. The patient's hematocrit had
been stable at 35 to 43. At discharge , recommended workup in EGD
as an outpatient with Dr. Graniela .
8. Contact dermatitis: On hospital day #9 , the patient
developed a contact dermatitis on inner aspect of his thighs ,
thought to be secondary to his urinary and fecal incontinence.
He was treated with topical hydrocortisone and miconazole. He
also developed an infected skin tag on his back , which was
treated with topical bacitracin. These should be continued to be
treated at rehab and followed up by his PCP.
9. Diabetes mellitus: Throughout his hospitalization , Mr.
Lynne blood glucose levels were well controlled with
fingerstick showing blood sugars to 100 to 190. The patient's
metformin and Avandia were held and he was started on insulin
sliding scale , but required minimal coverage. At discharge from
rehab , he should be restarted on his p.o. regimen of Avandia and
metformin. He will follow up with his PCP , Dr. Orizetti .
10. Heme: On admission , INR was 1.7 , likely due to decreased
synthetic function of his liver. He was given a 3-day course of
vitamin K with a good response. At the time of discharge , the patient's
INR was 1.6.
11. Code status: Full code.
12. Disposition: To rehab.

Discharge Date: 4/23/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS:
1. NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA.
2. HODGKIN'S DISEASE , STATUS POST MECHLORETHAMINE , VINCRISTINE ,
PROCARBAZINE , AND PREDNISONE CHEMOTHERAPY TEN YEARS AGO.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. STATUS POST TOTAL ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Three days of shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Kayser is an African American
female who is 72 years of age with a
history of Hodgkin's disease status post MOPP chemotherapy , and
more recently diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for which she
is being treated with CHOP chemotherapy. She was tolerating the
chemotherapy without complications until developing symptoms of
fatigue as well as shortness of breath over a three to four day
period prior to admission. In July 1997 , Ms. Vanzile presented to
the Oncology Clinic with a biliary obstruction that was shown to be
a peripancreatic mass and a left subclavicular lymph node. Biopsy
of the subclavicular lymph node revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ,
for which she was treated with CHOP chemotherapy. Given her
previous exposure to Adriamycin for treatment of Hodgkin's disease
ten years previously , the patient's cardiac function was followed
and serial echocardiograms over the past six months. The previous
three cycles of CHOP chemotherapy were complicated with a
peripancreatic abscess which was treated with intravenous then oral
antibiotics with good resolution. She , subsequently , three more
cycles of CHOP chemotherapy and was in near complete remission by
gallium scan; however , a persistent abdominal mass was still
detected on Computerized Tomography scan. Her therapy was stopped
after five cycle of CHOP due to the maximum Adriamycin dose of 460
mg/m2. The patient was being restaged and was found to develop
acute shortness of breath over the weekend , denying any chest pain ,
nausea or vomiting , or light-headedness. The patient denies any
changes in her activities except for becoming more tired with
exertion and wakening up suddenly the night prior to admission
feeling short of breath.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma , Hodgkin's
disease , hypertension , and a total abdominal
hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals a well-developed , well-nourished
elderly woman who is able to speak complete
sentences , but with some difficulty. Her vital signs were a heart
rate of 140; respiration rate of 32 to 36. Oxygen saturation of
92% on room air and is afebrile. The neck examination revealed a
jugular venous pressure of 8 centimeters. No thyromegaly or
lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Chest examination revealed
bilateral lower lobe rales , no rhonchi or wheezes were appreciated.
Coronary examination revealed tachycardic rate and rhythm with a
positive S3. The abdomen was benign. There is no edema at the
lower extremities.
LABORATORY: Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia at 130 ,
normal axes and intervals. No ST or T wave changes.
Her profile-7 is remarkable for a potassium of 3.3 , otherwise
unremarkable. The patient has an elevated LDH. Cholesterol level
was 243 and elevated triglyceride level of 197. Complete blood
count was significant for an elevated white count of 11 , 600;
hematocrit of 39.9 with an MCV of 91.2; and platelet count of
131 , 000. There was a normal differential of the complete blood
count. Her coags are also within normal parameters. The
urinalysis was benign.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Problem number one is the patient's shortness of
breath. Given the acute onset of shortness of
breath and dyspnea upon exertion , causes contributing to the change
in pulmonary status included pulmonary embolism , congestive heart
failure , and pneumonia. Of note , the patient's chest x-ray
revealed bilateral pleural effusions. However , the patient was
afebrile. Therefore , our suspicion for pneumonia was low. The
patient received an echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function.
The echocardiogram on June , 1997 , revealed a mildly enlarged
ventricle with moderately decreased systolic function. Estimated
ejection fraction was 30%. Global hypokinesis was identified along
with a marked significant involvement of the apex as well as the
anterior septal and inferior regions of the heart. Normal right
ventricular systolic function was observed. Also noted is that
there was a small pericardial effusion with an elevated PA pressure
of 36. There was also the existence of mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation. All of this had
little change from the echocardiogram taken on May , 1997 ,
which revealed an ejection fraction of 30% to 35% along with
hypokinesis and a small pericardial effusion. This was markedly
different from the patient's echocardiogram in January 1997 with
revealed an ejection fraction of 67% with normal left ventricular
function and no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was started
on a Lasix regimen in order to start diuresis with good response to
intravenous Lasix. The patient also was less dependent on oxygen
supplements , however , the patient still reported episodes of
dyspnea upon minor activity. A cardiology consultation was
obtained to evaluate the deterioration in the patient's cardiac
function. This deterioration was associated with the toxicity of
Adriamycin. A repeat echocardiogram was obtained to evaluate the
pericardial effusion as well as an abnormality identified on the
May , 1997 , echocardiogram consistent with a possible rupture
of one of the chordae tendineae. There was little difference
between the echocardiogram from May , 1997 , June , 1997 ,
and February , 1997. The patient was maintained on a regimen of
Lasix as well as Ace inhibitors. Initially , the addition of
ionatrope was considered. However , given the patient's history of
potassium and magnesium wasting , it was decided to add digoxin to
the patient's medical regimen.
The patient was also evaluated for the possibility of developing a
pulmonary embolus. Lower extremity noninvasive examinations
revealed patent vasculature , but no indication of a lower extremity
deep venous thrombosis. The patient also received a VQ scan which
revealed a low probability of the presence of a pulmonary embolus.
After the obtaining of a VQ scan which was negative , the heparin
that was initially stated upon admission of the patient , was
stopped.
The patient was discharged on a regimen of enalapril as well as
Lasix in order to manage the congestive heart failure. The
etiology of the congestive heart failure was thought to the
Adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy.
Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient has a history of
a potassium and magnesium wasting. Serial profile-7s were obtained
and potassium and magnesium were regularly supplemented. The
patient was discharged with a daily regimen of potassium.
DISPOSITION: The patient showed marked clinical improvement with
diuresis as well as actively reduction with an Ace inhibitor. The
patient was warned that she needed to watch her salt intake. Of
note , the patient was noted not to be compliant with a low-salt
diet. Three days before admission , the patient admitted to having
a Chinese food dinner which may have contributed to the patient's
element of congestive heart failure.
The patient was discharged with the following medications: Colace
100 mg b.i.d.; Vasotec 10 mg q.d.; Lasix 20 mg q.d.; KCl 10 mEq
q.d.; and magnesium gluconate 500 mg q.d.
The patient was discharged in stable condition , with followup with
Dr. Gransberry of Lourdesko Memorial Hospital Oncology.

The patient was admitted Watylake Hospital Cardiology
Service and Coronary Care Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Myocardial infarction.
2. Ventricular fibrillation arrest.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
2. Diabetes type 2.
3. Peripheral vascular disease.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. Depression.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ).
8. History of GI bleed.
9. Obstructive sleep apnea.
10. Status post cholecystectomy.
11. Status post coronary artery bypass graft with aortic valve
replacement.
12. History of transfusion reaction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old male
with coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass
graft in 1982 , also status post Bjork-Shiley aortic valve
replacement for bicuspid aortic valve , status post redo CABG in
1995 with SVG to OM2 and SVG to LAD , who presented to Nalcon Memorial Hospital after developing chest pain unrefractory to
nitroglycerin. En route to the ER , he suffered a ventricular
fibrillation arrest , was defibrillated x1 with 120 Joules to a
rhythm of pulseless electrical activity. He then received fluids
and lidocaine bolus and he recovered his pulse and blood pressure
and was intubated in the field.
Of note , the patient had an AVR Bjork-Shiley and saphenous vein
graft to LAD and left circumflex sequential grafting , original
surgery in 1982. In 1985 , he underwent reoperation with
saphenous vein graft to LAD and saphenous vein graft to OM2. He
has had multiple admissions to Estatewentlung Lufirm Community Medical Center in the past
year. In September 2003 , he was admitted with chest pain. He ruled in
for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and was taken to the
catheterization lab. At the cath lab in September 2003 , at Dotonh/ Medical Center he had a left main with a tight ostial lesion.
He had saphenous vein graft to LAD , it was patent , saphenous vein
graft to OM2 was patent with a tight 95% stenosis proximally in
OM2 at the touchdown site inhibiting retrograde profusion. It
was determined at this point that PCI would be inappropriate. At
that time and echo showed an EF of 25% with moderate mitral
regurgitation and right ventricular systolic pressures of 47. He
was medically managed on nitrates , an ACE inhibitor ,
beta-blocker , digoxin , and Lasix. Per his wife , he had been
doing well since April of 2003 , only sublingual nitrogens on
occasion , but today , on the day of admission he ate lunch with
his son and then developed his typical substernal chest pain , but
this time did not have relief with sublingual nitrogen x 3. He
called EMS who arrived at the scene and he had the following code
status mentioned above with a VF arrest and then a PEA arrest.
On arrival to Tonwa Medical Center he had a heart rate of 132 , blood
pressure 89/61 , and respiratory rate 28. He was given normal
saline 2 liters , dopamine drip , Lopressor 5 mg IV push , and he
was paralyzed , at which point it was determined that the patient
would likely need urgent cardiac catheterization for suspected
myocardial infarction. He was transferred the Specce Health Care Cardiac Cath lab emergently.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Coronary artery disease , status post CABG as noted above; history
of multiple non-Q-wave MIs in 1985 and subsequently history of
diabetes type 2 , peripheral vascular disease , depression , chronic
renal insufficiency , hypercholesterolemia , COPD , history of GI
bleed , peptic ulcer disease , obstructive sleep apnea , atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response , status post
cholecystectomy , status post aortobifem bypass graft in 1987 ,
history of transfusion reaction resulting in hemolysis.
ALLERGIES: He has no known medical allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Included insulin , Isordil , digoxin ,
aspirin , folate , Lasix , Lipitor , lisinopril , metoprolol ,
Protonix , and Coumadin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a current smoker. He is a retired truck
driver and he is married.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease and
diabetes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On presentation to Thara Healthcare , he had a pulse of 70 , blood pressure 87/54. He was
intubated and had a saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. He was
intubated and sedated. His JVP was 12 cm of water. He had a
regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2. No murmurs , rubs ,
or gallops. He had a mechanical S2. His abdomen was soft ,
nontender , and nondistended. Bilateral lower extremities were
cool and clammy with 1+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally. He had
ecchymosis as a result of his Coumadin use.
Initial labs were significant for a glucose of 220 , a CK of 565
with an MB of 74 and troponin of 14.0. Hematocrit was 48. His
INR was 1.7. Chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe infiltrate.
EKG with sinus rhythm and a left bundle-branch block with right
axis deviation. Also with inferior T-wave inversions and 1-mm ST
elevation in V3 and 1-mm ST depressions in I and O.
Echocardiogram previously on 3/3 revealed an EF of 39% with
inferior HK and AK , lateral HK , inferoapical DK. He had mild MR
and aortic radiant of 27/16. The right ventricular systolic
function is normal.
In summary , the patient is a 60-year-old male with chronic
coronary artery disease , now status post a VF arrest in the
setting of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with isolated ST
elevation in V3. He was admitted for critical care to the
Cardiac Intensive Care Unit at Lungken Medical Center .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was transferred
emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where
catheterization revealed severe native 3VD and vein graft
disease. His left main is moderately sized with a distal 60%
lesion. The mid LAD was proximally occluded after the first
septa. His left circumference is proximally occluded. The
distal LAD after vein graft is without significant disease and
the distal OM branch after the vein graft is diffusely diseased
with focal 99% lesion after the distal anastomosis. Saphenous
vein graft to LAD is patent , saphenous vein graft to OM has 99%
lesion in distal anastomosis with _____ flow and a tilting disk
aortic valve that appears to be functioning normally. In
summary , the patient had what was considered to be a
nonintervenable coronary artery disease and thus he was admitted
for medical management. He received optimal medical management
for his acute myocardial infarction including aspirin and Plavix ,
statin , beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor as tolerated. His ischemic
EKG changes have resolved at the time of transfer out of the
Coronary Care Unit and he has been chest pain-free for the
remainder of that day. His CK peaked at 1090 on 6/17/03 . Pump:
The patient was anticoagulated with heparin for a goal PTT of
6084 for his Bjork-Shiley valve. His Coumadin was held in the
setting. He had a TTE on 6/17/03 , which showed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 25% with inferoposterior HK ,
left atrial enlargement , mild to moderate MR , and well-seated
AVR. The patient was rapidly weaned off dopamine and
Neo-Synephrine during his ICU stay and he was transferred out to
the floor , once he was considered to be euvolemic. Rhythm: As
noted above , the patient admitted with status post VF arrest. He
was successfully defibrillated out of that with shock x 1.
However , his course was complicated by an episode of atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate up to the 160s
associated with hypotension for which he was electively
cardioverted with shock x 1 to normal sinus rhythm after which he
was loaded with a 10-g amio load , and he has remained in normal
sinus rhythm since that episode. However , after the patient had
been transferred to the floor and was stable , he received a
single lead AICD given his history of dilated cardiomyopathy ,
coronary artery disease , and status post VF arrest.
Pulmonary: The patient was initially intubated in the CCU for
airway protection. He was rapidly weaned on the sedation. He
was successfully extubated on 1/28/03 . However , his chest x-ray
was complicated by left lower lobe infiltrate , which was
concerning for pneumonia. He ultimately has sputum culture that
grew out pseudomonas and he has been treated with a 14-day course
for pseudomonal pneumonia. Please see ID section below for more
details.
Infectious Disease: The patient with hypotension and question of
sepsis , septic physiology on 1/28/03 . He was started on empiric
levofloxacin and Flagyl for question aspiration pneumonia by
chest x-ray. He was also given one dose of gentamicin and then
covered his broad into ceftaz , vanc , levo , and Flagyl while
awaiting results. He ultimately had no growth from any blood
cultures , although did have on sputum culture positive for
pseudomonas which was sensitive to ceftazidime , but resistant to
levofloxacin. He was ultimately switched over to single agent
ceftazidime for a total of 14-day course for pseudomonal
pneumonia/bronchitis.
Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of 1.6 and 2.0. In the Intensive Care Unit ,
he had a rise of his creatinine up to a peak of 2.8. At the time
of discharge , he still has slightly elevated creatinine at 2.2 ,
although it seems to be normalizing. It is likely that this is
contributed by his Dilaudid received at the time of
catheterization.
Heme: The patient anticoagulated at home with Coumadin and then
during his hospitalization with unfractionated heparin for his
Bjork-Shiley valve with a goal PTT of 60 to 80. At the time of
discharge , he is being recoumadinized with a goal INR of 2.5 to
3.5. Previously , his home dose of Coumadin had been 2 mg p.o.
q.d. He will need to have his heparin dripped to 10 units
therapeutically with PTT 60 to 80 until his INR is therapeutic on
Coumadin. Hematology continued the patient also with a
macrocytic anemia , currently on folate therapy. At the time of
discharge , his labs were pending for a B12 level , methylmalonic
acid , and homocysteine did need to be followed up while the
patient is at rehab.
Endocrine: The patient with diabetes. He was continued on NPH
with a Regular Insulin sliding scale with good control of his
sugars. At the time of discharge , he should remain on his NPH
with sliding scale coverage.
FEN: The patient was placed on ADA diet and his electrolytes were
repleted p.r.n.
Prophylaxis: The patient on therapeutic anticoagulation. He was
also placed on a proton pump inhibitor for symptomatic GERD.
Tubes , lines , and drains: The patient had an NG tube for a short
time during his Intensive Care Unit stay while was intubated for
enteral feeding. This was subsequently removed and the patient
has been able to take adequate p.o. intake. However , he has a
dual lumen peripherally inserted central catheter placed in his
right antecubital fossa on 3/9/03 for intravenous access for IV
heparin as well as to continue his 14-day course of ceftazidime.
Pertinent labs at the time of discharge include a BUN of 53 ,
creatinine of 2.2 , white blood cell count of 11.4 with 73% polys ,
20% lymphocytes , 6% monos , 2% eosinophils , and 1% basophils.
Hematocrit of 33.3 , which is stable , platelets of 175. His MCV
was 96.8 and his RDW was 18.0. His last PTT was 66.1 and INR was
1.3.

FUTURE CARE: It is recommended that the patient be restarted on
low-dose ACE inhibitor once his creatinine has stabilized. In
addition , he may benefit from further afterload reduction with
nitrates including Isordil , which he was on prior to this

ADMISSION INFORMATION/CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 83-year-old woman
with a history of coronary artery disease , status post remote IMI
( catheterization in 1989 with RCA occlusion ) , diabetes ,
hypercholesteremia , hypertension , admitted on 5/1/2005 for
chest pain. The patient experienced substernal chest pain
radiating to her left arm and shoulder while moving sofa. She
had associated diaphoresis and nausea but no shortness of breath.
She took 1 sublingual nitroglycerin and 2 aspirin. She was
subsequently transferred to the emergency department. There , her

through V6 as well as ST depressions in leads II , III , and aVF.
She was treated with 5 sublingual nitroglycerin tablets , aspirin ,
heparin , Lopressor , and morphine. She was subsequently taken to
the cardiac catheterization lab , then transferred to the CCU for
further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CARDIOVASCULAR: Anterolateral ST-elevation MI - On
5/1/2005 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which
revealed 100% stenosis of the LAD , 60% stenosis of the left
circumflex , 80% stenosis of the first marginal , and 100% stenosis
of the RCA , with collateral flow from the LAD to the RCA. Her
LAD was stented. She was treated with Integrilin , aspirin ,
Plavix , Lopressor , captopril , and Lipitor. Her peak cardiac
markers were on 8/29/2005 and were as follows: CK 3344 , MB
386.4 , troponin I 191.4. Her EKG changes were slow to resolve.
Her admission EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm , first-degree A-V
block , and new right bundle-branch block. On 8/29/2005 , the
patient developed transient complete heart block. Gel pads were
placed , but the patient regained her native rhythm. A temporary
wire was placed. On 4/21/2005 , the temporary wire failed to
capture and was adjusted. On 1/23/2005 , the patient was taken
back to the cardiac catheterization lab with the idea of
precluding any further ischemic triggers to complete heart block.
A stent was placed in the first marginal. On 10/4/2005 , early
in the morning , the patient aroused from bed ( despite bed-rest
precautions ). Her temporary wire was apparently dislodged. This
wire was then pulled. The patient developed chest pain without
EKG changes. She subsequently developed hypotension. There was
clinical evidence of tamponade including distant heart sounds and
cool extremities. The patient was taken emergently to the
cardiac catheterization lab. A stat echo performed in the
cardiac catheterization lab revealed a large pericardial effusion
with diastolic collapse of the right atrium and right ventricle.
A pericardiocentesis was performed for 600 mL of bloody fluid.
It was thought that the temporary wire had perforated the right
ventricle and that the whole failed on its own. In the cardiac
catheterization lab , the patient developed asystole. A temporary
wire was replaced. On 8/3/2005 and 10/22/2005 , echocardiogram
showed no evidence of pericardial effusion reaccumulation. The
patient's ejection fraction was preserved at 45 to 50%. There
was evidence of hypokinesis of the apical , inferoseptal , and
basal and mid inferior walls. On 10/22/2005 , the patient's
second temporary wire was pulled. The patient remained in her
native rhythm. She had rare runs of asymptomatic NSVT ranging
from 5 to 11 beats. She was without chest pain or shortness of
breath for the duration of her hospital stay. It was thought
that the patient did not require a permanent pacemaker or AICD
placement at the present time. The patient was discharged on
aspirin , Plavix , Toprol , lisinopril , and Lipitor. She had not
been on a statin previously. Her LFTs will require monitoring.
Notably , her fasting lipids included total cholesterol of 136 , an
HDL of 38 , an LDL of 98 , and triglycerides of 149.
2. PULMONARY: The patient required oxygen by nasal cannula
during her hospitalization. Status post pericardiocentesis , she
was weaned off oxygen. On the day of discharge , she was able to
ambulate on room air without desaturating.
3. ENDOCRINE: Diabetes mellitus. The patient was on oral
antihyperglycemics at home. In-house , she was treated standing
Lantus as well as Novolog standing and sliding scale q.a.c. She
was discharged on metformin. She has a normal creatinine
clearance.
4. HEME: Hematocrit. The patient's hematocrit dropped down
from the low 40s on admission to the low 30s on discharge. This
drop was attributed largely to blood loss ( right groin hematoma
status post 5/1/2005 cardiac catheterization - subsequently
stabilized; and pericardiocentesis on 10/4/2005 ). There was a
desire to keep the patient's hematocrit above 30 given her acute
coronary syndrome; however , the patient refused for transfusion.
In the days prior to discharge , the patient's hematocrit
stabilized. If her hematocrit remains low , she might benefit
from outpatient anemia workup , including iron studies , B12 ,
folate , reticulocyte count , and smear.
5. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Urinary tract infection. The patient
developed a urinary tract infection. Urine culture on 8/29/2005
showed greater than 100 , 000 proteus. She was treated initially
with levofloxacin , then Bactrim. A urine culture from 8/3/2005
showed no growth.
6. POSTPROCEDURE PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was treated
transiently with Ancef status post temporary wire placement.
Blood cultures on admission were negative. Blood cultures were
not rechecked given that the patient remained afebrile without
signs of bacteremia.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Colace 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 ( 0.4 mg ) 1 tab sublingual every
5 minutes x3 doses , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily , Plavix 75 mg p.o.
daily , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily , Toprol XL 150 mg p.o. daily ,
metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to take her
medications as directed , particularly the Plavix. The patient
was instructed to follow up with Dr. Vanbelle in clinic on
6/24/2005 and with Dr. Bradly Moerke at the Medwinds Hospital .  She was instructed to call her doctor and present
to the emergency room if she experienced any chest pain ,
shortness of breath , palpitations , fainting , or any other
symptoms concerning to her.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with home
services.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 47 year old white
male with a history of
insulin-dependent diabetes , hypertension , and coronary artery
disease. The patient presents with multiple syncopal episodes in
the week prior to admission. Cardiac risk factors include
diabetes , hypertension and a positive family history. He does not
smoke and has normal cholesterol. He has chronic stable angina for
which he needs one to three nitroglycerin per day over several
months. He has been gaining weight and has increasing peripheral
edema. He also notes decreased exercise tolerance and increasing
fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. He complains of PND but denies
orthopnea. In 2/10 he had a standard Bruce exercise test in which
he went 8 minutes and 15 seconds , stopping for typical chest pain
with a heart rate of 150 and blood pressure of 186/90. He had no
EKG changes and no arrhythmias. Thallium scanning showed anterior
and apical perfusion defects with delayed reperfusion.
Echocardiography at that time showed mild concentric hypertrophy
and akinesis of the anterior , lateral and apical walls. He had
only mildly decreased left ventricular function and no valvular
disease. The patient has been admitted to the Shire Health Center where he has undergone coronary angiography ,
which showed that his coronary arteries had no significant
obstruction. Over the week prior to admission he had four episodes
of syncope which occurred at various times , not related to meals.
He was usually standing or walking just prior to the episode.
There is a 15 to 30 second prodrome of nausea , diaphroresis , and
the sensation of spinning. He does not have chest pain or
shortness of breath. He has had a total of four episodes with loss
of consciousness and falling. He does have urinary incontinence
but has not been witnessed to have involuntary movements. There is
no post ictal state. There has been no recent change in his
medical regimen. The patient also describes the symptoms of
snoring at night with fatigue and has been noticed to make gasping
sounds during sleep. He complains of waking up frequently at night ,
feeling as though he cannot catch his breath and admits to a weight
gain of 100 pounds over the last several years. He has a history
of depression and suicidal ideation and currently is depressed and

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Afebrile with a normal pulse and blood
pressure of 130/90. He was not orthostatic ,
head and neck benign. No carotid bruits. Lungs clear. Heart: He
has a normal S1 and S2 with an S4. There is no murmur. Abdomen
obese without masses. Rectal: Guaiac negative. Normal prostate.
He has edema to his knees bilaterally. Neurologic: He has
pressured speech and a tearful affect. He is alert and oriented.
CNs intact. Motor strength is full. He has no sensory deficits
and normal position sense. He has diminished reflexes throughout
but downgoing toes bilaterally.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: He had a glucose of 323 , but otherwise
normal admission laboratories except for
an LDH of 529 and an alkaline phosphatase of 151. Admission CK was
138 , amylase of 56 , lipase of 52. Hemoglobin A1C 8.3 , cholesterol
170 , UA shows 2+ glucose. Chest x-ray shows a normal size heart
with clear lungs. EKG shows sinus at 70 with normal axis and
intervals. There are flat T waves in I , L , and III , but no change
from a previous EKG.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent Holter monitoring in which
he had no arrhythmias. He occasionally had sinus
tachycardia. An exercise test showed that he went six minutes and
17 seconds of a standard Bruce protocol. His maximum heart rate
was 140 and blood pressure was 210/60. There were no EKG changes
with the exception of unifocal PVCs , so that there was no evidence
for ischemia. He had an echocardiogram which showed normal valves
and normal left ventricular function. Notably the right side of
his heart was also normal. The patient also underwent sleep study
during the day after sleep deprivation the previous night. The
study lasted only 1-1/2 hours and the patient was not noted during
that time to have sleep apnea. However , an overnight study was
recommended.
DISPOSITION: Discharge medications are the same as his admission
medications with the addition of Prozac 20 mg
p.o.q.d. He follows up with Dr. Lonnie Otanicar in RY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL clinic.

Discharge Date: 5/13/1992
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 72 year old black female
with a history of hypertension ,
angina , adult onset diabetes , admitted after a syncopal event. She
has a known history of syncope which dates as far back as the late
1960s. In 1970 she had an episode of loss of consciousness with 30
seconds of generalized tonic convulsions witnessed by her daughter.
An EEG at that time showed diffuse theta waves but was nonfocal.
The patient was treated with Dilantin for less than a year. In
1972 she had another episode of syncope associated with
hyperventilation. In 1983 she had yet another episode of syncope
and a 24 hour Holter started after the event showed a heart rate
that went as low as 38 but was not associated with any symptoms. In
1987 she had a vasovagal event which was later aggravated when her
neighbor gave her a nitroglycerin tablet. Throughout this time she
has had multiple other episodes of syncope. Her last episode was
in 1989 , when she was admitted to the Cardiology Team for workup.
Her EKG was unremarkable , 24 hour Holter was normal , an
echocardiogram was normal , and she underwent an exercise stress
test which did not show ischemic changes. In October of 1992 , she
had carotid ultrasounds for symptoms of right hand and leg
numbness. They did not show significant stenosis. In October of
1992 , she was admitted and ruled out for a myocardial infarction
and was started on Isordil and Lopressor empirically but these were
later discontinued. In February of 1992 she had a clinic visit with
Dr. Ed Ville who is her CALL MEDICAL CENTER doctor. The patient indicates
that she has stable exertional angina without limitation of daily
activity , chest pain is relieved with nitroglycerin and her most
recent episode was last week. She has also been on a stable dose
of Micronase for the last couple of years. On the morning of
admission , the patient awoke and felt fine , and was getting ready
to have coffee with her friends upstairs. She was reaching for
something across the table and suddenly felt a sharp pain in her
back and fell unconscious into the chair. Estimated loss of
consciousness was 6-7 minutes. She awoke confused , did not know
her name and had a little bit of difficulty seeing. It was unclear
by her history whether her vision was blurry or whether she felt
that there was a shade across her eyes. She denies any double
vision. Prior to this event she did not experience any prodrome or
aura. She also denied chest pain , shortness of breath or
palpitations. There was no loss of bladder or bowel function
during the event. The patient was given orange juice after the
episode and gradually she regained awareness of her surroundings.
Her vital signs were stable. She was brought to Tia Medical Center
for evaluation. There was a question of upper extremity twitching
by report from observers. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension
dating at least 10 years back and is presently not requiring any
treatment. She has a history , as mentioned , of recurrent syncopal
events. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with adult onset
diabetes and has been on a stable dose of Micronase. The patient
also has a history of multiple colonic polyps and in 1983 underwent
a left hemicolectomy for multiple polyps. In 1988 she underwent an
ileal resection for large inflammatory polyps leading to a small
bowel obstruction. She has had a cholecystectomy and an
appendectomy in the distant past. The patient also a history of
glaucoma. In 1973 and 1976 she had a right lower extremity DVT ,
etiology was unclear. The patient does not smoke , drink or use any
drugs. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION include aspirin one tablet q d ,
Questran one pack q d , Micronase 5 mg po q d , Betaxolol eye drops
bid to each eye , Pilocarpine eye drops tid to each eye ,
eye drops bid to each eye. The patient receives monthly Vitamin
B12 injections. She also takes nitroglycerin with chest pain.
FAMILY HISTORY is significant for a brother who suffered a stroke
at the age of 74. There is also a family history of heart attacks.
No family history of gastrointestinal cancer. SOCIAL HISTORY: The
patient is separated and lives by herself in Hutmill Rd. , Bock Tonlake Son , North Dakota 32472 She has
eight children with many grandchildren. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS is
notable for episodes of sweats and nervousness over the last week
which she describes as being similar to the hot flashes of
menopause which she had at age 49. These episodes are occurring a
few times a day but do not in any way coincide with her syncopal
events. She is also complaining of right hand and foot numbness
which have increased in frequency. The numbness occasionally wakes
her up at night. She denies any motor weakness whatsoever.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is an elderly , mildly obese female , in
no apparent distress. She was afebrile , with
a blood pressure of 126/70 , a heart rate of 60 , and a respiratory
rate of 18. HEENT exam was notable for pinpoint constriction of
her pupils secondary to her glaucoma eyedrops. Her pupils were
reactive. Her throat was benign. She had dentures. Her neck was
supple , without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. Chest exam
revealed bibasilar , coarse crackles. On cardiac exam she had no
jugular venous distention , and carotids were normal without bruits.
She had a regular rate and rhythm with S1 , S2 , and an occasional
S4. There were no murmurs. Abdominal exam was benign. The patient
was guaiac negative. Extremities were without edema and there was
no calf tenderness. The neurologic exam was entirely nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Includes a sodium of 143 , potassium of 4.3 ,
chloride of 109 , bicarbonate of 20 , BUN of 21;
creatinine was 1.0. The glucose was 160. Her calcium and
phosphate were normal. Her hematocrit was 43.4 , her white count
6.45 with a normal differential. Her coagulation factors were
normal. Her liver function tests were normal. A chest X ray
showed a calcific aorta but was otherwise clear. C spine X ray and
head CT on admission were also negative. The EKG showed no changes
from her baseline.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was placed on a cardiac monitor , and
her Micronase was held. In fact , her fingerstick
glucose went as low as 80 that evening. On day two of admission ,
the patient had syncopal event while in house. She was apparently
walking about after having washed her face and was reaching to pull
the curtain when she began feeling lightheaded. She told the nurse
immediately , who tried to get her on the bed , and the patient
collapsed on the bed , was limp and lost consciousness for about 3-5
minutes. She had a systolic blood pressure of 200/105 and a heart
rate of 90. There were no changes on the cardiac monitor , and the
patient was noted to maintain a strong pulse at all times. She was
given Nitro Paste and 1 amp of D50. Fingerstick glucose was then
noted to be 232. The patient was witnessed to have mild twitching
of her jaw and eyelids and after five minutes , she opened her eyes
but was not able to respond. When asked to give her name , she was
not able to answer. The confusion subsided over the next couple of
minutes , and the patient was able to respond and was alert and
oriented. However , she had no recollection of the event. Further
workup included a head MRI , MR angiogram of her vertebrobasilar
circulation , a sleep deprived EEG , a cardiac echo , and a 24 hour
Holter. All of the above were negative. We also applied carotid
sinus stimulation and she showed no change in heart rate to either
side. The etiology of her syncopal event is not completely clear.
It appears that the patient does have a history of a witnessed
seizure but also has had syncopal events consistent with either
bradycardia or a vasovagal event.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home with plans for a
repeat 24 hour Holter as an outpatient. FOLLOW UP:
She will follow up with Dr. Danilo Mcquaid in the THERPLEA HOSPITAL Clinic.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS include

Discharge Date: 9/22/2003
Date of Discharge: 9/22/2003
ATTENDING: SYDNEY VELOVIC MD
SERVICE: Chief Surgery.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 72-year-old male
who presented to his primary care doctor in early September with
dysphagia and acolasia and epigastric pain. He had an upper
endoscopy which showed an ulcer in the distal esophagus and
proximal stomach. He had a repeat EGD and biopsies of the ulcer
which showed adenocarcinoma of the proximal stomach and distal
esophagus. Metastatic workup showed only thickening at the GE
junction and one enlarged lymph node in the periportal region 3.4
x 1.6 cm. The patient was referred to Dr. Dunks for resection
and was planned for an esophagectomy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history includes
hypertension , ischemic cardiomyopathy , noninsulin dependent
diabetes , kidney stones , status post laser lithotripsy , history
of hyponatremia , myocardial infarction six years ago ,
hypercholesterolemia , and an infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm.
HOME MEDICATIONS: Prevacid 30 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 10 mg q.day ,
Toprol-XL 50 mg q.day , Glyburide 2.5 mg q.day , Zestril 5 mg
q.day , aspirin 325 mg q.day and Coumadin alternating 5 and 2.5 mg
p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient came into the hospital , after
admission was taken to the operating room on 9/5/03 . In the
operating room he underwent exploratory laparotomy biopsy of a
portacaval lymph node. Uterolithotomy on the right side , liver
biopsy , cystoscopy , placement of double J ureteral stent on the
right side and open nephrolithotomy. The large right ureteral
stone was found upon exploration and urology was called for an
intraoperative consult. Please see both Dr. Moriarity and Dr.
Cushard dictated reports for more information. There was a
very high amount of blood loss approximately 17 liters
intraoperatively from venous plexus bleeding of the pelvis and
kidney and the patient was closed after stomach mobilization
without resection of his tumor and admitted to the Angeles Vandie Morepa surgical
intensive care unit. The patient was left intubated due to his
large fluid and blood product replacement and surrounding facial
edema. He was kept intubated , paralyzed and sedated , started on
Lopressor , put on a rule out MI protocol , kept NPO with an
NG-tube. His electrolytes , CBC and coagulation labs were
corrected. The patient had multiple abdominal drains and was
kept on triple antibiotics. Over the next several days , the
patient was kept intubated and sedated. His chest x-rays
revealed some early ARDS and he continued to need blood product
including red cell and platelet and FFP transfusions. He
underwent bronchoscopy in the intensive care unit and was slowly
weaned on his valve dilatory settings. Over postop day 4 , 5 and
6 the patient began to spike some fevers up to 102. He had been
weaned to pressure support ventilation and was beginning to auto
diurese. He then started on tube feeds of small amounts which
were increased as tolerated.
Over the next couple of days as the patient's sedation was weaned
and he woke up more , it was noticed that he had decreased
movement of his left lower extremity and upon examination and
given his recurrent fevers , there was a question of an epidural
hematoma. He was scheduled for an MRI to assess this. He was
tolerating tube feeds well and these were increased and his labs
were stabilizing. Neurosurgery was consulted and it was
ascertained that the patient did have an epidural hematoma ,
therefore his epidural was removed and this was deemed likely to
be secondary to trauma from the epidural. It was decided that
the patient would benefit from evacuation of epidural hematoma
and the patient was made NPO and taken back to the operating room
on 8/18/03 . He underwent a T5-T8 laminectomy with evacuation of
the epidural hematoma. Please see the dictated operative report
for more information , but a handful of clot was removed from the
area. The patient was transferred back to Or Ox Nor , intubated and
stable having tolerated the procedure well.
Thereafter , the patient was more awake and alert and more quickly
weaned off his ventilatory support. His fingersticks were more
difficult to control and he was therefore started on the
Heartland protocol and was seen by the Diabetes Management
Service. The patient was extubated on 9/11/03 and was doing well
on a face mask on that day. His tube feeds were restarted and
speech and swallow was consulted to evaluate the patient. He
began to be seen by physical therapy for his lower extremity
weakness. The Cardiology Service was consulted on 8/18 and asked
to optimize medical management of the patient's ischemic
cardiomyopathy. They recommended discontinuing and titrating the
patient's Lopressor. He had been somewhat tachycardic previously
and this resolved shortly. Speech and swallow saw the patient
and initially cleared him for soft foods and thickened foods and
this was likely just due to endotracheal tube trauma. After
another day or two they cleared him for all regular foods
including thin liquids without any restrictions.
For the patient's epidural hematoma , he had been started on
Vancomycin and it was decided that he would get a total of a
three week course of Vancomycin. Urology continued to followed
the patient and wanted at least one Blake drain kept in place and
the Foley catheter kept in place. The patient did have a CT scan
on 10/19/03 which demonstrated no urine leak on the CT urogram.
The patient continued to be seen by physical therapy every day
and was doing very well. It was very difficulty initially to
normalize him but by the time of discharge he was up walking with
the walker with physical therapy and doing quite well.
Infectious disease was consulted to confirm the three week course
of Vancomycin was appropriate for the patient's epidural
hematoma , and they agreed and thought no other interventions or
treatment as needed at the time. The patient was transferred out
of the intensive care unit on 10/19/03 .
Neuro: At this time he was getting increasingly more oriented.
He had had some ICU psychosis and confusion and he was taking no
pain medication. He was stable from his neurosurgery procedure
and neurosurgery was following him.
Pulmonary: His lungs were clear. He was now stable on room air.
From a cardiovascular standpoint , he was stable and continued on
his low dose Lopressor.
Gastroenterology: He was tolerating a house diet , eating small
amounts.
GU: As stated , the urologist wanted to keep the Foley catheter
and keep one of the Blake drains upon discharge.
From a hematology standpoint , the patient had a stable
hematocrit. From an infectious disease standpoint , the patient
was continued on IV Vancomycin for three weeks. He had a PICC
line placed on 9/22/03 which was put in good position.
From an endocrine standpoint , he was placed on glyburide ,
continued to be followed by diabetes and also on a humalog scale.
From an activity standpoint , he was seen by physical therapy
every day.
Over the ensuing few days he was begun on calorie counts to see
how much of the diet he was tolerating and he continued to work
with physical therapy. His glyburide and insulin doses were
tweaked a little bit by the diabetes management service and he
was improving every day as was his mental status. He had been
discharged from the unit with a one-to-one sitter but this was
very soon thereafter stopped on 10/21/03 . He was stable medically
about 3/11 or 2/4/03 for discharge and was ______ for a
rehabilitation facility appropriately. He was accepted to a
rehab facility near his home on 5/16/03 , Dis University Hospital and was ready
to go.
From a neurologic standpoint , he is awake and oriented x3 most of
his time. His back limbs are stable. The staples have been
removed by neurosurgery and he will follow up with Dr. Ochwat
from Neurosurgery in a couple of weeks. From a cardiovascular
standpoint , he has been restarted on all of his home medications
and his blood pressure and heart rate had been stable on those.
From a pulmonary standpoint , he currently has no issues and is
breathing well on room air. From a GI standpoint , he is
tolerating an ADA diet with diabetic booster , Ensure and has been
eating fairly well the last couple of days. From a GU
standpoint , he is urinating sufficiently and he will keep his
Foley catheter and Blake drain. From an endocrine standpoint , he
is on glyburide twice a day and twice a day fingersticks with
humalog sliding scale. From an infectious disease standpoint , he
has a well functioning PICC and has been fine and will begin on
Vancomycin for a total of three weeks. Today , 5/16/03 is day 8 of
21 of the Vancomycin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: On physical exam , the patient
is awake and oriented in no acute distress. His lungs are clear
to auscultation bilaterally. His heart is regular , rate and
rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen is soft , nontender ,
nondistended with a well healing midline incision scar with some
Steri-Strips still in place. He has one Blake drain in place on
the right side which is functioning well. His extremities have
no edema and his Foley catheter is in place and working well.

Discharge Date: 5/25/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HEMOPTYSIS.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45 year-old male who
presents to the Wek Bri Medical Center Emergency Department with low back pain and a five day
history of hemoptysis. The patient has an extensive psychiatric
history and an apparent history of tuberculosis treated in 1987 for
one year ( confirmation of this fact is not found at the present
time ). The patient presents with a five day history of hemoptysis.
The patient notes that he has had blood tinged sputum and
occasional bright red blood for the past five days totalling about
1/8th of a cup a day. He denies any fevers , chills or other sputum
production , but he notes a positive cough. He is homeless and was
exposed to cold and rain during the past week. He has had no
tuberculosis follow-up since 1988. The patient also has
long-standing lower back pain. He had a previous accident where he
was pinned between two cars at age 17. He has had pain in his
lower lumbar spine and occasional sharp pain that radiates down
both legs. He notes no weakness in his lower extremities , no
incontinence. This pain has increased substantially over the past
two months. The patient has noted an extensive psychiatric
history , evidently followed by Dr. Ruedy at the Acjames General Medical Center at the Albriel Health Care Services ( number 184-4108. ) The
patient was apparently diagnosed with paranoid schizoid
disorder vs. bipolar vs. schizophrenia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Tuberculosis , status post treatment
possibly for one year in 1987 , though no
confirmation of this has been found. 2 ) Psychiatric disorder. 3 )
Status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Prolixin 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )
Depakote 500 mg p.o. q. AM , 1 , 000 mg
p.o. q.h.s. 3 ) Cogentin 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 96.7 degrees ,
heart rate 100 , blood pressure 130/80. Head
and neck examination revealed that the pupils were equal , round and
reactive to light. Extraocular movements were intact. There was
no scleral icterus. Oropharynx was clear. Neck was supple without
any adenopathy , no jugular venous pressure was noted.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm with a two
out of six holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex , no S3 or S4.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen was obese ,
soft , non-tender , positive bowel sounds. Extremities revealed no
clubbing , cyanosis or edema noted. There were good peripheral
pulses. On rectal examination , the patient had good tone and was
guaiac negative. Neurologically , the patient was intact. On
admission , the patient received a chest x-ray which showed a
possible ground glass infiltrate in the right medial segment of the
upper lung field approximately 1 cm in size , otherwise clear lung
fields.
LABORATORY: The patient's laboratory examinations on admission
were all within normal limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for rule out
tuberculosis and was subsequently kept in the
respiratory isolation room and serial induced sputums were sent for
culture and stain and noted to be negative for acid fast
bacilli or other signs of tuberculosis. The patient was also noted to have no
further signs of hemoptysis while he was in the
hospital and therefore his history of hemoptysis has not been
verified. The patient was very cooperative while in the hospital
and showed no signs of being febrile or other signs of active
infection. No other signs of pulmonary
infection were identified that could account for hemoptysis.
It also did not appear that the patient had any form of possible lung
malignancy because he did not report weight loss or other suggestive features
To further work-up this up however , the patient
received a spiral CT scan of his chest which showed no focal
abnormalities and was notable for clear lung fields and no signs of
tuberculosis. As this was the case , the patient was subsequently
discharged home having been ruled out for tuberculosis. Notable
also , his PPD was negative at 48 hours with a positive mumps and
Candida anergy panel also suggestive of not having tuberculosis.
The patient was evaluated by Psychiatry while inhouse who was in
touch with his primary psychiatrist. The patient was continued on
his medications and noted to be quite stable while he was in the
hospital. He was deemed not medically able to make his own
decisions on admission and was therefore not allowed to leave
when the patient tried to leave on the night of admission. He was
very cooperative however over the course of his admission and was
followed by Psychiatry who have arranged follow-up with him upon
discharge. The patient was seen by Social Work who is actively
working with him to establish a shelter or other place to stay upon
discharge. The patient is amendable to this and anxious to receive
assistance. The patient was subsequently discharged on July , 1997 in good condition with the name and addresses of possible
places to stay and close follow-up with a social worker and his
psychiatrist.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Cogentin 0.1 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )
Depakote 100 mg p.o. q. AM , 200 mg p.o.

Discharge Date: 10/3/2005
ATTENDING: KELLEY , IRWIN M.D.
SERVICE: Orthopedic Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Infected left total hip replacement.
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: Removal of infected cemented left total hip
replacement with debridement of the hip and placement of
antibiotic-impregnated cement spacers on 2/16/05 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Beish is a 46-year-old female
with multiple medical problems who initially sustained a left hip
intertrochanteric fracture in October of 2004 and underwent an
ORIF with a DHS on 10/15/04 . The screw ultimately cut off and
she underwent removal of hardware on 9/28/04 with insertion of a
hemiarthroplasty with antibiotic beads. Her culture grew
coag-negative staph at that time and she was treated with six
weeks of IV antibiotics. After multiple hip aspirations to
confirm that the joint was no longer infected , she underwent a
left total hip replacement on 8/15/04 by Dr. Sweis . She ended
up being hospitalized in Gassonvenchand Pendinea Port from 3/5/05 to 8/16/05
with an E. coli bacteremia of unclear etiology , although it was
felt likely secondary to pyelonephritis. During that
hospitalization , she developed neck pain and was found to have
MRSA osteomyelitis at C6-C7. She underwent a C6-C7 I&D infusion
on 5/24/05 . She ultimately completed 16 weeks of IV vancomycin
for her MRSA spinal infection and at the completion of the
vancomycin therapy in February of 2005 , was started on minocycline
with a plan for a six-month treatment. She ultimately presented
to Dr. Amoako 's office on 7/13/05 with increasing left
groin/hip/lateral thigh pain over several months duration. Two
left hip aspirates in August , both grew MRSA , and as such , she
was scheduled for an explant of her left total hip replacement
with insertion of an antibiotic spacer on 2/16/05 .

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is single and lives alone in Utah She quit smoking tobacco 25 years ago and does not drink
alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for an obese
female , ambulates with a walker and an antalgic gait on the left.
She had mild tenderness with palpation in her mid cervical
spine. She had some mild distal left upper extremity and
proximal left lower extremity weakness. Gentle range of motion
of her left hip caused pain.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 1/9/05 for
initiation of IV antibiotic therapy at the request of the
Infectious Disease Service under the direction of Dr. Willy H Kirkey . Prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy , she had
blood cultures drawn , which ultimately showed no growth. Given
her neck pain and slight weakness , she also had an MRI of her
cervical spine performed , which showed no evidence of
osteomyelitis. Preoperatively , she was seen by both the
Infectious Disease Consult Service as well as the Medical Consult
Service. She was placed on a low-dose beta-blocker at the
recommendation of the Medical Consult Service. On the morning of
hospital day 2 , the beta-blocker was then discontinued under the
recommendation of the Medical Consult Service , as it was felt to
likely add little benefit. She did receive one dose of Coumadin
the night before surgery in preparation for DVT prophylaxis. She
was ultimately taken to the operating room on hospital day 2
where she underwent removal of her left total hip replacement
with irrigation , debridement and placement of an antibiotic
spacer. Estimated blood loss was 2.5 L. She received six units
of packed red blood cells , 9 L of crystalloid and 1 L of albumin.
Intraoperatively , gross pus was found. Intraoperative cultures
were sent , which ultimately grew MRSA. The patient received
perioperative stress dose hydrocortisone. Postoperatively , she
was taken to the surgical intensive care unit and intubated. Her
postoperative hematocrit was 29.2. The morning of postoperative
day 1 , the patient remained intubated but was able to open her
eyes and follow commands. She was neurovascularly intact in the
left lower extremity. She was treated with Lovenox only
initially given that she did not initially have an NG tube so
that p.o. medications including Coumadin could be administered.
She was continued on the vancomycin. The patient remained
intubated throughout the remainder of postoperative day 1 and
into the morning of postoperative day 2. Her hematocrit had
drifted down to 22.4 on postoperative day #1 for which she was
transfused two units with her hematocrit up to 26.2. She
continued to remain hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly
intact. An NG tube had been placed on postoperative day 1 , so
that p.o. medications including her Mestinon could be given for
her myasthenia gravis. She was ultimately extubated mid morning
on postoperative day 2. Her dressing was changed at that time
and the incision was clean and intact without any erythema. The
patient remained in the surgical ICU until postoperative day 3 ,
mainly with continued pain issues. She had been on a fentanyl
drip and was transitioned over to Dilaudid PCA. She was started
on clear diet on postoperative day 3 and transitioned over to
regular insulin sliding scale from the insulin drip that she had
been on to the early a.m. hours of postoperative day 3. Her
hematocrit remained stable in the high 20s. Her right IJ central
line was changed out over a wire under sterile technique in the
ICU on postoperative day 3 prior to transfer to the floor. She
was transferred to the floor in stable condition lat in the day
on postoperative day 3. She was taking p.o.'s at that time and
her home medications were restarted including her home
prednisone. Postoperative day 4 , pain continued to be her main
issue and she was seen by the Chronic Pain Service for
recommendations on transitioning her off of the high-dose
Dilaudid PCA. PCA was discontinued and she was started on p.r.n.
oxycodone in addition to her home a fentanyl patch and OxyContin.
Physical Therapy worked with the patient throughout her hospital
stay and were able to first sit her up on the edge of the bed on
postoperative day 4. She continued to remain afebrile ,
hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly intact throughout the
remainder of her hospitalization. Her hematocrit was stable in
the high 20s. She had a PICC line placed on postoperative day 5
for administration of her long-term IV vancomycin. The Pain
Service continued to see the patient and titrate her pain
medications with gradually improving effect. The Foley was
discontinued the morning of postoperative day 6 , as the patient
began to be able to move around a little more easily. By
postoperative day 7 , she was more comfortable , was tolerating a
regular diet and voiding q. shift without a Foley. She was
afebrile , hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly intact. She
was continued on both Coumadin and Lovenox given that her INR was
still not therapeutic. She should continue on the Coumadin with
a Lovenox bridge until the INR is therapeutic. The patient was
cleared for transfer to rehab on postoperative day 7 by the
Orthopedic Infectious Disease and Physical Therapy services. She
was accepted for transfer to the Biger Community Hospital in Ee ,

since last cath 99
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
50 yo with CAD s/p PTCA with stent to 1st diag in 1999 , also with
chronic lower back pain with intrathecal morphine pump. Presents with
chest pain in context of 12 hours nausea/vomiting/dry heave likely
secondary to morphine withdrawal from malfunctioning pump. Chest pain
relieved with SL NTG x3. Enzyme leak , troponin 1.3 at outside hospital
--> NQWMI. Pt transferred for cath to evaluate stent. Cath 5/10/01
showed patent D1 stent , 50% LAD , 60% PDA with likely accelerated
idioventricular rhythm post cath. He was transferred to cards
for evaluation of rhythm and optimization of cardiac management.
Pt has been asymptomatic on morphine PCA ( pending arrival of
intrathecal pump infusion per pain service ). HTN was controlled with
clonidine , and his ECG normalized. Chest pain was thought
to be secondary to increased demand during acute withdrawal. Will
Pump was refilled per pain service , and his cardiac regimen was
optimized. Outpatient cardiology follow up with stress test to risk
stratify was arranged. Patient's urine output was marginal on 3/16/01 .
He was hydrated with modest response. BUN and creatinine were stable.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Call your doctor or go to emergency room if you develop chest pain ,
lightheadedness , worsening shortness of breath , or palpitations. Follow
-up appointments have ben scheduled for cardiology , cholesterol
management , and primary care.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Weakness , shortness of breath , worsening over one
month.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: THis is a 71 year old male with
diabetes mellitus , asthma , history of
guaiac positive stool , history of angina now with increased
weakness and shortness of breath progressive over one month. He
has required increased metered dose inhalers for ""asthma"" over the
past two weeks and has become progressively short of breath over
one block where he used to be able to walk ""all the way into town.""
He denied dizziness , myalgias , no fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting
or diarrhea but did complain of a decreased appetite and ten pound
weight loss over the past month. He said he has had black stools
times three weeks with constipation and said that he stopped his
iron pills about a month ago because he just had too many pills to

and Zantac 150 b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Positive tobacco pack per day , ETOH occasionally
and he lives with his wife. He doesn't work.
FAMILY HISTORY: Unknown.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile at
97.8 with heart rate of 80 , blood pressure
110/50 , lying down and sitting up heart rate of 88 and blood
pressure of 120/50. He was satting 97% on room air. GENERAL: He
was awake , alert , Spanish speaking male , poor historian. HEENT:
NC/AT , EOMI , PERRLA. OROPHARYNX: Negative with moist mucous
membranes. NECK: He had no JVP. CORONARY: Regular rate , no
murmurs , rubs or gallops. LUNGS; Crackles bilaterally at bases.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , tympanic with good bowel sounds and no
peritoneal signs. RECTAL: Showed guaiac positive brown stool.
EXTREMITIES: Warm , dry but poorly palpable peripheral pulses.
Cranial nerves examination showed II/XII grossly intact and motor
and sensory exams were without gross deficit.
LABORATORY: His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with first degree
AV block , rate of 78 , PR of 212 , QRS of 96 and QT 448
with axis of 57. He had some flat Ts in AVL and T wave inversion
in V1. His chest x-ray had no infiltrate , no effusion and no
evidence of failure. Laboratory revealed sodium of 138 , potassium
of 4.1 , chloride 103 and bicarbonate of 25 with BUN of 17 and
creatinine 1.2. His baseline was 0.7 in 4/10 .  Glucose was 186 and
anion gap of 10. He had a white count of 8.2 , hematocrit of 17.9
which his baseline was 39.5 in 4/10 , platelets of 280 and MCV of
68. He had 66 neutrophils , 21 lymphs and 8 monos and PT of 12.1 ,
PTT of 21.3 and INR of 1.0. His CK was 47 and Troponin was 21.9.
His amylase was 28 and lipase was 187.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By problem list: Heme: He had a hematocrit of
17.9 down from baseline of 39.5. He was
transfused three packed red blood cells and his hematocrit
responded appropriately. It was 34.5 by the day of discharge. He
also had iron studies sent off that showed a total iron binding
capacity of 324 and ferritin of 20 consistent with iron deficiency
anemia. He was restarted on Niferex.
GI: Given this guaiac positive stool and history of guaiac
positive stool in 1999 , he was thought to have an acute on chronic
GI bleed questionably secondary to diverticulosis or cancer. He
also has history of gastritis. We kept him NPO. GI consult was
obtained. He underwent initially an esophagogastroduodenoscopy
which was completely normal. Esophagus had no varices , no
esophagitis. Stomach was normal; no ulcer , no erosion or end NSAID
gastropathy. His duodenum to D3 was normal with small
periampullary diverticulum. Colonoscopy was then performed which
found sigmoid diverticulosis , 4 millimeter non-bleeding sessile
polyp which was removed by snare cautery and some mild oozing after
the polypectomy but good hemostasis was achieved. Small , internal
hemorrhoids were present but no active bleeding sites were found.
On pathology , it was found to be a hyperplastic polyp. GI team
recommended small bowel follow through to rule out small bowel
source for bleeding as an outpatient. The patient was kept on his
Zantac 150 b.i.d. for history of gastritis. The patient was sent
home on Tylenol for pain and told to avoid taking aspirin or any
other NSAIDs given his GI bleed.
Renal: Creatinine was 1.2 on admission. His baseline was 0.9. He
received some IV fluids as he was NPO for his GI studies and his
creatinine came down to 0.9. So , it was likely that he was
slightly volume depleted on admission.
Cardiovascular: The patient had a history of angina but no recent
chest pain and no cardiac complaints. With his hematocrit of 18 ,
he had a flat CK and Troponin of 0.19 and had no further cardiac
issues during this hospital course. He was kept off aspirin given
his GI bleeding. THe patient also has hypertension and was on
Isordil and Cardizem for that. His blood pressure meds were held
initially on admission and were re-added back at the time of
discharge as well as his Mevacor.
Endocrine: The patient was maintained on his Humulin NPH and
covered with sliding scale during this admission. His blood sugars
remained in the 160 to 180 range.
Pulmonary: The patient was kept on his Albuterol and Azmacort
metered dose inhalers and by the time of discharge , was without
wheezes and satting well at 96% on room air.
Neuro: The patient was kept on his Klonopin and Paxil for anxiety.
Fluid , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient was started on
magnesium oxide for low magnesium during his hospital course.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Are as follows: 1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4
p.r.n. headache , 2. Isordil 20 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , 3. Cardizem 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , 4. Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q day ,

ATTENDING: LAZARO HINSHAW MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: CHF exacerbation.
LIST OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES:
1. CHF.
2. CAD status post CABG in 1988.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency.
4. Type II diabetes.
5. Glaucoma.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. History of bowel resection for diverticulitis.
8. Question of TIA in the past with right-sided numbness.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Elter is an 83-year-old Spanish-speaking female with history
of CAD , distant three-vessel CABG , CRI , NSTEMI in 10/29 ,
treated with just medications , EF of 75% in 10/29 , who
presented one week of PND , dyspnea on exertion , and chest
heaviness. This chest sensation did not radiate and was
unassociated with nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis or
lightheadedness. The patient also had cough with green sputum x1
year , no fevers or chills , no sick contacts. EMS gave Lasix and
Nitrospray. In the ED , she was briefly on a nonrebreather mask ,
responded to 80 mg of IV Lasix , K was 5.8 and got Kayexalate.
She became comfortable , sitting at 75 degrees , chest pain-free.
Also , noted no change in bowel/bladder habits , no change in meds
and no dietary changes. She had positive progressive lower
extremity edema x2 weeks.
ALLERGIES:
Lisinopril leading to hyperkalemia.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Retired textile worker from Ral , lives with daughter , and is
Spanish speaking.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
Aspirin , metoprolol , allopurinol , valsartan , glipizide , Lipitor ,
and nifedipine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Temperature was 96 , pulse was 70 , blood pressure was 148/56 ,
respiratory rate was 20 , and saturating 100% on nonrebreather and
eventually in the high 90s on a couple of liters of oxygen. In
general , she was in no acute distress , JVP 12 cm with positive
hepatojugular reflux , soft bibasilar rales , regular rate and
rhythm , 2-3/6 systolic murmur , loudest at the left upper sternal
border , ( mild AS on echo from 1/26 ). Abdomen was soft ,
nontender , and nondistended , bowel sounds positive. Extremities
showed 3+ bilateral pitting ankle edema with weak distal pulses.
LABORATORY DATA:
Showed a sodium of 129 , potassium of 5.7 , creatinine of 2.8 with
a baseline anywhere between 2 and 3.5 , cardiac enzymes negative
x1 , BNP of 1448. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 73 , septal
Qs , QTC of 456. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , small bilateral
effusions , no infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: Rule out MI by enzymes and EKG
with a full set negative. Continued her aspirin , beta-blockers ,
and statin for coronary artery disease. Pump: CHF flare with
elevated BNP , volume overload , diuresed with Lasix and Diuril;
salt/water restricted , kept strict I/O with moderate diuresis.
After load reduced with ARB , weaned off her previous home calcium
channel blocker. Rhythm: Telemetry showing transient new atrial
fibrillation with a maximum heart rate of less than 70 , which
spontaneously resolved after several hours. An echo showed
stable aortic stenosis without any acute worsening. She also had
a rhythm strip on the telemetry showing a regular focus of
ventricular ectopy , also spontaneously resolving. This was
treated with continued beta-blockers. At the time of discharge ,
she was in normal sinus rhythm.
2. Renal: Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine
of 2.8 to 3.3 , with acute worsening in-house , most likely
secondary to over diuresis with Diuril/Lasix , also some prerenal
component secondary to fluid restriction. Her potassium was
elevated initially , got Kayexalate , and then was low/low normal
after Lasix. Creatinine peaked at 4.1 , Lasix and ARBs were held.
Urine study showed a prerenal component , also showed some
proteinuria. Her creatinine eventually improved to 3.3 , and her
bicarb improved from 17 to 23 with the closing of her acid gap
from 17 to 11. Potassium was 4.5 at the time of discharge. The
patient will need to follow up with Dr. Dasgupta , her
nephrologist , and she was set up for an appointment on 2/18/04 .
3. Endocrine: DM-2 , she was treated with regular sliding scale
insulin with good blood sugar control. Her glipizide was held
given that her creatinine clearance was worsening. We did not
restart her glipizide at the time of discharge until follow up
with Dr. Ohlenbusch given her overall worsening creatinine
clearance.
4. Rheumatology: History of gout , change her allopurinol to
q.72h. from q.o.d. secondary to creatinine clearance. She did
complain of some left heel pain and left foot pain , thought
secondary to her gout. This improved at the time of discharge.
5. Heme: Hematocrit dropped from 29 to 25 , her guaiac was
negative on the 2/5/04 . She also has epistaxis at night for
four to five days. She was placed on humidified room air given
nasal saline sprays and Afrin. Because of her coronary artery
disease , she was transfused total of 3 units over the course of
her hospital stay to keep her hematocrit greater than 30. She
was given Lasix after her transfusions. An ENT evaluation showed
a small area of ulceration in her posterior nasopharynx , which
will need a follow up possibly with a CT as an outpatient to rule
out malignancy. At the time of her discharge , her hematocrit was
36. Initially , Coumadin was started given her new onset of
atrial fibrillation. After consideration of risks versus benefit
of anticoagulation , her transient atrial fibrillation which
resolved spontaneously , it was decided to continue any further
anticoagulation and send her out just on aspirin. She did
receive subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis while in-house.
GI: The patient initially had some constipation , which was
relieved with stool softeners. The patient's stool was guaiac
negative. The patient received the PPI.
DISPOSITION:
The daughter who is the patient's healthcare proxy was made aware
of the patient's status and disposition throughout her hospital
course. A PT evaluation indicated that the patient would benefit
from a period of re-stay at rehab , however the patient family
preferred the patient to go home and was constant that they would
be able to provide 24/7 support over the next week as the patient
will need help in navigating her home which included two flights
of stairs. PT was comfortable with this and this was explained
thoroughly to the patient and her family with regard to the risks
versus benefit of going home versus going to rehab. The patient
will follow up with Dr. Heingartner in one to two weeks , which has
not been scheduled , and with Dr. Tsunoda with Nephrology which
has been scheduled for 2/18/04 . Communication was made with Dr.
Smyth regarding her admission here. The patient will be sent
home with VNA support to follow up on her weights and fluid
status , she will also have home physical therapy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 72 year old woman with a
history of hypertension , non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus , high cholesterol , who presents with
chest pain. She is status post a coronary artery bypass grafting
in 1992 and catheterizations in 1993 and 1998 and has had a long
history of stable angina. This angina is approximately once per
week , always responds to one sublingual nitroglycerin. It is
usually diffuse pain in the front of her chest and across her back.
The morning of admission she experienced shortness of breath and
chest pain which decreased after one sublingual nitroglycerin.
After lunch she had a repeated episode which was not relieved by
nitroglycerin. She came to the emergency room at the Choharlbull Community Hospital .  Electrocardiogram there showed lateral changes.
The patient has been recently undergoing a work up for a weight
loss of 40-50 pounds over only a couple of months. An ERCP in
5/12 showed narrowing in the common bile duct. This narrow was
stented and brushings were taken. These brushings were sent for
cytology and pathological analysis and they were not diagnostic.
This course status post ERCP was complicated by pancreatitis.
Echocardiogram in 7/16/98 showed an ejection fraction of 40-45%
with 2+ mitral regurgitation. The most recent catheterization in
1998 showed the SVG to OM1 graft patent , the SVG to RCA graft
patent , LAD was totally occluded , the RCA was 40-50% occluded , PDA
had an ostial 80% lesion that was rotabladed. This was complicated
by a perforation. She had a short stay in the CCU after this
procedure.
ALLERGIES: Dilaudid which makes her dizzy.

HOSPITAL COURSE: She was admitted for rule out myocardial
infarction. She ruled out for the myocardial
infarction and had no further chest pain or electrocardiogram
changes. She had an exercise MIBI. On the exercise she went on a
modified Bruce for 6 minutes 25 seconds with a maximum heart rate
of 150. There were nondiagnostic ST changes during exercise and
she stopped due to fatigue. MIBI images showed the following:
There was a mixed transmural and nontransmural myocardial
infarction involving four cardiac segments in the inferior lateral
and lateral wall. There was moderate peri-infarct ischemia
involving additional segments. There was mild to moderate
ischemia involving three cardiac segments in the high lateral wall.
There was mild anterior septal ischemia. She went for cardiac
catheterization which showed the following: A right dominant
system with a left anterior descending that had lesions that were
40% and 50%. Diagonal had a 70% lesion that was stented to 20%.
Left circ was occluded with saphenous vein graft to the OM patent
and the saphenous vein graft to the RCA patent. There was in
addition a large 10 millimeter pseudoaneurysm at the site of the
previous PDA rotablation which was thrombosed with a coil. The
procedure was accomplished without complications. She had some

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Mr. Foller is a very pleasant 59 year-old man who
presents with a history of morbid obesity ,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ejection fraction of 40 percent
who presents status post a fall and with increasing urinary
frequency.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Neilsen has morbid obesity and is
currently at a weight of 450 pounds
and also has a history of fluctuating weight with decrease in
weight to 200 pounds with dieting. He also has obstructive sleep
apnea on continuous positive airway pressure , history of atrial

that time including B12 , ANA and HIV all of which were negative.
EMG showed decreased recruitment in the tibialis anterior and
gastrocnemius bilaterally. His rectus femoris were normal
bilaterally. He was treated for a urinary tract infection at that
time with Bactrim for resolution of his incontinence and he was not
anticoagulated by his primary care physician. Since discharge he
noted continued right greater than left lower extremity weakness
otherwise at baseline health until two weeks prior to admission
when he noted some lumbar and sacral pain , nonradiating , worse
while moving his right leg. Over the past few days he noted also
increasing urinary frequency without burning or urinary
incontinence , no fever or chills and no costovertebral angle
tenderness or pain. No bowel incontinence or perianal numbness or
pain. The night of admission , at 7:30 p.m. while getting up from a
chair , his right leg gave out and he fell to the floor ""gracefully""

CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: II/VI systolic
ejection murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. Irregular ,
irregular rhythm. No S3 or S4. ABDOMEN: Obese , soft and
nontender. ABDOMEN: Obese , soft and nontender. Nondistended with
positive bowel sounds and a significant rash of his pannus.
RECTAL: Strong rectal tone. EXTREMITIES: Right calf was with a
shallow , erythematous dry ulcer which was chronic with changes
consistent with venous insufficiency and varicose veins.
NEUROLOGICAL: Nonfocal. Strength in the right hip flexor was
decreased to 4/5 and on the right his plantar dorsiflexion strength
was 4/5 bilaterally. Sensation was grossly intact to touch.
Finger-to-nose was normal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , chloride
102 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 20 ,
creatinine 0.9 , glucose 101. He had a white blood cell count of 9
with 76 polys , 4 bands , hematocrit 37.6 and a platelet count of
236. His urinalysis showed 3+ blood and positive leukocyte
esterase with 15-20 white blood cells , one plus bacteria and one
plus squamous cells.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Neurological: The neurology service came by
to see the patient in the Emergency Room and felt
that there was no acute neurologic change but if the patient was
unable to walk he should be sent to rehabilitation. They saw no
new acute change and he should continue to be followed by neurology
in clinic.
2. Cardiac: He does have a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and echocardiogram with decreased ejection fraction
was noted previously. He will be started on a trial of Lasix p.o.
q day to decrease his peripheral edema to help him with
rehabilitation and his primary care physician will continue to
follow him for his atrial fibrillation and he does elect not to
anticoagulate him at the moment though Coumadin should be a
consideration given his risk of stroke.
3. Skin care: Right calf demonstrates a pressure ulcer and the
patient should apply Nystatin powder for his pannus rash.
4. Infectious disease: His urinary tract infection will be
treated with seven days of Bactrim and follow urine cultures.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient will be discharged to
rehabilitation care for leg
strengthening.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV. The patient was felt to be high risk for CAD on presentation
with her ESRD and DM. Will typical chest pain and a positive troponin
she was felt to have NSTEMI and was immediately placed on Reopro and
Heparin gtt , as well as nitro gtt for BP and pain control. She did well
overnight and went to hemodialysis and then directly to catheterization
the next morning. She was found to have a 70% LAD lesion which was
stented with a DES. She was started on ACEI , lipitor , ASA , plavix and
her oupatient lopressor was increased. She did well post-cath ,
complaining only of mild numbness/tingling in the lateral R thigh thought
to be a mild compression neuropathy from laying flat for hours post-cath.
Her groin was stable without hematoma and she had good peripheral
pulses. She was discharged to home to continue her cardiac medications
and follow-up with her cardiologist , Dr. Madaffari , and her PCP. Her BP was
well controlled and she had no rhythm issues throughout the
hospitalization.
2. ESRD. She was followed by the renal team throughout hospitalization
for hemodialysis and had no issues. Per the renal team she received
pre-cath mucomyst as she still makes some urine , and she was started on
lisinopril. She continued on nephrocaps. She will continue HD at
Paz General Hospital every MWF after discharge.
3. GOUT: She was continued on her outpatient allopurinol.
4. DM. She was continued on her outpatient insulin regimen with good
FSBG control.
5. COPD. She was continued on her outpatient atrovent with PRN
albuterol and she has oxygen at home.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your chest pain was caused by decreased flow to your heart muscle which
was corrected with a metal stent to keep the blood vessel in your heart
open. It is VERY important that you NEVER miss a day of your new
medication PLAVIX because this medication keeps that metal stent open.
Call Dr. Brownlie or Dr. Wendelberger if you have any chest pain , shortness of
breath or any other worrisome symptoms. Keep eating a heart-healthy
diet , gradually increase your exercise back to your baseline and take all
of your med

denies orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The patient's
risk factors for coronary artery disease include hypertension ,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and strong family history of
heart disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As stated above.
ALLERGIES: The patient has had a reaction to contrast dye in the
past that resulted in hives. THe patient has
questionable allergy to an unknown antibiotic which causes a rash.
The patient is also reportedly allergic to Bactrim.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a housekeeper originally from
Ponce Stertuc Mode She denies tobacco or alcohol use. The
patient lives with her son who is blind and also her granddaughter.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's father died of MI at age 81; mother
died of MI at age 73. The patient has a brother
who died of MI at age 38.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is comfortable in no acute
distress. It is noted that the patient is
morbidly obese. Vital signs; Pulse 120 , blood pressure 180/80 ,
temperature 99.5 , respiratory rate 16 , O2 sats 96% at room air.
HEENT: Pupils are equal , round and reactive to light; Extraocular
muscles are intact. Oropharynx is clear. Mucous membranes are
moist. NECK: Supple without lymphadenopathy. CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 ,
S2 no murmurs , rubs or gallops appreciated. The patient has
diminished dorsalis pedis pulse on the left side; otherwise ,
peripheral pulses are intact. CHEST: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally; crackles bilaterally at the bases. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
soft , non-tender. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis or edema
noted. There is a 1 cm abrasion at the right shin , bruising over
the right shin and dorsal aspect of the foot. NEURO: Alert and
oriented times three. There is a right lower facial droop;
otherwise cranial nerves II through XII intact. Motor is 5/5 in
all extremities; sensory is intact throughout to light touch.
LABORATORY: Sodium 138 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 100 , bicarb 26 ,
BUN 16 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 305. WBC 12.7 ,
hematocrit 36.1 , platelets 327. Troponin I is 0; CK 216. Chest
x-ray is negative. CT of head is negative. EKG shows normal sinus
rhythm at rate of 117. There is a right bundle branch block and
left anterior fascicular block present. There are also Q waves in
lateral leads V4 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the general medical
service for evaluation of syncope. She was
monitored over the weekend and no arrhythmias were picked up on
cardiac monitor. The patient underwent echocardiography which
showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of
80%. There were no wall motion abnormalities. There was also noted
mild left atrial enlargement and mild aortic valve sclerosis. Due
to the worrisome nature of patient's history of angina-like
symptoms , she went directly to cardiac catheterization , which
revealed heavily calcified LAD and RCA. The LAD showed proximal
stenosis of 30 to 40% , circumflex showed proximal stenosis of 30%
and the RCA showed proximal stenosis of 30%. It was felt that this
represented mild CAD and most likely could not explain the source
of the patient's syncopal episode. The patient also underwent
electrophysiology study which showed no evidence for ventricular
arrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias as cause of syncope. The patient
continued to have no arrhythmic events on cardiac monitor
throughout her hospital stay. The patient tolerated the cardiac
cath well and did well during the postprocedure period. The
patient's diltiazem was discontinued thinking that it may
contribute to heart block given the fact that she has a
bifascicular block. THe patient was started on nifedipine XL. The
patient was discharged home with close follow-up with her primary
care physician , Dr. Mendoca .

ALLERGIES: Patient with allergies to multiple medications
including aspirin , codeine , tetracycline , NSAIDs , ibuprofen ,
Benadryl , Compazine , penicillin. Additionally of note , patient
should not receive beta-blockage given history of cocaine abuse
and ongoing cocaine use.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient lives on the third floor of his
apartment building. Former tobacco user. Patient refused to
discuss polysubstance abuse at the time of admission.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
VITAL SIGNS ON ADMISSION: Patient was afebrile at 96 , pulse of
84 , blood pressure 150/99 , respiratory rate of 20 , O2 sat 100% on
room air. Patient was quite combative on admission , though it is
unclear exactly the etiology of the patient's agitation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for elevated
jugular venous pressure with pulsation observant the ear at 90
degrees , estimated approximately 18 cm of water. Patient
addition with rales approximately one-half to two-thirds up
bilaterally on chest exam. Cardiac exam: Patient regular rate
and rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops were appropriated.
Patient's lower extremities were felt to be warm and
well-perfused with 2+ lower extremity edema to the hips
bilaterally.
LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for sodium of 127 ,
hyponatremia felt to be secondary to chronic CHF exacerbation.
Potassium of 5.1 , bicarb of 19 , creatinine elevated at 2.6 up
from baseline of 1.8 , glucose elevated at 377 , hematocrit stable
at 34.5 and BNP was recorded on admission at greater than assay.
EKG on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate
of approximately
80 with T-wave inversion in V5-V6 which were similar to prior
echocardiograms. Chest x-ray obtained on admission revealed
pulmonary vascular congestion with flank pulmonary edema and
bilateral pleural effusions. No infiltrate was appreciated. As
such , patient was admitted for evaluation and management of CHF
exacerbation. CHF was felt to be secondary to medication and
dietary noncompliance as previously mentioned.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: Patient with no evidence for chest pain or
ischemic injury. At the time of admission , CHF exacerbation not
felt to be due to recurrent ischemia but rather medication
indiscretion. Of note , patient with multiple prior troponin
leaks ranging from 0.10 to 0.12 on prior admissions. Not felt to
be secondary to ischemia necessarily but rather due secondary to
elevated filling pressures.
B. Pump: Patient with decompensated heart failure on admission
not felt to be in a low cardiac output state but rather just
volume overloaded. Patient was subsequently diuresed using both
IV Lasix and p.o. torsemide. At the time of discharge , patient
felt to be relatively euvolemic though will likely require
further outpatient evaluation and ongoing diuresis given his
continued congestive heart failure. Patient with difficulty
adhering to a 2 liter per day fluid-restriction diet , would
recommend further nutritional outpatient evaluation and
counseling regarding his fluid status given poor cardiac
function. At the time of discharge , patient on 100 mg of
torsemide b.i.d. with relatively good urine output and I/O of
approximately negative 0.5 to 1 kg per day , would recommend
intensive outpatient CHF management including multidisciplinary
approach using heart failure nursing. Patient advised to use
scale and record daily weight , that there have been issues in the
past with compliance. Additionally , patient's Aldactone was
discontinued secondary to hyperkalemia and instead patient was
started on Isordil/hydralazine for hemodynamic support.
C. Rhythm: Patient stable from the perspective , maintained on
tele monitoring with no events over his hospital course.
2. Renal: Patient with acute renal failure on admission with
creatinine elevated to 2.6. With ongoing diuresis and correction
of volume overload , patient's creatinine corrected to a baseline
value. At the time of discharge , patient's creatinine was 2.0.
Recommend rehab monitoring of renal function including creatinine
and BUN every three days until patient on a stable dose of
torsemide and felt to be euvolemic , given concern or risk for
acute renal failure during ongoing diuresis.
3. Endocrine: Patient with a history of insulin-dependent
diabetes maintained on Lantus with Regular Insulin sliding scale
per outpatient regimen.
4. Psych: Patient with a history of bipolar disorder ,
maintained on Depakote. Additionally , patient with a history of
insomnia managed with Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.
Patient with a history of bipolar disorder treated with Depakote
per outpatient regimen.
MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: Include hydralazine 10 mg p.o.
q.i.d. with a hold parameter for systolic blood pressure less
than 100 mmHg. Regular Insulin sliding scale , Isordil 10 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , multivitamin , Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q.d. , torsemide 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. given aspirin allergy ,
Depakote ER 250 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. with
appropriate substitution for formulary PPI , Lantus
20 units SC q.h.s. P.r.n. medications to include Tylenol , Ativan
0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , Atrovent neb 0.5 mg neb
t.i.d. p.r.n. shortness of breath , Ultram 50 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n.
pain.
ONGOING MEDICAL ISSUES AND OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
1. Patient will require further aggressive outpatient CHF
management including ongoing diuresis using p.o. torsemide.
Patient does put out well to p.o. torsemide , though of note he
does have compliance issues with regards to daily fluid intake.
2. Additionally , would recommend further titration of
hydralazine and Isordil to maximize hemodynamic support.
3. Additionally , given hyperkalemia on admission with peak
potassium reaching 6.0 , patient's lisinopril and spironolactone
held at the time of discharge. Would recommend reinstitution of
patient's ACE inhibitor particularly as an outpatient with
low-dose lisinopril perhaps starting at 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. with
intensive monitoring of potassium.
4. Additionally , would recommend further diabetic teaching as an
outpatient given patient's poor compliance.
5. Strongly feel patient would benefit from involvement in a CHF
program either through Gon Ce or
through other program.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT: Patient to follow up with primary care
physician , Dr. Marion Salser , at the Pressou Healthcare Center .  Please call for follow-up appointment.

************** Hospital Course***************
1 ) ISCHEMIA: pt with prior CAD/stent , likely angina 2nd to demand
ischemia on decompenasted HF. cont meds , pt not on Plavix on
admission. Doubt primary angina as couse of CHF/RHF.
2 ) PUMP: Pt with ?dyastolic HF with
acute decomp/exacerbation ( with dietary
indiscretion )- as well as renal failure as poss source of
volume overload. Change to IV lasix 100 BID and
strict I/Os , weights. October Pt has responded to BMP diuresis in past.
Restarted here on BMP w/ limited response. Pt achieved -500 ml qd but
continued to have weight gain. I suspect that fluids were not being acc
urately accounted for. At this time patient is no longer being effect
ively diuresed and will require dialysis for volume overload in a
short period of time.
3 ) RHYTHM: No signs of arhtymias
4 ) RENAL: PT with stage 4 CRI and nephrotic
synd. May be volume overload 2nd to renal failure
in addition to CHF decomp/exacer. Cr. 4 at admission but elevated to
5.3. Given Pt's current condition , dialysis seems
imminent. October Pt went for vein mapping but pt remained uncertain if
he will accept dialysis as a treatment option. At time of d/c

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital on
2/14/04 and was taken to the OR the same day where he received
an aortic valve replacement using a 25 mm Carpentier Edwards
pericardial valve. He also received a 2-vessel CABG in which the
left internal mammary artery was grafted to the left anterior
descending artery and a saphenous vein was sewn to the first
obtuse marginal artery. Postoperatively , he was hemodynamically
stable and was taken to the cardiac intensive care unit. He was
quickly weaned off of the ventilator and was extubated. He was
then started on beta-blockade and on postoperative day 1 he was
transferred to the floor. Over the next few days , he was
diuresed. He later developed atrial fibrillation. He was
hemodynamically stable with this. However , his rate was in the
120s. Rate control was achieved using Diltiazem and Lopressor.
He was subsequently anticoagulated with Coumadin. On the day of
discharge , he remained alert and oriented , ambulating quite well
without assistance , hemodynamically stable with heart rate in the
70s. He was eating well and having a bowel movement and had been
diuresed quite well. He was felt to be fit for discharge and was
sent home in good condition. He will be seen by a visiting
nurse. Follow up will be initially with Dr. Maytubby who will
also manage his anticoagulation. He will see Dr. Roszales in four
to six weeks.

Discharge Date: 9/13/1995
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Unstable angina.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Brincefield is a 59 year old gentleman
with a history of coronary artery
disease , status post PTCA in 1990 who present with recurrent
uncontrolled chest pain. He had a positive exercise tolerance test
in October of 1990 which led to a catheterization which showed 100
% proximal right coronary artery and 60 % OMB-2. He had successful
PTCA of his right coronary artery. His chest pain recurred in
February of 1990 and he had another positive stress test ,
catheterization showed restenosis at the PTCA site and a second
PTCA was performed successfully. He has done well with negative
stress test , most recently in 6/7 .
Over the last several weeks to months , he has noted increasing
chest pain with less and less exertion and now presents with on and
off chest pain over the last 18 hours prior to admission. He was
treated in the Canter Memorial Hospital emergency room with beta
blockers and IV TNG which was limited by low blood pressure and
bradycardia. Because of ongoing chest pain with EKG changes , the
patient was taken directly to the cath lab and found to have a 70 %
left main , 80 % proximal LAD , 60 % OMB 2 , and minor irregularities
at the right coronary artery PTCA site.
Because of his continuing chest pain in the cath lab , an
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and the patient was
transferred to the CCU. His past medical history is significant
for coronary artery disease , hypertension , depression. He has no
past surgical history.
MEDICATIONS: His medications on admission include Diltiazem ,
Naprosyn , aspirin , Prozac.
ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is a white gentleman in moderate
distress. His heart rate is 54 , blood
pressure of 100/60 , jugular venous distention to 8 cm. with no
carotid bruits. Chest is clear to auscultation. The heart rate is
regular with a regular rhythm and no murmur. The abdomen is
benign. Neurologically , is grossly intact. His EKG on admission
shows sinus bradycardia with lateral ST and T wave abnormalities.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital and
underwent emergent catheterization as above
requiring an intra-aortic balloon pump and was then taken for
urgent surgery. On 7/28/95 , he was taken to the operating room
where he underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 utilizing
the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
coronary artery , and saphenous vein grafts to the obtuse marginal ,
ramus , under general endotracheal anesthesia and cardiopulmonary
bypass. This was performed by Dr. Gondek and there were no
complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well. He was
taken to the post surgical intensive care unit in stable condition.
He remained hemodynamically stable over the first postoperative
night and was extubated without any problem. His intra-aortic
balloon pump was weaned down as tolerated and removed at the bed
side. He was started on Lopressor and aspirin and continued on
Ancef perioperatively. He was given Lasix for diuresis and
responded well. He progressed well and had his chest tubes removed
and was ambulating and tolerating a regular diet well. By
postoperative day five , a moderate amount of tan drainage was
noticed at the lower portion of his sternal wound. The sternum was
only slightly unstable and the wires all appeared intact on chest
x-ray. He was started no Vancomycin. By postoperative day seven ,
he continued to be afebrile and hemodynamically stable , saturating
at 95 % on room air. His sternal wound remained clean and he was
discharged home to be followed up by VNA with dressing changes and
monitored closely.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Include enteric coated aspirin once a
day , Prozac twice a day , Lopressor 25 mg.
bid , Tylox one to two capsules q three to four hours prn pain ,

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 60 year old , black male
who initially presented for an injured
knee , which occurred three days ago at work. He was noted in
triage to have a blood pressure of 210/130 and was triaged to
urgent. The patient has had a long-standing history of
hypertension and he stopped his medications actually about two
months ago when he ran out of prescriptions. Following this the
patient began to note some difficulty with dyspnea on exertion and
has also noted some altered sensations in his chest during the week
prior to admission , which lasted approximately one to two seconds
and occurred primarily at rest. These occurred across his chest
but did not radiate. The patient stated his shortness of breath
has become progressively worse. He has had no orthopnea.
Basically , over the past three weeks the patient has noted ( 1 ) his
irregular heart beat , as if he is missing beats , although he does
not note any tachycardia , ( 2 ) dyspnea on exertion , including
orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and ( 3 ) intermittent
substernal chest pain which occurs only at rest and not with
exertion. He described this as an ache and stated it did not
radiate. The episodes lasted , at the most , four to five minutes ,
and resolved on their own without any other symptoms. He denies
any syncope or presyncope. Four years ago , as mentioned , he
slipped at work , bending his right leg , and has subsequently had
increased swelling of his right knee , foot and calf , also with some
calf pain. Today was a holiday and he had off from work , so he
came to the Emergency Ward , primarily for evaluation of his knee
and his dyspnea. At that time they found that he was in atrial
flutter.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history includes
hypertension , LVH , asthma , increased
cholesterol , borderline diabetes mellitus , obesity , gastritis ,
allergic rhinitis , depression , osteoarthritis , chronic right knee
effusion , and impotence , status post penile implant.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: His medications include Procardia XL
60 mg q day , Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q
day , Mevacor 40 mg q day , Ventolin and Beconase inhalers , Seldane
p.r.n. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. , Elavil 25 mg h.s. , and Paxil 20 mg q
day. He has not taken these in the past two months.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and lives with his wife. He is a
bulldozer operator. He does not smoke , drink or
use any drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is negative for coronary artery
disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His physical examination showed a black
male in no acute distress. His pressure at
the time of admission examination was 170/100. His heart rate was
in the 50 to 80 range. Respirations were 16. Temperature was
98.7. He was satting 98 percent on room air. Heent was benign.
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy. The lungs had some
bibasilar crackles and slight wheezes on the left. The heart was
irregularly irregular with an S1 , S2 and S4. There were no
murmurs. The abdomen had normal bowel sounds and was soft , mildly
obese and non-tender. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal was
heme negative per Emergency Ward. Extremities showed 1+ right
edema and some trace , left sided , lower extremity edema. Right
knee was very swollen and he had right calf tenderness but no cord.
On neurological examination he was alert and oriented times three.
Examination was non-focal.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs showed a sodium of 142 , potassium 4.4 ,
chloride of 102 , bicarbonate of 26 , BUN 14 ,
creatinine 1.1 , and blood glucose was 122. Magnesium was 1.6. CK
was 385 and MB was 2.9. White cell count was 7.8 , hematocrit 43.7 ,
and platelets were 234 , 000. His PT was 12.7 , PTT 24.4. Chest
x-ray showed increased cardiac silhouette , PVR , and there were no
infiltrates. The knee film showed a large effusion , which was
present in the past , and some osteoarthritis but no sign of
fracture. The patient had lower extremity non invasives which were
negative and a VQ scan which was read as between low and
intermediate probability.
ASSESSMENT: This is a 60 year old man with long-standing
hypertension , now off medications for two months. He
presented with new atrial fibrillation , mild congestive heart
failure and intermittent atypical chest pain. Given symptoms were
predated by a leg injury , his lower extremity non invasives were
negative and VQ scan was low to intermediate probability , the
possibility of pulmonary embolism was not further pursued. Likely
mechanism is poorly controlled hypertension and conduction system
disease causing atrial flutter and congestive heart failure. His
low rate is worrisome for intrinsic conduction disease and it was
considered that there was no need for anticoagulation for atrial
flutter.
HOSPITAL COURSE: As noted , the patient had lower extremity non
invasives and VQ scans which were essentially
negative and he was not treated for pulmonary embolism , as it was
considered to be ruled out. He had an echocardiogram during his
admission which showed 50 percent ejection fraction with inferior
hypokinesis and left atrial size of 4 cm. The patient remained in
atrial flutter during his admission and was coumadinized for the
concern he may be slipping from atrial flutter to atrial
fibrillation occasionally. He was also started on Digoxin. The
patient remained stable and did well. He ruled out for myocardial
infarction. He was then discharged for follow up with Dr.
Gulbraa for his general medical concerns and will have an
appointment with Dr. Linegar for cardioversion and an exercise
tolerance test. The patient's Dig levels and PT will be checked as
an outpatient by the VNA services and these will also be called to
Dr. Beckler . The patient's admission was without complication.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: The patient's discharge medications
and dosing were Ventolin two puffs
q.i.d. p.r.n. shortness of breath , Ecasa 325 mg p.o. q day , Digoxin
0.25 mg p.o. q day , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q day , Lisinopril 30 mg p.o.
q day , Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , naproxen 325 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient's condition on
discharge was stable. Disposition was to home with
services. DISABILITY: Estimated disability was mild.

murmur at the right upper sternal border consistent with her
diagnosis of aortic stenosis/sclerosis. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender.
Left greater than right 1+ pitting edema to the ankles.
LABORATORY STUDIES: Chemistries notable for creatinine of 1.7 ,
BUN 34 , hematocrit 48.1 , CK flat at 33 ,
troponin 0.02. Chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions and
pulmonary edema. ECG compared with April 2001 showed no
ischemic changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient was given
increasing doses of Lopressor for rate control of
her atrial fibrillation up to 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. On 2/6/02 the
patient was found with a heart rate in the 30s. It was then
decreased to the 20s and the patient was presyncopal. A code blue
was called. The patient was treated with atropine and
transthoracic pacing and Dopamine for hypotension. The patient was
intubated for airway protection. She weaned slowly off the vent in
the cardiac care unit , was extubated on 9/14/02 and transferred to
the floor on 3/20/02 . On the floor the patient was convalescing ,
diuresing with Lasix 40 mg IV p.r.n. for a goal of 500-1 , 000 cc
negative each day. This IV dose was changed to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
The patient's Captopril was titrated up as her blood pressure
tolerated and this was changed to zestril 40 mg before discharge.
The patient continued on amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.day , which was
changed to 300 mg p.o. q.day on discharge. The patient remained in
sinus rhythm with a heart rate ranging from 48 to the high 60s.
The patient was not symptomatic with this relative bradycardia but
it was noted that in the future if this persists , a pacemaker
should be considered.
PULMONARY: The patient had fever and hypoxia in the cardiac care
unit. Sputum was cultured and grew pansensitive pneumococcus. The
patient was started on ampicillin which was changed to amoxicillin
on day seven of antibiotics. The patient was also placed
temporarily on albuterol and Atrovent nebs which were discontinued
on 11/28/02 .
FEN/GI: The patient had a mild hypernatremia up to 152 and
contraction on glyc improved with regard to correcting her
intravascular volume status. She was maintained on low salt diet
and lytes were repleted p.r.n. The patient was kept on regular NPH
doses with CZI sliding scale p.r.n. Although morning sugars ranged
in the 60-70s , afternoon glucoses were often in the mid 200s. Mrs.
Acevedo primary care physician may want to consider adding a
midday dose of regular insulin.
DERMATOLOGY: The patient had palmar and plantar lesions diagnosed
by dermatology as palmoplantar keratoderma that was treated with
miconazole.
Physical therapy was consulted and gave recommendations about
oxygen use at home as well as use of a walker and home safety.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with VNA
services and home oxygen in place through the MHAC
care coordination.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone 300 mg p.o. q.day , amoxicillin
875 mg p.o. b.i.d. x6 days , buffered
aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.day , Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin NPH 42
units subcu q.a.m. , 8 units subcu q.p.m. , zestril 40 mg p.o. q.day ,

IMPRESSION: Ms. Denna is a 58F with a h/o diabetes , CAD s/p stent to
LAD in 2004 , permanent pacemaker for ?afib/SSS , who was admitted with
chest pain that she described as exactly like her MI w/ ckmb elevated.
However she also stated that her chest pain had never really resolved
after her cath in 2004. Complicating factors include multiple admissions
for chest pain , chronic pain syndrome , and narcotic dependence.
**CV: i: Initially there was concern b/c her CKMB fraction was
elevated , and there were T wave inversions in V3-V6 that seemed new in a
non-paced EKG that was captured. She received one dose of therapeutic
lovenox , which was discontinued when she ruled out. She continued to
complain of chest pain throughout her admission , which typically would be
relieved by morphine. Suspicion for cardiac chest pain is low , but a
MIBI was obtained to determine her baseline. The MIBI
revealed normal perfusion and normal EF. There was abnormal uptake in the
left axilla , and obtaining a mammogram was recommended.
**NEURO: High pain med requirements secondary to chronic pain , and
surgical interventions. She was maintained on regimen as outlined in
last d/c summary , including MS Contin 30mg BID and oxycodone 30mg po q4h
prn pain. Pain service was called but did not see her in house and
recommended outpatient follow up with either rheumatology or psychiatry
re her chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia. Bladder training can be
considered given her urinary incontinence.
**ORTHO: recent procedure ( 10/24 L3-L5 laminectomy for cauda equina ,
I&D for seroma 7/8 .  Orthopedics followed while she was in house. She
was noted to have a small protrusion likely muscle herniation in the site
of the recent procedure. Dr. Loendorf ID saw the patient and will see
her in follow up. She is to continue the vancomycin through 6/25/07 , and
then the vancomycin and the PICC should be discontinued. She will follow up
with Dr. Dininger on July .

Discharge Date: 4/5/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CARDIOMYOPATHY.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. Coronary artery disease. 2.
Hyperlipidemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 50 year old gentleman
with a history of CAD dating back to
1991 when the cath showed one vessel disease. He was not
angioplastied. The patient had an MI at that time which was
medically managed. The patient did well until July of 1995 when
the patient had another anterior MI , massive , treated with
thrombolytics. Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed a 99%
proximal RCA and serial 70% LAD lesions. The patient also was
noted to have a severe LV dysfunction with an ejection fraction of
28% and his MI was complicated by a complete heart block and a dual
chamber pacemaker was placed. At that time the patient was
considered to be a surgical candidate secondary to high risk. In
August of 1995 the patient was admitted for non Q wave MI with a
peak CK of 798 , positive MB fraction , and was again treated with
thrombolysis with TPA. The patient did well with no anginal
symptoms but has had primarily symptoms of CHF with dyspnea upon
exertion , progressive shortness of breath , and limited exercise
tolerance since that time. In July of 1996 the patient had an
exercise tolerance test with oxygen consumption measured at 11.8
ml/kg. The patient exercised for 6 minutes and reached a maximal
heart rate of 114 and stopped secondary to dyspnea. Given the
patient's poor functional status he presented for cardiac
catheterization and complete workup for cardiac transplant. The
patient admits no shortness of breath at rest but with 1-2 flights
of steps. He also becomes short of breath with ten minutes of
light labor. The patient also has daily angina with neck pain
radiating to his head which is relieved with rest.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. CAD , as above status post MI times three
in 1991 and 1995 twice. 2. CHF , ischemic
cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 28% since July of 1995.
3. Hyperlipidemia with a cholesterol in the 300s.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for coronary artery disease paternal
uncle , died at that age of 39 of an MI. Sister
died at the age of 66 of an MI. Brother had an MI at the age of
55. Positive for diabetes mellitus in a paternal uncle. Positive
for hypertension in his mother. Father died of emphysema.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Positive for tobacco , four packs per day times 20
years , quit in 1991. Ethanol , one glass of wine
per day , quit in 1995. Married times 27 years , three children ages
21 to 25. Retired merchandise wholesaler , currently on disability.

Guaiac negative. Prostate no nodules.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium of 145 , potassium 4.9 , chloride
102 , bicarb 28 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.5 ,
glucose of 90. Calcium of 9.9 , phosphorus 3.4 , cholesterol 178 ,
triglycerides 129. Hematocrit 54 , white count of 5.5 , platelet
count of 188 , 000. PT 1.3 , PTT of 30.5. LFTs: AST 54 , ALT 39.
EKG showed a left bundle branch block with Q waves in V1 and V3 ,
biatrial enlargement , inverted T waves in II , III , and AVF. Chest
x-ray revealed cardiomegaly , DDD pacer wires in position , lungs
clear.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted originally for a workup
for cardiac transplant. The patient had a
cardiac transplant labs drawn , had a PPD placed , which was negative
with positive controls. The patient had a psychiatry consult.
Hepatitis serology for hepatitis B and C were negative. The
patient was kept on heparin at therapeutic levels and was diuresed
with Lasix. His Captopril was also increased. The patient was
also treated with Isordil. At this point the patient was
reassessed and it was thought that he might be a candidate for a
revascularization. With this in mind , the patient was scheduled
for a ETT Thallium which if positive for ischemia he would go for a
cardiac catheterization. In the meantime the patient was medically
managed , diuresed of three to four liters over the several days of
admission. His Isordil was increased and he was continued on aspirin and
digoxin , on Mevacor. Further transplant labs revealed a TSH of
2.8 , T3 of 159 , T4 of 7.8. Urine 24 hour collection total volume
was 4200 cc , creatinine of 29 , urine protein less than assay. The
patient had his ETT Thallium which showed a question of septal
ischemia with a fixed apical defect. The patient went 6 minutes on
a standard Bruce protocol with a maximum heart rate of 156 , stopped
secondary to chest pain and 1 mm ST segment depressions. The
patient went to cardiac catheterization the following day. The
patient's cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel disease
with a 100% LAD. His catheterization film was evaluated by cardiac
surgery , Dr. Wolinski who believed that the patient would not benefit
from a CABG. Given this , the patient received a continued
transplant workup of a CT of the abdomen , as well as a dental
consult , with a planned tooth extraction , with appropriate
premedication with amoxicillin , and holding of his heparin. The
patient tolerated this well. Preliminary report on the CT of the
abdomen showed a small single less than 1 cm hepatic lesion. The
patient was medically stable on discharge.
The patient was found to have increasing LFT's upon discharge. Subsequently ,
his mevacor was dicontinued and LFT's returned to norma. DISCHARGE
MEDICATIONS: Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.day , Lasix
80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q.day
( Discontinued immediately after discharge ) , Coumadin to be taken for 5 mg
q.h.s. for four days and then to resume the 2.5 mg
with 5 mg q.o.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with the Cardiomyopathy
Service. The patient will be followed up to see how he
is tolerating his new medical regimen and be further evaluated for
cardiac transplant.

Discharge Date: 6/22/1994
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE: 1. ASTHMA.
2. MORBID OBESITY.
3. ALCOHOL ABUSE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Zukowsky is a 50 year old woman with a
long history of asthma who presented
with shortness of breath and palpitations. Her asthma is
characterized by multiple short admissions for flares , last in
October 1993 , and multiple courses of steroid tapers. At home , she
uses Ventolin and Theophylline. Her other medical problems include
morbid obesity and a history of alcohol abuse. She has had
palpitations in the past and a Holter in 4/19 showed only three
episodes of supraventricular tachycardia. She has also had a
stress test in February 1992 which was a nine minute arm cycle
stress test with maximal heart rate of 128 and systolic blood
pressure of 120. The test was negative for ischemic changes. She
has never had an EKG showing atrial fibrillation. She came into
the Emergency Ward on 8/22/94 complaining of two weeks of
intermittent palpitations as well as shortness of breath. She used
increased doses of her Ventolin inhaler for this and continued on
her Theophylline. She felt her heart fluttering quite a bit and
intermittently , these palpitations would go away. She never took
her heart rate during these episodes nor could she characterize her
heart as being irregular. Prior to the palpitations beginning , she
had gone on a drinking binge and had drank a half a pint of brandy.
She has had a cough productive of whitish sputum but no change in
the sputum character chronically. Her asthma has been slightly
increasing with increased wheezing and she has been using her
inhaler more. In the Emergency Ward , her EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with a heart rate in the 130 range. She was
controlled with intravenous Diltiazem and admitted for new onset
atrial fibrillation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above and also
including degenerative joint disease of the knees and ankles.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Slo-phyllin and Ventolin Inhaler. ALLERGIES:
She had no known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with
her two children , has used alcohol in binges , and does not smoke.
FAMILY HISTORY: She has a family history of coronary artery
disease with a mother who died of a myocardial infarction in her
fifties.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a morbidly obese black female in no
acute distress. Her temperature was 98.2 ,
heart rate 108 , blood pressure 110/68 , and O2 saturations 96% on
two liters. HEAD/NECK: Examinations were negative , her jugular
venous pressure was not visible secondary to obesity , and her
carotids were 1+ bilaterally. LUNGS: Showed scant wheezing at the
left base otherwise were clear. CARDIAC: Examination was
irregularly irregular , she had distant S1 and S2 , and no murmurs.
ABDOMEN: Obese , soft , non-tender , and no organomegaly.
EXTREMITIES: Without definite edema. RECTAL: Examination was OB
negative with decreased tone. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was
essentially non-focal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Notable on admission were a theophylline
level of 23.6 which was elevated , an SMA 7
which was within normal limits with the exception of a potassium of
3.8 , BUN and creatinine of 5 and 0.9 , and CBC showed a white count
of 6.1 , hematocrit 40.8 , and platelets of 288. An EKG showed
atrial fibrillation at 136 with low voltage and poor R wave
progression. Chest X-Ray showed no infiltrates or effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Service.
Her rate was controlled with intravenous
Diltiazem drip which was changed over to 90 mg p.o. q.d. In
addition , she was started on Digoxin and her rate was controlled to
the seventies and eighties. She was also heparinized and
coumadinized and an ACE consultation was obtained given her history
of alcohol abuse. She was not interested in further out-patient
care for this matter but has the number and will call if she
desires it. Also , a Nutrition consultation was obtained given her
obesity and she will follow-up with them as an out-patient.
DISPOSITION: She is followed in WHITELA TANRAL HOSPITAL Clinic by Dr. Douglass Plane
and he will see her as an out-patient in one week at
which time he will schedule her an admission for elective
cardioversion after she has been anti-coagulated for at least three
weeks. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Diltiazem
SR 180 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Beclovent Inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d. ,
Atrovent Inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d. , and Nitroglycerin

Sensation and reflexes symmetric and equal. Pulses 2+
bilaterally at carotids , radials , femorals and PTs , present by
Doppler at DPs bilaterally. Allen's test of the left and right
upper extremities both normal.
PREOPERATIVE LABS: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 101 ,
bicarb 29 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 298. White blood cell
count 6.0 , hematocrit 42.9 , hemoglobin 13.8 , platelets 237 , 000 ,
PT 15.9 , INR 1.3 , PTT 29.6. Urinalysis was normal.
CAROTID IMAGING: The patient had less than 25% stenosis of the
right internal and left internal carotid arteries. MR angiogram
of the left internal carotid artery showed 60% occlusion and 50%
occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac
catheterization performed on 4/7/06 at Kan Hospital revealed 100% ostial LAD stenosis , 100% proximal
circumflex stenosis , 70% ostial left main stenosis , 75% mid RCA
stenosis , 50% proximal RT LV-BR stenosis , and proximal stenosis of the
right PDA. CABG grafts from prior bypass surgery were all
patent.
Echocardiogram on 6/5/06 showed an ejection fraction of 60% ,
aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 38 mmHg and peak gradient
of 67 mmHg , calculated valve area was estimated at 0.7 sq cm.
There was mild mitral valve insufficiency. An EKG on 5/27/06
showed first-degree AV block with a heart rate of 62 and inverted
T waves in leads I , aVL and V4 through V6.
Chest x-ray on 7/6/06 was consistent with congestive heart
failure and revealed aortic calcifications and left lower lobe
atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 7/6/06 for
completion of his preoperative workup. He was brought to the
operating room on 10/22/06 where Dr. Luangrath performed a reoperative
sternotomy and a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement
using a 23-mm Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve. The
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 186 minutes and the aortic
cross-clamp time was 77 minutes. The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery
Intensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. Over
the next few days , the patient was extubated. He had episodes of
uncontrolled hypertension and was placed on a nitroglycerin drip.
By postoperative day #4 , the patient had been weaned off his
drips and his blood pressure was well controlled. He had been
hemodynamically stable and afebrile in the Intensive Care Unit.
He was ready for transfer to the regular hospital floor for the
remainder of his recovery. At that point , the patient demonstrated
postoperative confusion , particularly at night. The
patient's neurological exam was otherwise normal. The patient
was started on cardiac medications including captopril , Lopressor
and aspirin. He had been extubated without complication and was
oxygenating well with the support of 1 liter of oxygen via nasal
cannula. He had no respiratory issues. The patient was seen by
the Speech and Swallow Service for his history of dysphagia and
was cleared for mechanical soft diet with nectar-thick liquids
and crushed pills. The patient's diet was advanced as tolerated.
He exhibited adequate urine output with diuretics
postoperatively for fluid retention. The patient was followed by
the Diabetes Management Service in the postoperative period for
his history of diabetes. He was initially on an insulin drip and
then weaned to a NovoLog sliding scale with supplemental Lantus
insulin in the evenings. The patient's hematocrit had dropped to
22 on postoperative operative day #3 and he was transfused one
unit of packed red blood cells with an appropriate hematocrit
bumped to 26. On postoperative days #4 through #6 , the patient
continued his slow steady progress. The neurology team who had
visited him after surgery after his mental status changes
recommended holding his Sinemet and only to restart if his
Parkinson symptoms reoccur. Otherwise , the patient
experienced some hypertension and his blood pressure medications
were titrated accordingly. The patient remained in a sinus
rhythm. By postoperative day #6 , his blood pressure was stable.
He was oxygenating well on room air and was ambulating
comfortably in the halls. He had a sitter accompany him in his
room for impulsivity , however , this became unnecessary after
postoperative day #6. A PA and lateral chest x-ray looked clear
with no infiltrates and no pneumothorax. He had returned to his
baseline mental status and he was deemed ready for discharge to
the rehabilitation facility , which is owned by his daughter.
On the day of discharge , the patient's vital signs were
temperature 97.7 degrees , heart rate 65 in sinus rhythm , blood
pressure 104/60 , O2 saturation 97% on room air. Respiratory rate
20. The patient was still several kilograms above his
preoperative weight. A urinalysis had suggested a low-level
infection and his urine culture was growing proteus 5000 CFUs and
he was started on a seven day course of ciprofloxacin.
LABORATORY DATA: On the day of discharge , sodium 143 , potassium
4.2 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 34 , BUN 33 , creatinine 1.2 ,
glucose 102 , magnesium 2.4 , white blood cell count 11.6 ,

and chest pain. The patient was found to have critical aortic
stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 cm2 an EF of 60%. The patient
does have a history of positive stress test for which a cardiac
catheterization was performed in 6/29 .  At that time , he was
found to have 40% lesion of the LAD. On admission to the
Nides Medical Center , on 10/12/05 , cardiac enzymes were drawn and this showed
a troponin level of 0.21. EKG showed no acute changes. The
patient was placed ACS protocol and initially admitted to the
Cardiology Service. The Cardiac Surgery Service was consulted
for emergent aortic valve repair and potential coronary artery
bypass grafting.

Admission labs are significant for BUN of 49 , creatinine of 2.8 ,
glucose of 203 , white blood cell count of 9660 , hematocrit of
35% , and platelets 269 , 000.
IMAGING:
1. Cardiac catheterization on 1/11/04 performed at Sonprat Health , 40%
proximal LAD lesion , codominant circulation.
2. Echocardiogram on 5/13 , aortic stenosis with mean gradient
62 mmHg , peak gradient of 82 mmHg , calculated valve area 0.7 cm2 ,
mild aortic insufficiency , trivial mitral insufficiency , LVH EF
of 50%.
3. EKG on 10/21/05 , normal sinus rhythm at 70 with first-degree
AV block , evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.
4. Chest x-ray on 10/21/05 , interstitial pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
On 10/17/05 , the patient was brought to the operating room for
critical aortic stenosis , acute coronary syndrome and acute
pulmonary edema. He underwent an aortic valve replacement with a
#21 Carpentier-Edwards magna valve , as well as a coronary artery
bypass graft x1 with LIMA to LAD. Bypass time was 120 minutes
and crossclamp time 90 minutes. Two atrial wires and one
ventricular wire was placed. Please see the operative note for
further details. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He
was extubated with without incident on postoperative day #1. His
neurologic status was in time and he did not suffer any delirium
as witnessed after his initial emergence from anesthesia during
the renal transplantation. He was noted to have significant oral
secretions , but these were clear and thin. On postoperative day
#1 , his femoral arterial line was removed and his renal
transplantation medications restarted. His CK-MB peaked at 46
and did trend down thereafter. On postoperative day #2 , he had
begun to be diuresed in light persistent pulmonary edema and seen
by chest x-ray. His chest tubes were removed without incident.
On postoperative day #3 , he was hemodynamically stable. His FK
levels were noted to be low , as is historically the case with
him. Renal Transplant Medicine was following and did titrated
his medications as necessary. On postoperative day #4 , his final
left chest tube was removed. Post-pull chest x-ray showed the
lung to be well expanded. He was found to be hyponatremic with a
sodium of approximately 130. He was begun on fluid restriction
of 1.5 liters for hematocrit of 21. A 1 unit of packed red blood
cells was also given at this time and he was continued on
diuresis. On postoperative day #5 , as his preoperatively weight
had been reached , he was taken off of diuresis. His renal
transplantation medications discontinue. The patient was up out
of bed and ambulating well. The patient was also noted to have a
large sacral decubitus ulcer , without exposure of bone. This
ulcer was the result of the previous admission in January after
renal transplantation. The Plastic Surgery Service was consulted
and their recommendations included appropriate therapeutic
support surface , frequent turning with minimization of being in
the seated position , optimization of nutrition , and wet-to-dry
dressings to the wound. The service is still following the
patient and will consider VAC dressing and the later time.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEMS:
Neuro: The patient was alert , oriented , and intact. P.r.n.
narcotic pain medications as tolerated. Please avoid NSAIDs and
nephrotoxic drugs for pain control.
Cardiovascular: Lopressor increased to 37.5 mg p.o. q.i.d.. To
be titrated to goal systolic blood pressure of less than 140 and
heart rate in the 70's. Diltiazem , currently on hold , per Dr.
Grat . Renal Transplant Medicine is aware and in an agreement.
Respiratory: The patient is saturating well on room air. Chest
x-ray with mild pulmonary edema , improving each day. Continue
pulmonary toilet and activity.
GI: On cardiac/renal/ADA diet. Nexium , continued to offer
nutritional supplementation to optimize status in light of wound
healing needs.
Renal: Status post renal transplantation in 5/13 with Renal

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Urosepsis.
LIST OF PROBLEMS:
1. Urosepsis.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure.
3. Pneumonia.
4. Aspiration.
5. Pulmonary embolism.
6. Diabetes.
7. Obstructive sleep apnea.
8. Spinal sarcoidosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of spinal
sarcoidosis with secondary paraplegia who presented with altered
mental status , hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. He
was doing well until the morning of 4/29/2006 when he complained
of difficulty breathing and his wife placed him on home CPAP
machine that he usually uses at night. Despite being placed on
the machine , he was still having air hunger and complaining of
feeling unwell. His wife also noted him to have increasing
lethargy and decreased responsiveness and called EMS to have him
brought to the emergency room. He also was noted to have a
decreased urine output from his chronic suprapubic catheter x2
days. In the emergency room , he was found to be unresponsive ,
grunting , and in respiratory distress. His initial room air
saturation was in the high 60's to low 70's. He was placed on
100% nonrebreather with some improvement of his saturations in
the low 90's and an ABG of 7.37/43/77 on 100% nonrebreather. He
was therefore intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. He
became hypotensive with intubation despite using etomidate with
blood pressures in the 60's/40's , and an initial CVP of 16 , so he
was started on Levophed with a systolic blood pressure in the
130's on 7 to 10 of Levophed. He received 1 liter of IV fluid.
He received a head CT without contrast that showed no acute
bleeding or acute infarction. He had a chest x-ray that showed
no obvious infiltrate. His INR was found to be elevated. Given
the CT of his abdomen without contrast that showed a suprapubic
catheter obstruction with bilateral hydronephrosis and distended
bladder. His creatinine was 2.9 , elevated from his baseline of
0.9. Urology was consulted to change the suprapubic catheter
tube and pus was noted to be aspirated from the suprapubic
catheter. He was started on vancomycin , gentamicin , Flagyl , and
stress dose steroids , and blood and urine cultures were sent in
the emergency and he was transferred to the MICU.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Sarcoid disease 20 years ago , paraplegia x18 years , chronic
suprapubic catheter/ostomy for 12 years , diabetes type II , right
DVT , on Coumadin , status post chronic UTI , and CPAP at night for

His temperature was 97.4 , heart rate 105 , blood pressure 136/67 ,
his O2 saturation was 100% on AC 700 with PEEP of 5. In general ,
he was intubated and responsive to simple commands. HEENT:
Sluggish pupils. His lungs were clear anteriorly. His heart was
in regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. His
abdomen was obese , large , soft , nondistended and nontender , with
positive bowel sounds. His extremities had chronic venous stasis
changes of right and lower extremities with areas of no skin
breakdown. He had a large sacral decubitus ulcer with bone
exposed that was foul smelling on his sacrum. He was
neurologically moving all four extremities and following
commands. He had an ostomy and suprapubic catheter in place.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
Notable for an elevated creatinine of 2.9 , otherwise , his Chem-7
was within normal limits. His LFTs were within normal limits.
His hematocrit was 34.6 , his white count was 9.4 , and his
platelets were 343 , 000. He had negative cardiac enzymes. His
urine and blood tox screens were negative. His UA was
significant for 3+ protein , trace glucose , negative ketones , 3+
leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 4-10 red blood cells , 4+
bacteria , and 3+ triple phosphate crystals. His EKG was in
normal sinus rhythm with an old right bundle-branch block and
left axis deviation , first-degree AV block. His chest x-ray
showed retrocardiac opacity that was thought to be aspiration
versus pneumonia. Abdominal and chest CT showed bibasilar
airspace opacities , left greater than right , with aspiration
versus pneumonia , bilateral hydronephrosis , severe decubitus
ulcers , and large gastrohepatic lymph nodes slightly enlarged and
calcified.
ASSESSMENT:
This is a 66-year-old man with spinal sarcoidosis and secondary
paraplegia , who presented with altered mental status , hypoxemic
respiratory failure , and hypotension , who had urosepsis and
pneumonia and found later on admission to have pulmonary
embolism.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Hypoxemia: He was intubated at the time of admission and
extubated a day later on 5/7/2006. BiPAP was used at night as
he had used at home for a sleep apnea with O2 saturations in the
high 90's on room air during the day. He was initially treated
for pneumonia with ceftazidime , levofloxacin , and vancomycin.
The vancomycin was discontinued on 3/18/2006 , and the
ceftazidime was discontinued on 10/8/206. His levofloxacin was
continued at 500 mg per day for a total 10-day course on
5/3/2006. This is to be used for a UTI and pneumonia. On
11/8/2006 , the patient was supposed to go home and found to have
a desaturation to high 80's on room air. He was found to have a
chest x-ray within normal limits. A pulmonary embolism CT was
done that demonstrated a small nonocclusive pulmonary embolism in
the posterobasilar segment of the right lower lobe with involving
right lower lobe infarct suggestive that he had had a PE that was
resolving. At this time , his INR had been subtherapeutic for
three days at 1.7 to 1.9 and he was continued on his Coumadin.
The following day , his INR was therapeutic at 2 , and on the day
of discharge , it was 2.2. It was thought that the PE was in the
setting of a subtherapeutic INR. His oxygen requirement was back
to baseline at the time of discharge , and his goal INR was to be
on the higher end of the 2 to 3 range , which was goal previously.
He was also given nebulizer treatments throughout his
hospitalization.
2. ID: His urine was found to have Proteus , resistant to
Macrobid , and Klebsiella , resistant to ampicillin. Levofloxacin
was started for this and for the presumed pneumonia seen on chest
x-ray for a total of a 10-day course. Sputum and blood cultures
have been no growth to date. He had no fevers and no elevated
white counts.
3. Cardiac: He was thought to have an element of autonomic
insufficiency secondary to sarcoid with episodes of hypo and
hypertension in the MICU. His cortisol stim test was within
normal limits , it was 14.5 before stim and 23.6 after stim , so he
was not treated with steroids. His blood pressure was in the
30's to 160's with pauses in the 100's on the floor with frequent
bigeminy and trigeminy and many PVCs , so he was started on 12.5
b.i.d. metoprolol on 7/6/2006 with good results. He continued
to have ectopy and continued to be hypertensive , and given his
diabetes , he was started on a low dose of captopril on 6/20/2006
with no complications and was able to maintain blood pressures in
ideal ranges.
4. GU: Urology replaces suprapubic catheter early on admission.
He was continued to have bladder irrigation with good effect ,
and Urology signed off on 7/13/2007.
5. Endocrine: The patient was given NPH 20 b.i.d. through his
hospitalization and Regular Insulin sliding scale. His sugars
were high on this reduced regimen and so he was placed on his
home NPH doses for discharge.
6. Decubitus ulcer: Plastic Surgery was consulted on 4/29/2006
and the wound did not look infected. It was debrided and
wet-to-dry t.i.d. dressing changes were recommended as well as
Panafil t.i.d. dressing changes. He was prescribed Panafil to go
home on.
7. Renal: The creatinine was initially 2.7 , and after receiving
IV fluids , it came down to 1.2. He likely had acute renal
failure secondary to postrenal obstructive etiology. His
creatinine was stable at around 1 for the remainder of his
admission.
8. Heme: The patient has a history of DVT. Initially , his INR
was found to be therapeutic and he was placed on levofloxacin , so
the plan was that he should have half of his home Coumadin dose
while he was on levofloxacin , so he was given half of dose and
his INRs came down to a nadir of 1.7. His INR was subtherapeutic
for three days , and at that time , a PE was found , his INR was
1.8. The day after this , his INR was 2 and then came up to 2.2
on the day of discharge. He was discharged on Coumadin 5 mg ,
which is his home dose to follow up at his Coumadin Clinic.
9. FEN: He was placed on maintenance IV fluids until cleared to
eat by Speech and Swallow. Speech and Swallow estimates having
baseline aspiration risk and he was known to cough and aspirate
at home. He had been recently worked up at the A County Medical Center
on a recent admission for aspiration pneumonia. They recommended
thickened puree diets and felt that even this he was likely to
aspirate. The risks and benefits of eating were explained to his
wife and him and he decided to continue to eat as there was no
ideal option.
10. Pain: He continued gabapentin , oxybutynin , and
amitriptyline as at home.
11. Prophylaxis: He was given Nexium and Coumadin.
12. Code status: He was full code , which was discussed with his
wife.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
The current temperature was 98 , the heart rate was 91 to 114 ,
blood pressure 100-114/54-70 , respiratory rate of 20 , and
saturating 97-100% on 1-2 liters. In general , he was responsive ,
alert , and appropriate. His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally. His heart had normal S1 and S2 , soft systolic
ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border. His abdomen
had positive bowel sounds , distended , soft and nontender. He had
a suprapubic catheter as well as an ostomy that were clean , dry
and intact. Extremities , he had 2+ peripheral edema that was
stable with no skin breakdown.
LABORATORY VALUES:
His labs at the time of discharge were stable. His hematocrit
was 27.2 , down from 29 , which was closed to his baseline of 34.
His INR was 2.1 at the time discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Amitriptyline 25 mg p.o. at bedtime , vitamin C 500 mg p.o. daily ,
baclofen 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Caltrate 600 Plus D one tablet p.o.
b.i.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. , gabapentin 300 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , NPH human insulin 54 units in the morning , 68 units
in the evening , Regular Insulin sliding scale , levofloxacin 500
mg p.o. daily , to end on 11/23/2006 for a total course of 10
days , magnesium oxide 420 mg p.o. t.i.d. , metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Panafil ointment t.i.d. ,
ranitidine 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily.
FOLLOW UP:
The patient will follow up his PCP , Dr. Dunstan The appointment
with Dr. Carros will be within the next week , and the
appointment with the Coumadin Clinic will be tomorrow or the next
day.
ISSUES FOR FOLLOW UP:
Include following up on his aspiration risk and continuing to
discourage thin liquids as well as encourage him sitting upright
when eating and being observed and stopping when he coughs. He
will need continuous blood pressure and heart rate monitoring
given the new beta-blocker and the ACE inhibitor as well as
assessment of his frequent PVCs. We will continue to follow his
diabetes and continue to follow his INR with a goal being 2 to 3
with ideal goal on the higher end 8 range.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
HPI: Patient is a 64 yo woman with clear cell uterine CA originally
diagnosed in 9/22 - now status post hysterectomy , radiation , cycles of
carboplatin and taxol and then single agent doxil given myelosupression
and thrombocytopenia. She presents with progression of left lower
extremity edema and groin pain. Multiple studies have revleaed an
iliopsoas fluid collection which was drained recently and
previously revelaed atypical cells and were thought consistet with
radiation effect. On 8/28 she underwent an U/S of the LLE which was
negative for DVT , but a cystic struction was again noted in the
iliopsoas and the patient noted that her leg increased in size and she
had worsening groin pain. She was admitted for drainage , pain control
and imaging. ---

Other finding: Liver , spleen , bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable.
Kidneys are normal in size , symmetric perfusion. Large fluid collection
in the L iliopsoas from the sacroiliac joint to the insertion of the
iliopsoas.
------
Hospital course/A&P
1. LLE edema and groin pain: Given pain and fluid reaccumulation drain
placed by IR 9/9 and removed 11/8 Fluid was sterile with no evidence of
infection. Drain was removed due to a concern for the risk of infection
of a sterile fluid collection , particularly given it's relative proximity
to a joint and the risks that could be associated with a joint infection
in this woman. As per IR's recommendations , we asked our colleagues in
orthopedics to participate in this patient's care. They had no
recommendations for the short term given that her fluid collection had
been drained and she was pain free. Recommended that she could follow up
with Dr. Gene Alban in Orthopedic Oncology if her pain/fluid collection
recurs.
2. Pain control: Patient's pain was well controlled by IV morphine ( 2mg
Q4-6 hrs ) after drain placement- only required one day of IV morphine.
Following drainage of the fluid collection she noted that she was much
more comfortable and was well controlled with ibuprofen and low dose MSIR
( minimal requirement ). Will be discharged with prescription for MSIR
should her pain recur.
3. Prophylaxis: Patient received one dose of therapeutically dosed
lovenox pending the read of the MRI - then switched to prophylactic dosed
lovenox.
Patient remained full code throughout this hospitalization
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you have worsening of your leg/groin pain , you should contact your
oncologist.
If you have fevers or chill , nausea/vomiting , or shortness of breath , you
should contct your physician
You were treated for a seroma/hematoma adjacent to your iliopsoas muscle.
There was no evidence of infection based on the fluid collected from this
drainage. If the pain you were having recurs , or your leg edema worsens ,
you should contact your primary oncologist to determine the future
treatment plan. You were seen by Orthopedic Surgery during this admission
- their recommendation was that nothing needed to be done acutely and that
you could follow up with Dr. Clifton Walkner for further evaluation if you
are interested.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
F/U with Kenton Babic - ortho onc if needed. F/u final results of
cytology/gram stain for drained fluid.

Discharge Date: 2/10/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 58 year old woman ,
status post CABG times three in 7/6 ,
status post inferior myocardial infarction in 2/10 with a peak CPK
of 714. She has a history of chest pain since the CABG. The CABG
consisted of a LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein grafts to the OMB-2
and RCA. In 9/16 , she had been cathed and a 70% RCA occlusion with
a question of thrombus was seen. A 90% OMB-2 was seen; a
circumflex of 60% was seen; an LAD of 70% was seen. An LV-gram
showed inferior akinesis and posterior hypokinesis with a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 78%. Post CABG at baseline , she
had substernal chest pain at rest with rare use of sublingual
nitroglycerin. She has a history of peptic ulcer disease which was
a duodenal ulcer with melena. She had an EGD in 5/20 which showed
mild antral gastritis without ulcers. She is status post
colonoscopy in 9/16 which showed diverticulitis. She has a history
of anemia with a hematocrit of 29 , MCV of 68. She was treated with
iron sulfate and H2 blockers. She noted a history in two months of
a 20 pound weight loss. One week prior to admission , she had
melena of loose stool. She felt light-headed. She had a cough and
nocturia. Three days prior to admission , she noted a stabbing
periodic epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting twice; no coffee
grounds or hematemesis. She had dysphagia for months to liquids
and solids with the sensation of aspiration on swallowing. She had
a sharp pain radiating to the left arm and shortness of breath.
The pain was similar to the inferior MI in 1988. On 2/4 , she came
to the emergency ward , where her blood pressure was found to be
110/68 lying and 90/palp sitting. O2 sat was 97% on room air. Her
JVP was 9 cm with crackles at the right base. She was given three
sublingual nitroglycerins and Maalox. Her hematocrit was 20.8.
She was given 10 mg of IV Lopressor from which she became
hypotensive , but this resolved. She was transfused three units of
packed red blood cells , given Lasix and IV H2 blockers. She went
to the unit and ruled out for an MI by EKG and enzymes. The A-set
revealed a CPK of 54; B-set was 48; C-set was 36. An ABG was 132 ,
99 , 7.43 , 33. Potassium was 4.2 , BUN 20 , creatinine 0.9.
ALLERGIES: None known.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: JVD was 9 cm on admission and decreased;
scar at the left base of the neck secondary
to a basal cell resection; II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
left sternal border without gallop. The lungs revealed crackles at
the right base one quarter. She had a kyphoscoliosis. The abdomen
was benign. The neuro exam was nonfocal , though she had some past
pointing secondary to poor eyesight.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 7/5 , she was transferred to the floor. She
complained of some left arm pain secondary to her
IV , but she had no EKG changes and this improved with hot
compresses. She was guaiac negative. On the evening of 4/21 , she
was noted to be trace guaiac positive in the stool. On 7/6 at 7:30
AM , she complained of substernal chest pain which radiated to both
upper extremities with tingling bilaterally. This did not resolve ,
even after giving Maalox , four sublinguals and 12 mg of morphine
and three inches of Nitropaste. Her blood pressure was stable at
130/80 , heart rate was 68 , and she was afebrile. Her substernal
chest pain ranged between 7-3 , and she was given 20 mEq of Kay
Ciel. Her potassium was 3.8 , hematocrit 32.8 and stable. She was
given two more units of packed red blood cells after having been
given two more units of packed red blood cells between 7/5 and 10/27
IV nitroglycerin 50 units was started after one hour and 15 minutes
of pain. This was increased to 100 units. EKG changes were noted
as a flattening in V4 through V6 with no ST depressions , and she
had a T wave down in V3 which was new since admission. On 7/6 , she
was transferred to the unit. Her CKs were negative; A-set was 27 ,
B-set was 29 , C-set was 57 and D-set was 65. A catheterization
showed right atrial pressures of 12 , PCWP of 16 , SVR 1 , 000 , PVR 76 ,
PA 34/14 , cardiac output 6.8. Grafts from the aorta to the OM ,
aorta to the RCA and LIMA to the LAD were all patent. LAD showed
100% proximal occlusion , LAD diagonal showed a 50% long proximal
and circumflex showed a 50% proximal , OM-2 showed a 70% occlusion
at the origin. There was a mild increase in right and left sided
pressures. She was readmitted to the floor and watched. Her
hematocrit remained stable. She had an endoscopy done on the
morning of 7/10 , and the impression was of a large hiatal hernia
with no evidence of GI bleeding at this time. It was recommended
that she had an upper GI and small bowel follow through or repeat
colonoscopy in the future as an outpatient. Her hematocrit
remained stable at approximately 33 for the past four days. The
sed rate was 25 , PT and PTT within normal limits , potassium 4.2 ,
iron 182 , TIBC 432 , vitamin B-12 371 , folate 3.9 , ferritin 16 ,
cholesterol 153 , triglyceride 112

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
PSORIASIS.
CERVICAL DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE.
STATUS POST COLECTOMY.
STATUS POST RIGHT HERNIA REPAIR.
KNOWN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
STATUS POST NON Q WAVE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
IN 1989.
STATUS POST LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING
PTCA IN 1989.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old white
male with known cardiac disease ,
status post non Q wave myocardial infarction in 1989 , status post
left anterior descending PTCA in 1989 , who was admitted following
an episode of post myocardial infarction chest pain from an outside
hospital. Cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , history of tobacco , history of
myocardial infarction. Cardiac history dates back to 3/21 when the
patient experienced substernal chest discomfort and ruled in for
non Q wave myocardial infarction. A cardiac catheterization showed
95% left anterior descending lesion , left circumflex 70% lesion and
diffuse right coronary artery disease. He had PTCA of the left
anterior descending lesion and did well for approximately two
months but was readmitted at that time in 6/11 with recurrent chest
discomfort. A cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 30%
left anterior descending lesion , 40% circumflex lesion and 80% OMB3
lesion and 50% mid and distal RCA stenoses. He had no angina until
approximately two days prior to admission when he presented to an
outside hospital with substernal chest discomfort. He rule in for
an inferior myocardial infarction with CK peaking at 2316. He was
treated with morphine , IV nitroglycerin , aspirin , heparin and IV
streptokinase. He had recurrent chest discomfort post myocardial
infarction and was transferred to Vu Pe Headcount Hospitals .
HOSPITAL COURSE: On admission , the patient's medications were
optimized to increase his beta blockade.
Eventually , the patient was weaned from IV nitroglycerin and IV
heparin to oral nitrates. The patient had no further chest
discomfort during the admission and had a predischarged modified
Bruce protocol exercise tolerance test. He did have some episodes
of shortness of breath secondary to congestive heart failure ,
however , this resolved with Lasix. EKG was consistent with
inferior myocardial infarction on transfer. On 6/9 , he had a
modified Bruce protocol stress test for which he went nine minutes
without chest discomfort or shortness of breath. This was read as
evidence of no ischemia. The patient was discharged home on
5/19/93.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition. MEDICATIONS: On discharge included
diltiazem , 120 mg po b.i.d.; metoprolol , 75 mg po b.i.d.; Isordil ,
20 mg po t.i.d.; aspirin , 325 mg po q day; Glyburide , 25 mg po q

Discharge Date: 6/10/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Jesus Wigham , whose past medical
history includes diabetes ,
hypertension , and multiple prior coronary interventions
( ballooned ) , presents in a stable state for elective coronary
artery bypass graft , after a cardiac catheterization showed two
vessel disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 23 of November the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting , left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to left coronary
artery and then to obtuse marginal. After surgery the patient
became hypotensive and ischemic. A new angiogram was performed
which showed three vessel coronary artery disease , an occluded
sequential venous graft to obtuse marginal and left coronary
artery , and a patent left internal mammary artery graft.
The patient was reoperated; a new coronary artery bypass graft was
performed on 23 of June , a new vein graft was placed to the right
posterior descending artery and another one to the obtuse marginal.
An intra-aortic balloon pump had been previously placed and was
removed three days later.
OTHER EVENTS DURING HOSPITAL STAY: 1. Volume over-load for
which the patient has still
some fluid retention and is still being on diuretics.
2. The patient underwent multiple interventions in her groins ,
mostly for placement of arterial lines and intra-aortic balloon
pump. Some hematoma developed but it never worsened. Vascular
Surgery was consulted but no further intervention was done.
3. A very dubious diagnosis of cellulitis was done just after her
surgery for a redness and swelling in her leg and feet. Infectious
Disease was consulted and they ruled out the idea of cellulitis as
the patient has lichen ruber planus and Infectious Disease said
that this was the reason for her redness. In the last two days of
her stay in our hospital , the redness became a little bit more
visible , and there was some question of increased white blood
cells , so it was decided to start her on Ancef and it should be
continued for about seven more days.
4. The patient is on three days of levofloxacen treatment for a
urinary tract infection.
5. When the diagnosis of cellulitis was hypothized the first time ,
a Doppler study of her lower extremity was done that showed no
obstruction to venous flow.
6. The patient also went for a period in atrial fibrillation and
was treated and converted to normal sinus rhythm with beta
blockers , namely Lopressor.
CURRENT CONDITION: At present the patient is in stable condition ,
afebrile , heart rate 81 in sinus , blood
pressure 120/60 , respiratory rate 20 , with a saturation of 96% in
room air. Her blood sugar is 189 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.8 , sodium
137 , potassium 4.5 , bicarbonate 151 , white blood cells 10.7 ,
hematocrit 28.4 , and INR 1.4.
The list of medications is included in the discharge summary.
Thank you for accepting this patient.

ATTENDING: EUSEBIO HENDLER MD
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Mitral valve regurgitation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 26-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for Hodgkin's lymphoma
requiring chemotherapy and radiation therapy , as well as a
history of splenectomy , asthma , and history of tobacco use , who
presents to our service with symptoms of congestive heart failure
including dyspnea on exertion , lower extremity bilateral edema ,
and decrease exercise tolerance. On the day of admission ,
2/22/03 , she underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed
clean coronary arteries. On August , 2003 , she then
underwent an elective mitral valvuloplasty , 26 Carpentier-Edwards
pericardial , with size 26 Cosgrove-Edwards ring and vegectomy.
In the immediate postoperative period , she was transferred to the
Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit initially requiring 0.5 of
epinephrine to maintain proper pressure. Epinephrine was weaned
to off on postoperative day #1. She was extubated in the evening
of the day of surgery and epinephrine was subsequently weaned to
off. Gentle diuresis was begun on postoperative day #1 as well
as low dose beta blocker , which she tolerated well. She was
transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Step Down Unit on
postoperative day #1 , where diuresis was increased. Baby aspirin
was begun , and the patient continued to make excellent
cardiovascular progress. On February , 2003 , she began to
complain of some persistent numbness and tingling of the left
lower extremity , which she felt to be interrupting her attempts
to stand and maintain balance. For further treatment , a
Neurology consult was obtained. Per Neurology , she was found to
have no weakness at the left lower leg and foot , although when
pressure was exerted on the foot , she reported an uncomfortable
tingling throughout the leg. She reported no back pain and no
change in bowel or bladder control. Sensory examination was
found to be intact , however , soft touch and pin sensation tested
in the lateral leg below the knee caused a spreading tingling
sensation throughout the left lower extremity. Per Neurology
recommendations , Neurontin 300 mg q.d. was begun and it was
recommended that she follow up with the Department of Neurology
following discharge if the tingling sensation has not improved.
With aggressive diuresis , the patient was able to regain her
postoperative weight and by the day of discharge was 1.7
kilograms below her preoperative weight. She has made excellent
cardiovascular progress following this surgery and is anticipated
to continue her rehabilitation at home with VNA System.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese young woman alert
and oriented x 3. HEENT: No carotid bruits or JVD present.
Pulmonary: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Coronary: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 , S2. No murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops appreciated. Abdomen: Obese , nontender , and
nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. Extremities: 2+ pulses at
all extremities bilaterally. Trace edema at the bilateral lower
extremities to mid calf. Skin: Midline sternotomy incision well
approximated , healing well. No areas of erythema or drainage
noted.
LABORATORY DATA: On the day of discharge , sodium 141 , potassium
4.2 , BUN 17 , creatinine 1.0 , calcium 8.9 , magnesium 2.6 , white
blood cell count 11.3 , hematocrit 33.5 , platelets 361 , and INR
1.0.
PROCEDURES: On 6/2/2003 , elective mitral valvuloplasty , 26
Cosgrove-Edwards ring with vegectomy , small sterile vegetations
on A2 and P2 debrided , and found by lab testing to be sterile
vegetations. Cross clamp times were confirmed by Gram stain as
sterile and debrided intraoperatively. Please refer to operative
note for details.
CONSULT: Consulted Department of Neurology with followup
recommendations implemented during this patient's stay.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged today to her home
with VNA assistance.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. x 7 days , Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.d. ,
ibuprofen 800 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n. pain , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Atrovent nebulizer 0.5 mg
nebulized q.i.d. , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.d. , K-Dur 30 mEq p.o.
q.d. to be discontinued or decreased if Lasix dose is changed ,
and Flovent 44 mcg/inh b.i.d.
The patient has been instructed to call to schedule follow up
appointments with Cogang Medical Center Department of
Cardiac Surgery , Dr. Elbert Reitzes , within 6-8 weeks following
discharge as well as her primary care physician , Dr. Keith Lapusnak in approximately 1-2 weeks as well as with her
Cardiologist , Dr. Wilbur Nuzzo in 1-2 weeks. She will
call on recommendation from her primary care physician to
schedule follow up appointment with Tor's Community Hospital Medical Center
Department of Neurology should her left lower extremity tingling
not resolve. At that time , she would be advised to pursue EMG
testing for further workup of dysasthesia. The patient has made
excellent progress following her mitral valvuloplasty surgery and
is anticipated that she will return to her full preoperative
level of independent functioning with continued cardiovascular
rehabilitation and VNA assistance.
Please call if further questions or concerns.

Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: DORIAN SPORN MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Congestive iheart failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Pending.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Bloating , abdominal distention.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56-year-old woman with a
history of an idiopathic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% who
presents with bloating , abdominal distention , and fatigue. The
patient's idiopathic cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 1990. The
patient had a Chronicle device to monitor filling pressures
placed in 2001 , which has been nonfunctional since 2004. The
patient had worsening symptoms in September 2004 , which led to an
admission for diuresis. She showed evidence of fluid overload on
admission of diuresis with IV Lasix and IV dobutamine. The
patient developed a Chronicle device lead thrombus and was
started on anticoagulation. The patient underwent a right heart
cath in September 2004 , which showed an artery pressure of 10 , wedge
pressure of 25 , SVR 2074 , PVR 326 , and CI of 1.5. Post-diuresis
after addition of hydralazine and Isordil , the patient's RA
pressures were RA=8 , pulmonary artery=50/24 , cardiac index of 2.4
with SVR of 1205. The patient's most recent admission was in
August 2004 with decompensated heart failure , during which time
she was diuresed with IV Lasix , metolazone , and dobutamine and
diuresed 11 liters. The patient also began workup for cardiac
transplant at that time. The patient on this admission describes
one week of abdominal distention , lower extremity edema , and
stable two-pillow orthopnea. The patient describes no PND ,
shortness of breath , or palpitations. She also denies dietary or
med noncompliance.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Glyburide 10 in the a.m. and 5 in the p.m.
2. Digoxin 0.125 q.d.
3. Probenecid 500 q.d.
4. Multivitamin one tab q.d.
5. KCL 20 mEq q.d.
6. Celexa 20 mg q.d.
7. Hydralazine 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8. Ativan 0.5 t.i.d.
9. Coumadin 5 q.p.m.
10. Isordil 40 t.i.d.
11. Torsemide 200 b.i.d.
12. Lisinopril 2.5 q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with three daughters. She is
an ex-custodian with past tobacco use but no ethanol use. The
patient's family has no history of cardiomyopathy.
SIGNIFICANT LABS ON ADMISSION: Normal renal function with a BNP
of 1018 and no evidence of bandemia. EKG on admission shows
sinus tachycardia at 105 with normal axis , widened QRS , normal
PR , and no evidence left atrial enlargement , and no change since
1/25 Left heart cath in 1990.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient has no known CAD. She had a troponin at
admission of 0.12 , which subsequently went down to 0.10 less than
assay. It is thought to be secondary to right ventricular strain
with volume overload. The patient was initially started on
aspirin and a statin; however , given her no evidence of CAD and a
normal cholesterol panel , both aspirin and statin were
discontinued.
Pump: The patient presented as ""cold and wet"" with poor forward
flows secondary to systolic dysfunction and likely increased SVR.
The patient was started on dobutamine for improved inotrope.
The patient was also put on a Lasix strip for diuresis after a
loading dose. The patient was maintained on Isordil and
hydralazine for pre and afterload reduction. Her ACE inhibitor
was held while on the Lasix strip. Metolazone also was used to
improve diuresis , and the patient was maintained on digoxin with
level checks every three days. The patient underwent an echo ,
which showed an EF of 15% , global akinesis with
moderate-to-severe MR , moderate TR , and no evidence of
dyssynchrony. The patient had moderate-to-severe RV dysfunction.
Rhythm: The patient was maintained on telemetry , especially
given the fact that she had no ICD in place. EP was consulted
and evaluated the patient for both an ICD and biventricular pacer
given no evidence of dyssynchrony on echo , it was decided that
the patient would undergo ICD placement only.
2. Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.1 on admission and was
monitored closely with diuresis. On admission , she had a normal
UA.
3. Heme: The patient was placed on heparin instead of Coumadin
for Chronicle device lead thrombus with a PTT goal of 60-80. The
patient's platelets dropped from 222 to 166 during this admission
and tests were ordered for the HIT antibody. The patient's
platelets normalized , but unfortunately , the PF4 was positive.
It was felt that this was a false positive and this was confirmed
with a Heme consult. Heme recommended rechecking the PF4 in
three to four weeks and holding heparin products until the PF4
was rechecked. The patient would be restarted on Coumadin after
her ICD placement.
4. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on sliding scale
insulin and Lantus for diabetes management.
5. GI: The patient had right upper quadrant pain on admission
likely related to a congested liver. A right upper quadrant
ultrasound showed a normal liver with thickened gall bladder
walls and ascites , and her symptoms were improved with diuresis.
The patient was maintained on Nexium for prophylaxis.
6. Psych: The patient was continued on citalopram and Ativan
for depression and anxiety. Psych was consulted for assistance
with management.
7. Musculoskeletal: The patient was maintained on probenecid
for gout.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient was on PPI and heparin until she
was on the HIT positive and was placed on Pneumoboots for
prophylaxis.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: To be determined at the time of
discharge.

Discharge Date: 5/17/1992
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. ASTHMA.
4. URINARY TRACT INFECTION.
5. HISTORY OF MELENA.
6. LOW BACK PAIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old black female
with a past history of hypertension
and congestive heart failure who presented to the emergency room
with increasing shortness of breath. In April 1991 , the patient
states that she had a bout of a cold with coughing and chills and
some substernal chest pressure. In October 1992 , the patient had
one 10-minute episode of substernal chest pain associated with
nausea , sweating and shortness of breath. Since then , she relates
increasing shortness of breath on exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , orthopnea and ankle edema. She also has been coughing up
more mucus and at times , blood-stained. She also complains of
dysuria for approximately the past month without hematuria. In
October 1992 , she had one episode of melena which lasted two
weeks. There is no history of peptic ulcer disease. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: Past medical history is remarkable for:
1. Asthma since early 20's. She was intubated once for asthma
in her early 20's.
2. Hypertension since she was a child.
3. History of congestive heart failure.
4. Hysterectomy secondary to fibroids at approximately age 20.
TAH , BSO.
5. Question of chronic renal insufficiency.
Medications at the time of admission are Lisinopril , Procardia ,
Albuterol nebulizer. Allergies are to IVP contrast. Family
history is positive for hypertension. Social history - she lives
with a 23-year-old son and just suffered a family tragedy in the
death of her youngest son who was shot to death three years ago.
Habits - she smokes 1/2 pack a day. She has over a 30-pack year
smoking history. She does not drink or engage in illicit drug use.
Review of systems is otherwise negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , this is a moderately obese
black female in moderate respiratory
distress. Temperature is afebrile , blood pressure 160/90 , pulse
84 , respiratory rat 32 , O2 saturation 97% on two liters nasal
prong. Head and neck exam showed significant jugular venous
distention. Chest showed diffuse expiratory wheezes , some use of
accessory muscles. Cardiovascular exam had an S1 and S2 with no
murmur. The abdomen was obese , otherwise benign. The liver edge
was 12.0 - 14.0 cm by percussion. Rectal exam was guaiac negative.
Extremities had no cyanosis or clubbing but 1+ bilateral ankle
edema. Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal. Musculoskeletal
exam - there was an area of left paravertebral tenderness in the
lumbar sacral spine area.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , hematocrit 35.1 , platelet
count 246 , 000 , white count 9000 with 65%
polys , 1% bands. ABG on unclear FIO-2 was pH 7.48/37/73/95.5%
saturation. SMA-7 was significant for a BUN 19 , creatinine 1.4. PT
12.3 , PTT 31.7. Urinalysis was positive for traced blood and
leukocytes , too numerous to count white blood cells , 7-10 red blood
cells and 4% bacteria on microscopy. Urine culture grew klebsiella
sensitive to Bactrim. EKG was sinus at a rate of 80 , axis -29
degrees , intervals of .196/.116/.1478 , marked left ventricular
hypertrophy with left atrial abnormality with strain pattern in
V3-V6. Chest X-ray was significant for moderate pulmonary edema.
Lumbar sacral plain films showed no significant bony disease. An
Echocardiogram showed a severe left ventricular hypertrophy ,
preserved systolic function , possible diastolic dysfunction and new
posterior wall hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Renal ultrasound showed both kidneys to
be approximately 11.0 cm in size. No
renal artery stenosis was seen though it was a limited study due to
body habitus. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was carried out by the GI
service and no significant lesions were found. The patient was
diuresed for congestive heart failure to which she responded well.
Her breathing was significantly improved by the second hospital
day. It is felt that her hypertension has contributed to at least
clinical evidence of her failure. While in the hospital , the blood
pressure was difficult to control and eventually required the use
of three medications. At the time of discharge , she was running
blood pressures in the range of 140-150 systolic and diastolic of
90 which is much improved for her. A repeat urine culture was
negative and the antibiotics were stopped. Her low back pain was
felt to be muscular in origin and she was given Flexeril for this.
She has no history of peptic ulcer disease but it has been decided
to institute a trial of H2 blocker therapy and reevaluate the need
for upper GI endoscopy in three weeks time. Her asthma was
relatively quiescent but it has been stressed to her that she
should continue to use her puffers.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is stable.
MEDICATIONS at the time of discharge are
Beclovent 4 puffs b.i.d. , Ventolin 2 puffs q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Habitrol nicotine patch q. day , Procardia XL 90 mg
p.o. q. day , Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q. day , Labetalol 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Flexeril 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day. The
patient will follow up at Asacil Calcdennatchbo Valley Hospital on 1/26/92 at 6:10
p.m. She also has an appointment with GI clinic here on 11/10/92
at 2:30 p.m.

ATTENDING: SIMKINS , WILFORD MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Chest pain/SOB.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: In brief , this is an 85-year-old man
with ischemic cardiomyopathy , atrial fibrillation , CRI , and prior
mitral valve replacement , and bioprosthesis presented with DE
compensated heart failure , increasing shortness of breath , and
chest pain. He has complex cardiovascular history and
progressive symptoms of heart failure. He had CABG in 1980 and
1990 and multiple PCI most recently in 6/29 with intervention on
SVG to the PDA. He had MVR in 1980 with bioprosthesis. He had
implantation of a CRT pacemaker with ICV function in 3/7 His
history of heart failure dates back ten years , but he has had
more marked decline over the past two years currently has SOB
typically , does not have orthopnea , PND , or leg edema. He has
been admitted to the Mid-lo Caldent Medical Center several times for
management of CHF in 1/14 After diuresis he states he could
walk up to 30 yards on a flat surface , but could not walk up
steps. He was at baseline until 3/29/05 when he had recurrent
episodes of chest pain respondive to sublingual nitroglycerin
associated with diaphoresis , nausea , palpitations , and
lightheadedness. On 10/17/05 , he had acute onset of shortness of
breath at rest after eating. He was admitted to the Ctr Medical Center and treated with diuresis and anticoagulation. MI was
excluded by serial enzymes. He was noted to be anemic. Other
lab values were consistent with hemolysis. As a part of his
workup , during ETT MIBI , he was able to walk 2 minutes 52 seconds
on the standard Bruce protocol , peak HR 94 , echo showed a dilated
LV , EF of 34% , mild global hypokinesis , and septal and apical
akinesis , enlarged dixed defect in the inferior apical wall with
moderate fixed defect in the inferior apical segment , and a small
amount of reversibility was noted in a mild inferior lateral
defect. Echocardiogram at CMC on 5/13 showed EF of 35% , septal
and apical akinesis , with normal RV function , mitral
bioprosthesis , mildly elevated antegrade velocities , mild
perivalvular regurgitation , moderate TR , moderate pulmonary
hypertension , SVP of 48 mmHg and PA plus RA pressure , transferred
for evaluation and management of chest pain at Slifarb Hospital with ? need for catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CHF , EF is 25% , atrial fibrillation ,
chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.5 , mild
COPD , status post AAA repair in 1995 , BPH , TIA/CVA , anemia , on
home O2 , status post AICD , pacer , status post sinus arrest in
1993 , ischemic cardiomyopathy , CAD , status post mitral valve
replacement , porcine valve placed in 1980 , and status post CABG
x2. Please see HPI for further information.
MEDICATIONS: At home , Flomax 0.4 , Proscar 5 mg daily , Lipitor 80
mg daily , Toprol 50 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 81 mg
daily , and Imdur 90 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , hydralazine 10
mg t.i.d. , Coumadin , Advair , and Combivent.
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS: As above plus Lasix increased to 80 mg
b.i.d. , and Imdur to 120 daily.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Married and lives with wife. Family very
involved. A former smoker , quit in 1980.
FAMILY HISTORY: Alcohol: No history of abuse. He is retired
supervisor in water department. Family history is otherwise
noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: NAD , 60s to 70s , afebrile , and BP is 100
to 110 over 50 to 60. Saturating at 89% on two liters , 94% on
four liters , JVD 12 , mild HJR , bronchial breath sounds , dullness
at bases , and no rales. Cardiac is irregularly regular 2/6 mid
peaking SVM , and 2/6 HSM at apex. Abdomen: Benign. No HSM.
Extremities are warm without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: EKG underlying atrial fibrillation with
ventricular pacing at 70. Labs of note , hematocrit 27 , BUN 38 ,
creatinine 1.8 , sodium 140 , BNP brain natriuretic peptide 482 , CK
61 , troponin 0.1 , haptoglobin less than assay , reticulocyte count
6.2 , and LDH 679.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Cardiovascular: An 84-year-old man with complex medical issues
elderly and debilitated currently with last three to four heart
failures secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. He has undergone
multiples attempts of revascularization including CABG x2 ,
repeated PCI , most recently in 6/29 with intervention on SVG.
Revascularization options at this point are quite limited , the
amount of active ischemic burden suggested by his recent
submaximal MIBI ETT is unlikely to account for the severity of
the symptoms that he is experiencing. Unfortunately , his overall
debilitated state makes surgical intervention unlikely to be
tolerated. He was moderately overloaded at the time of arrival
and was aggressively diuresed. An echocardiogram was performed
on 7/24/05 , which showed moderate known perivalvular mitral
valve leakage and an EF of 30%. A right heart catheterization
was performed on 8/23/05 which showed RA pressure 7/7 , mean 5;
RV 52/1 , mean 4; PA 54/17 , mean 34; and PW 21/40 , mean 23. In
summary , overall dry after aggressive diuresis; however , with
large amounts of mitral regurgitation. For this reason , it was
discussed with the family possible clamping for his mitral valve
as he is not a candidate for mitral valve replacement given his
end-stage heart and generally frail state. Plan as of the time
of this dictation is to undergo TEE on 2/18/05 to evaluate
whether clamping of the mitral valve would be possible and then
to have mitral valve clamping later this week. The patient was
diuresed effectively with Lasix 200 mg IV b.i.d. with metolazone.
The patient was also started on digoxin and Aldactone. He had a
bump in his creatinine to 2.2 on 10/3/05 and then it continued
to rise and for this reason diuresis was held as of 2/10/05. As
for rhythm , paced , normal sinus rhythm , on telemetry. O 2/6/05
brief round of V-tach , paced out of it. An AICD and pacer in
place.
Pulmonary: COPD. On O2 at home , however , with increased
desaturation here in the hospital to mid 80s while walking ,
thought secondary to his extreme mitral valve regurgitation. On
Advair , Combivent , and albuterol nebulizer.
Renal: Elevated creatinine in mid 2s , baseline CRI creatinine
1.5 , and all medications were renally dosed.
FEN: Potassium and Magnesium scales , b.i.d electrolytes given
diuresis.
Heme: Hemolytic anemia with bilirubin of 3.0 likely secondary to
mitral valve regurgitation , not surgical candidate , baseline
unknown. Given transfusion on 2/7/05. Transfuse for
hematocrit less than 30. PTT goal of 60 to 80 on heparin. He
will eventually be put on Coumadin.
CODE: Code status was changed during the time of this admission
to DNR/DNI/no pressors.
This is an interval dictation , please see addendum for remaining
hospital course and for discharge medications.

CARDIOVASCULAR: Patient has an EF of 35%. When last examined in
2003 , on presentation , was volume overloaded. However , BP was
well controlled. Patient was diuresed with IV Lasix and then
converted to an oral regimen. Blood pressure was titrated as
well as heart rate for improved rate control. ACE inhibitor was
initially held in the setting of worsening renal function ,
however , restarted prior to discharge. A repeat echo on 7/25

started on Plavix. Patient was instructed to remain on Plavix
until further notice. Patient has baseline AFib with runs of
NSVT , which improved significantly status post revascularization.
Rate control was improved with a regimen of beta-blocker and
amiodarone. Patient will be continued to be monitored on
telemetry.
PULMONARY: Patient oxygenated well throughout her hospital stay.
Patient was carefully diuresed in the setting of acute on
chronic renal insufficiency in the setting of a dye load. On
discharge , she is oxygenating well on room air.
HEME: Hematocrit remained stable throughout her hospital course.
Coumadin was initially discontinued to proceed with cardiac
cath; however , patient was restarted on Coumadin with PCP
followup to follow INR. At the time of discharge , the patient has
mild thrombocytopenia. PCP will continue to monitor.
ENDOCRINE: Patient has a history of diabetes mellitus , on
insulin , was continued during her hospital stay , increased her
Lantus dose secondary to suboptimal blood sugar control.
Hemoglobin A1c in April was noted to be 6 , indicative of good
control. Patient also has a history of hypothyroidism. TSH
within normal limits and she was continued on her current dose of
Levoxyl.
RENAL: Patient has acute on chronic renal failure , baseline
creatinine of 1.4 to 1.6 , likely secondary to poor forward flow.
Creatinine improved with diuresis. At the time of discharge ,
creatinine was in the range of 1.8. Currently , she will be
continued to be followed as an outpatient. Patient will be
started back on ACE inhibitor prior to discharge. Prior to
cardiac cath , the patient did receive bicarb and Mucomyst to aid
in renal protection. At p.m. , patient was maintained on a
cardiac food-restricted diet.
NEURO , OPHTHO: Status post cardiac cath , patient complained of
left blurry vision. Patient was evaluated by neurology and

Discharge Date: 11/19/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease
CHIEF COMPLAINT: This is a 76-year-old male without previous
cardiac history who is admitted with chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Cardiac risk factors include tobacco
smoking , hypertension and diabetes.
He has no family history , no history of hypercholesterolemia. He
had a negative stress test 10-12 years ago. Usual activity level
is to walk about a block a day. He has a history of severe
osteoarthritis of his neck. Today on the date of admission the
patient had a steroid injection in his cervical spine , which he
tolerated well. He did well until 5:30 p.m. when , while resting in
bed , he noted left-sided chest pain radiating to his left upper
arm , no shortness of breath , diaphoresis or palpitations. He did
not try any particular treatment and came to the emergency room.
The pain had increased in intensity to 10/10. In the emergency
room initial EKG showed T compression in V3-V6 , three lead. With 3
sublingual nitroglycerin and 2/10 , 5 mg IV Lopressor made him pain
free. There was no resolution of his ST changes. He had
recurrence of chest pain two hours later in the emergency room.
Left-sided chest pressure was similar quality to the previous while
lying on the stretcher. His EKG showed flattened T wave changes in
V4-V6 , ST depression 1 mm V4-V6 , evolved he had a T wave inversion
in V3-V6 when pain free. He was started on heparin and IV
nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes hypertension , adult onset diabetes
mellitus , history of renal calculi , benign
prostatic hypertrophy , increased triglycerides , history of malaria
and typhus and dengue fever , history of proteinuria.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Captopril , Micronase and Darvon p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , which makes him itch.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives with his wife. He is a cigar smoker , rarely
drinks alcohol , no family history of cardiac
disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Shows a vigorous white male who looks
younger than his stated age. Pulse 54 ,
blood pressure 107/53 , sat of 95% on room air. Physical exam was
notable only for a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , with
positive S4.
ADMITTING LABORATORY: Significant only for CK of 210. His CKs
never got higher than 210; however , cardiac
component of 1.7 , it was considered that the patient had ruled in
for non Q wave myocardial infarction.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 11/10/95 the patient underwent cardiac
catheterization. He had mildly elevated
right-sided pressures and showed three vessel disease of the 70%
proximal left anterior descending , 90% apical stenosis. He had a

ATTENDING: WHITEY , OSWALDO MD
SERVICE: Et Sa Rill
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Acute and chronic renal failure and
congestive heart failure.
OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES CONSIDERED: Type 2 diabetes ,
hyperlipidemia , acute and chronic renal insufficiency , upper GI
bleed with gastritis , ischemic cardiomyopathy , gout , sacral
decubitus ulcer.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Slauson is a 60-year-old
man with a known history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and CHF , EF
of 35% , status post CABG in 1990 with redo in September 2005 , as well
as mitral and tricuspid valve repair and left atrial
reconstruction in September 2005. He presented asymptomatic from home
after being called by his primary cardiologist as the lab result
showed elevated BUN and creatinine at 244/4.1. This all occurred
in the setting of increased diuresis on torsemide , increasing the
dose from 100 mg by mouth twice daily to 150 mg by mouth twice
daily as well as a recent addition of Keflex for sacral decubitus
ulcer. On further questioning , Mr. Satoe reported symptoms of
increasing dyspnea on exertion with decreased exercise tolerance
as well as chronic loose stools with a history of C-diff
positivity but negative on last testing. He denied any chest
pain , pleurisy , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and both he and
his family denied any change in mental status as well as
hematuria or dysuria , although he did complain of mild urinary
hesitancy. Prior to presentation , he was directed to hold his
diuretics , included torsemide as well as all other nephrotoxic
agents including allopurinol , colchicine , digoxin , and
lisinopril.
His allergies include heparin to which he has heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia.
In terms of medication reactions during this hospitalization , he
was placed on H. pylori treatment with amoxicillin ,
clarithromycin , and Nexium twice daily; and in reaction to this ,
he had mild elevation of his liver function tests.
BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL: Mr. Blackmer is A&O x3 with a BP of
90/60 , heart rate of 84. His lungs are bilaterally clear. His
heart exam shows a regular S1 , S2. Faint S3 with a 1/6
holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex with a JVD of 12 cm
plus V waves. His abdomen is benign. Extremities show no edema ,
but a left lower extremity petechial rash. He is found to be
heme positive with tarry stool , and he has a stable stage 4
sacral decubitus ulcer , well granulated without clear evidence of
infection.
Admission labs are significant for creatinine of 3.6 , BUN of 239 ,
potassium of 5.8 , digoxin of 1.7 , hematocrit of 29.3 , INR 4.1.
Admission EKG showed sinus rhythm with a first degree AV block.
Stable Q's in II , III , aVF , as well as V4 to V6. Left axis
deviation and right bundle branch block and an unchanged ST
depression in V2.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: 11/19/2005 , right heart
catheterization with PA line removal on 6/1/2005. 9/10/2005 ,
upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. 6/12/2005 , echocardiogram.
6/12/2005 , renal ultrasound.
HOSPPITAL COURSE:
1. Mr. Kristin presented with acute and chronic renal failure
with baseline BUN and creatinine at approximately 66/2.4 with a
rapid rise between presentation and the last noted value on
11/15/2005. Although , he was asymptomatic and did not have any
EKG changes , he was treated with Kayexalate and sodium
bicarbonate which resulted in rapid normalization of potassium.
The superelevation of his BUN was thought in part to be due to
possible over diuresis but also complicated by the fact that he
had Hemoccult positive stool as suspicious for a GI bleed as a
source of increased nitrogen. The renal service was consulted
and initial treatment of his acute renal failure included the
above plus removal of all fluid restriction and diuresis in order
to reverse any potential prerenal state. Essentially , all urine
and renal studies including eosinophils and renal ultrasound were
negative with a renal ultrasound showing normal kidneys without
hydronephrosis but without increased resistance in the feet
bilaterally. At the time of discharge , his creatinine and BUN
had fallen to 1.9/81 respectively and remained stable over days.
The initial renal diet restrictions imposed during the
hospitalization were removed towards the end of the stay with
persistently stable values as well.
2. From a cardiovascular standpoint , a repeat echo on 9/12
showed an EF of 35 to 40 with inferior wall and inferior septal
severe hypo to akinesis as well as posterior wall severe
hypokinesis with trace aortic insufficiency , 1+ mitral valve
regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid valve regurgitation but normal left
ventricular size and thickness as well as normal right
ventricular size function. In order to better assess his filling
pressures and fluid status and attempt to optimize his renal
function , Mr. Marthaler underwent a right heart cath with PA line
placement on 11/19/2005 which revealed elevating filling
pressures including right atrium at 26 to 27 , right ventricle
65/13 , PA 64/32 , wedge 36. Pulmonary artery sat 39% , SVR 1568 ,
and pulmonary vascular resistance 221. His cardiac output and
index were both reduced. The PA line was left in for tailor
therapy , and he was initially placed on nesiritide drip at 0.005
as well as a Lasix drip with good urine output and increase in
his cardiac output and index and decrease in his elevated
systemic vascular resistance. On 10/6/2005 , the nesiritide drip
was discontinued and Lasix continued with the addition of
short-acting nitrates in the form of Isordil. Eventually , he was
transferred from the Lasix drip to torsemide reaching optimal
dose of 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. on 2/10/2005 , and further tailoring
with Imdur 30 and hydralazine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for further
afterload reduction were preformed. Lisinopril previously used
on admission was continuously held given the recent acute renal
failure.
3. From an ischemic standpoint , there were no active issues
during the hospitalization. His beta blocker was reduced to 12.5
briefly , but his normal dose of 25 once a day was resumed prior
to discharge. In terms of his rate , it was well controlled on
the above regimen , but his rhythm showed frequent ectopy without
response to diuresis or beta blockade. He does have an ICD in
place which never fired during the course of the hospitalization.
Upon discharge , he was close to euvolemia with an approximate
discharge weight of 67.6 kg.
4. From a GI standpoint , his initial presentation included
heme-positive tarry stools with elevated BUN. He was seen by the
GI service and underwent a colonscopy and upper EGD which were
significant for gastritis without signs of active bleeding as
well as internal hemorrhoids. H. pylori serologies were
positive , and he was initially started on clarithromycin ,
amoxicillin , and Nexium b.i.d. , but this regimen was changed to
amoxicillin , Flagyl , and Nexium b.i.d. given an elevation of his
LFTs on the prior regimen. There was no overt GI bleeding , and
he tolerated the procedure without complication.
5. From a nutrition standpoint , Mr. Splatt was seen by a
nutrition specialist who confirmed suspicion of suboptimal
caloric intake meeting his total caloric needs about only 60% and
total protein needs are 85% despite labilization of his diet and
the addition of Megace. His nutritional goals were even more
important given his large stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer with
poor healing since January 2005. Despite encouragement and the
addition of appetite stimulants with vitamin C , zinc , mineral ,
multivitamins , and the addition of supplements , he presently fell
short of his goals but refused other means of diet
supplementation including NG tube placement and PEG placement and
is determined to provide adequate p.o. intake by mouth. He and
his family met with a registered dietitian and understand the
importance of his caloric intakes.
6. From a musculoskeletal point of view , he has stage 4 sacral
decubitus ulcer which is followed by plastic surgery and
frequently debrided as an outpatient , Dr. Bastress and his team ,
followed the patient while inhouse , and it was treated as per
protocol with b.i.d. dressing changes with Panafil and wet-to-dry
dressings. Initially , he was started on Keflex for suspicion of
infection in the wound , and this was changed to vancomycin given
MRSA growth in the wound and further Klebsiella growth which was
treated with levofloxacin , but these were all discontinued on
10/6/2005 as per plastic recommendations given the high
probability colonization. It was also felt that these
antibiotics would provide appropriate coverage for the possible
right lower lobe infiltrate questioned on x-ray.
7. From an endocrinology standpoint , he has a history of diabetes
type 2 , and he was continued on his Lantus and NovoLog insulin
sliding scale with titration of optimal glucose control in order
to promote wound healing. He was followed by the diabetes
management team.
8. From rheumatologic standpoint , he has a history of gout , and
he was maintained on allopurinol , renal dosing , but colchicine
helps. On about 1/6/2005 , he developed symptoms of podagra ,
and a prednisone taper starting at 15 mg was started with quick
resolution of symptoms.
9. From hematologic standpoint , he has anemia baseline and takes
Procrit once a week as an outpatient. He received 1 unit of
packed red blood cell transfusion on 8/18 and maintained his
hematocrit throughout the remainder of the hospitalization. He
was also maintained on darbepoetin as an inpatient.
Laboratory data showed no evidence of hemolysis with a normal
haptoglobin and LDH , but evidence of decreased iron saturation.
He was started on iron supplementation , and his Coumadin was held
for the supratherapeutic levels on admission and optimize prior
to discharge.
PERTINENT EXAM ON DISCHARGE: Patient was afebrile with stable
vital signs. He did have decreased breath sounds at the right
base know to correspond with his small right basilar opacity with
atelectasis. Other than that , his heart exam remained unchanged
with a regular rhythm , S1 and S2 , S3 , with a 1/6 holosystolic
murmur at the apex. His JVD was 11 cm , and he had no peripheral
edema.
Discharge lab showed a creatinine of 1.9 with a BUN of 81 ,
potassium of 3.6 , hematocrit 32.1 , white blood cell count 9000.
His digoxin level was normal at 0.8 , and his INR was 3.
CONSULTATNTS: Dr. Bingaman from Ox Derd Peake , Dr. Crisan from GI , Dr.
Whidbee from plastic surgery , Armando Mishulovin from nutrition , as
well as the diabetic management service.
DISCARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg by mouth daily , albuterol 2
puffs inhale 4 times a day as needed for shortness of breath
relieving , allopurinol 150 mg by mouth daily , amoxicillin 1000 mg

for PE. The patient initially received a dose of Lovenox 100 mg
b.i.d. but was discontinued given negative PE. The patient was
seen by Pulmonary Service who performed the bronchoscopy on
6/14/05 , which showed a copious blood-tinged mucosa and
collapsed right middle lobe lung with narrow orifice. Brushings
and cytology were taken and sent to Pathology and the results are
still pending. The patient's pulmonary function test showed
severe obstructive disease with the FEV of 0.9 with some aspects
of restrictive disease. She also underwent a bubble study , which
was negative for heart septal defects. The PA pressure was
estimated at 42. The patient then underwent a right heart
catheterization to check for vasodilator response and heart
function. This was performed on 10/10/05 , which showed high
right-sided heart pressures and a pulmonary wedge pressure of
16-18 and suggested that the patient was not in acute left heart
failure. The patient was also seen by the Ookter Highway ,
Pulmonary Hypertension Consult Service , whose impressions were
that the patient's poor pulmonary function is due to COPD and
pectus cavernosum as well as radiation for breast cancer and is
chronic condition. No indication was present for treatment with
primary pulmonary antihypertensive agents. The patient then had
a repeat chest x-ray on 10/10/05 to evaluate for the right middle
lobe , which continues to be collapsed. The patient was stable on
2-3 L of nasal cannula oxygen , saturating at about middle 90s.
The patient was re-evaluated by physical therapy on 3/29/05 and
was found to not need any particular treatments at home. The
patient was discharged to home with home O2 2-3 nasal cannula and
instructed to keep O2 saturations above 88%. The patient does
work in the hospital. The patient's work situation and
disability regarding her lung condition was discussed by the
attending physician.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient is stable with no evidence of
acute CHF , complicating dyspnea. The BNP was normal and JVP
remained relatively flat throughout her hospital course. The
patient was continued on her outpatient hypertensive medications ,
which was captopril and that was given t.i.d. with good control.
The patient was also on Lasix 40 mg daily , which was then
increased to 60 on day of discharge to encourage gentle diuresis.
3. Endocrine: The patient has diet-controlled diabetes at home.
She was on insulin sliding scale and house and required only
several units of insulin a day. Her blood sugars remained in the
mid 100s.
The patient was on Levoxyl 225 mcg daily in-house and was found
to have a increased TSH of 10.5 , therefore dose of Levoxyl was
increased to 250 mcg. The patient is instructed to follow up
with her primary care provider and her endocrinologist in two
weeks to recheck a TSH.
4. Musculoskeletal: The patient complaining of leg cramps ,
chest spasms , and back pain. Back pain appears chronic. Chest
spasms appeared to be musculoskeletal in etiology and not
cardiac. The patient was on oxycodone 5 mg q.4h. p.r.n. and then
transitioned to OxyContin 10 mg b.i.d. with good pain control.
5. Social Services: The patient was seen by Social Services
regarding prescription coverage , ability to handle copayments.
Additionally , her concerns regarding short-term disability and
long-term disability for work were addressed. The patient is to
inquire with her benefit office to determine for services.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with home O2.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Levaquin 500 mg daily for six more days ,
captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 60 mg p.o. daily ,
levothyroxine 250 mcg p.o. daily , Xanax 0.25 mg t.i.d. p.r.n. ,
OxyContin 10 mg p.o. q.12h. , Combivent 1-2 puffs q.i.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient to call if becoming short of
breath , has chest pain , fever over 100.5 or any other concerns or
questions.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: Include 10/17/05 at Bayhead Medical Center for
sleep study where the patient is to arrive before 09:00 p.m. that
night , 10/25/05 with Dr. Chesterman at 02:30 p.m. for primary care
follow-up , Dr. Hilse on 7/18/05 at 04:00 p.m. for follow-up of
pulmonary issues and a two weeks' time follow-up with her
endocrinologist regarding her thyroid condition.

ATTENDING: RANDOLPH DAN OPHEIM MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 66-year-old gentleman who was noted to have an
abnormal electrocardiogram during preoperative testing for his
right shoulder surgery. The patient underwent stress test , which
showed areas of ischemia. The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on 8/28/04 which revealed a left anterior
descending coronary artery with an osteal 90% stenosis , the ramus
coronary artery with an ostial 70% stenosis , first diagonal
coronary artery with a mid 90% stenosis , a 3rd diagonal coronary
artery with an ostial 80% stenosis , left circumflex coronary
artery with a proximal 75% stenosis , right coronary artery with a
50% ostial stenosis , posterior descending coronary artery with a
proximal 90% stenosis , a right dominant circulation and right
renal artery stenosis of 75 80%. Echocardiogram on 4/6/04
revealed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral insufficiency ,
trivial tricuspid insufficiency , low normal to borderline reduced
overall left ventricular systolic function , not quantified. The
patient has a history of atrial fibrillation which was treated in
the past with propafenone which is currently resolved and he has
history of myocardial infarction. He also has a history of class
III heart failure with marked limitation of physical activity.

his right shoulder. History of hepatitis type unknown and renal
artery stenosis and renal insufficiency. He is status post left
rotator cuff repair in 1991.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has allergies to procainamide which causes diarrhea
and arthralgias and verapamil which causes difficulty
concentrating and constipation.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Toprol 25 mg once a day , lisinopril 10 mg once a day , propafenone
150 mg once a day enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg once a day ,

day , and glyburide 5 mg twice a day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Cardiac exam regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or
heaves , peripheral vascular 2+ pulses bilaterally throughout.
Respiratory breath sounds clear bilaterally , is otherwise
noncontributory.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was brought to the operating room on 10/19/04 where
he underwent an urgent coronary artery bypass graft x5 with left
internal mammary to left anterior descending coronary artery
saphenous vein graft to the first diagonal coronary artery. A
right internal mammary artery to the ramus coronary artery , a
left radial artery to the second left ventricular branch and
sequential to the first left ventricular branch. Total bypass
time was 159 minutes , total cross clamp time 110 minutes. The
patient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass without
incident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus
rhythm and stable condition with intravenous insulin.
Postoperatively , the patient did show his atrial fibrillation and
atrial flutter which was treated Lopressor , diltiazem ,
propafenone. He was extubated and placed on his preoperative
inhalers for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He did
have a left-sided pleural effusion which was tapped on 1100 cc of
bloody fluid on 3/26/04. Post-tap chest x-ray revealed a small
left residual effusion and no pneumothorax. The patient was
slightly hypertensive due to renal artery stenosis and initially
low urine output. Renal ultrasound revealed equal size kidneys
and no hydronephrosis. His oliguria was blood pressure dependent
and he did resume urination without use of diuretics. The
patient was also followed by the diabetes mellitus service for
his non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and was put back on
his preoperative dose of glipizide. The patient was transferred
to the step-down unit on postoperative day #6. He did complain
on 5/11/04 of left eye black spot in the middle of his left eye.
The patient was seen by the ophthalmology service which was felt
that this was due to his diabetic retinopathy. The patient will
follow up as an outpatient with his local ophthalmologist; his
symptoms have resolved. The patient required vigorous diuresis

Discharge Date: 2/28/1999
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. ISCHEMIC HEPATOCELLULAR INJURY.
2. ALCOHOL ABUSE.
3. ALCOHOLIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Vomiting , fever , and chills for 18 hours prior to
admission and a cough.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51 year old
African-American female with a history
of long-standing alcohol abuse with two episodes of alcoholic
pancreatitis in the past. She is status post T2 , N1 floor of the
mouth squamous cell carcinoma. This was treated with resection and
XRT. She presents with vomiting x 18 hours. The patient was in
her usual state of health until two days prior to admission when
she began to develop upper respiratory infection symptoms with
congestion and a productive cough. The cough was initially
productive of white sputum and then later which turned dark in
color. She denies any blood tinged sputum or rust colored sputum.
The patient's cough and upper respiratory infection symptoms
progressed and she began to feel weak. On the morning prior to
admission , the patient awoke from sleep with a coughing fit and
subsequently vomited. She denies any hematemesis at that time.
She repeatedly had episodes of vomiting over the next 28 hours
prior to admission and was unable to drink liquids without
vomiting. She reports that she took approximately eight to ten
Tylenol 500 mg tablets prior to admission for her symptoms. She
became progressively light-headed and dizzy , especially with
standing up. She reports subjective fevers although she did not
take her temperature , and also night sweats. She had one episode
of diarrhea which was nonbloody and loose. Her son , who is an
employee of the Hos Medical Center cafeteria , went to
visit her and urged her to go to the emergency room.
In the emergency room , the patient was initially triaged to the
emergent side of the EW , was found to have a blood pressure of
77/50 with a pulse of 138. She was transferred to the acute side
for management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Notable of alcohol pancreatitis in September
of 1998 and April of 1997. 2. Squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck , as previously noted , status post
excision in 1994 with XRT and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. She is
also status post multiple dental extractions and one flap revision.
3. History of total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy in 1985. 4. History of small bowel
obstruction , status post lysis of adhesions , getting an exploratory
laparotomy in September 1997.
ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: None.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: One to three cigarettes per day and one-half to
one pint of brandy each day for ""a long time.""
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per history of present illness. She denies
any orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ,
lower extremity edema , chest pain , or shortness of breath. As far
as she knows , she has no known cardiac history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was relatively well-appearing in no
apparent distress. Her temperature was
98.0. Her blood pressure was 110/84 , her pulse was 101. Her
respiratory rate was 16 and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
HEENT: Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodation; extraocular muscles intact; sclera were muddy
without icterus. Oropharynx was notable for postsurgical changes
on the right side and with dry mucous membranes. Neck: Notable
for no meningismus and jugular venous pressure of approximately 5
cm. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart:
Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , gallops , or rubs
auscultated and a nondisplaced point of maximal intensity.
Abdomen: Soft with mild left upper quadrant tenderness , but no
hepatic tenderness. The liver edge was nonpalpable. There was no
spleen tip palpable and bowel sounds were present. The extremities
were notable for no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema and were warm and
perfuse. Neurologically , she was alert and oriented x 3 with
intact cranial nerve. Her strength and sensation were grossly
intact , 5/5 in the upper and lower extremities. Her toes were
down-going bilaterally and her reflexes were symmetric in the upper
and lower extremities. Rectal examination was guaiac negative.
DATA: Laboratory values upon admission showed electrolytes within
normal limits. Magnesium was 1.1. White count 6.5 ,
hematocrit 48 , platelets 200. Differential: 78 polys , 1 band , 12
lymphs and 8 monos. MCV was 104. RDW was 14. ALT 140 , AST 605 ,
alkaline phosphatase 119 , and total bilirubin was 2.6 with a direct
fraction of 1.5. Lipase was 319 , amylase was 44. Her INRs were
1.1 and her prothrombin time was 19.9 Troponin was 0.22.
Chest x-ray was notable for no infiltrates or evidence of heart
failure.
EKG was notable for sinus tachycardia at 117 with a Q-wave of 3 and
Q-wave in V2 and V3. Q-wave inversions were noted in V3 and V6
with no chest pain.
Urinalysis was notable for 2+ protein , trace keto , 3+ blood , 2+
leukocyte esterase , 28 to 30 whites and 2+ squamous cells.
ASSESSMENT: In the emergency room , the patient was acutely treated
for presumed sepsis and received a dose of ceftriaxone
and clindamycin. Urinalysis results indicated that she had a
potential urinary tract infection at that time. Blood cultures
were drawn and the patient received IV hydration. Her EKG was
noted to have new T-wave inversions as compared to previously with
an indeterminate troponin. She was admitted to medicine for
management.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's hospital course can be summarized
as follows:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient has no known cardiac history. Her
cardiac risk factors include cigarette smoking and postmenopausal
female , age 51. No diabetes mellitus. No known
hypercholesterolemia. No known family history. She does , however ,
drink heavily and has done so for a number of years. She has no
known cardiotoxic effect secondary to alcohol.
The T-wave inversions were noted with an indeterminate troponin.
The patient was admitted in a rule out protocol. She ruled out for
an myocardial infarction with serial CKs which were all below 50.
Her T-wave inversions persisted despite resolution of her sinus
tachycardia. An echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated
dilated left ventricle of 5.6 cm and an ejection fraction of 25 to
30% with inferoseptal and inferoseptal apical akinesis. No
ventricular thrombus was noted.
Cardiology consultation service was asked to see the patient to
evaluation her in the setting of her new depressed ejection
fraction and focal wall motion abnormalities. Initially , she was
presumed to have coronary disease which had been clinically silent
prior to this. She was treated with aspirin , Lopressor and
Captopril 6.25 mg three times a day. Unfortunately , the patient's
blood pressure did not tolerate this antihypotensive regimen and ,
despite efforts to scale it back in dosages , the majority of the
medicines were held. Nevertheless , the patient's heart rate slowed
to the 60s. She experienced one episode of burning chest pain on
the night of admission which was alleved with Maalox. There were
no EKG changes associated with that pain.
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab on September
The cardiac catheterization was notable for a right atrial
pressure of 5. Right ventricular pressure of 36/10. Pulmonary
artery pressure was 35/13 , and the pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 16. Her cardiac output was 6.13 with an index of
3.69. The left heart catheterization noted normal coronary
arteries without evidence of significant coronary disease. Her
left ventriculogram also noted a preserved ejection fraction with
no focal wall motion abnormalities. Dr. Garret Dalrymple of the
cardiac consultation service followed the patient in house and felt
that the reversal of her wall motion abnormalities could be
attributable to the acute effects of alcoholic cardiotoxicity. The
patient will be discharged on aspirin for primary prevention of
coronary disease , as her other medications were discontinued. The
patient was heparinized for her apical wall motion abnormality and
low ejection fraction while in house and the heparin was
discontinued at the time of catheterization.
2. GI: The patient presented with an acute elevation of her
transaminases. The patient's transaminases were noted to be less
than 10 in September of 1998. Initially , it was felt that these
transaminases might reflect alcoholic hepatitis given her
significant alcohol history. The patient reports that her last
drink was on Sunday prior to admission. She drinks about a pint of
brandy every day. The patient's transaminases continued to rise ,
however. The diagnosis of acute Tylenol toxicity superimposed upon
hepatocellular damage from alcoholic hepatitis was also
entertained. She was empirically started on naphthyl cystine and
received approximately two to three doses , however , that medication
was discontinued upon GI consultation. The patient's transaminases
rose to a level of approximately 4000 AST and 1000 ALT , and the GI
service was consulted. The patient's hepatitic serologies were
sent and were notable for positive hepatitis B core antigen ,
whereas the rest of her hepatitis serologies including hepatitis C ,
hepatitis A and hepatitis B surface antigen were negative. The GI
service felt that her hepatocellular injury was most likely
attributable to an ischemic ""shock liver"" condition. She had a
right upper quadrant ultrasound as well which demonstrated a
dilatation of the common bile duct to 1 cm with some biliary
sludging but no evidence of obstructive lesions. Given the
patient's isolated increase in AST and ALT and bilirubin without an
increase in alkaline phosphatase , the diagnosis of ischemic
hepatotoxicity was entertained by the GI service. On the date of
discharge , the patient's ALT had fallen to 221 and her AST had
fallen to 50. Her total bilirubin had fallen to 1.1. The patient
was asymptomatic from hepatic perspective throughout her
hospitalization without any evidence of encephalopathy or
asterixis. An isolated ammonia level was sent and it was 45.
3. Infectious disease: The patient had a repeat urinalysis that
was sent on the morning following admission which was indicative of
urinary tract infection. Urine culture eventually indicated an
infection with Enterococcus. The patient received seven days of
ampicillin while in house , following her initial first day dosing
of ceftriaxone and clindamycin. The patient's urinary tract
infection clear symptomatically. She developed a yeast infection
in her vulvar area secondary to antibiotic therapy and this was
treated with topical Nystatin. The patient was not discharged on
antibiotics as she clinically cleared her infection.
4. FVN: The patient had persistent hypomagnesemia while in house
and required significant magnesium repletion. The etiology of this
hypomagnesemia was unclear; however , it was attributable to her
chronic alcohol use and depletion of total magnesium stores. Her
electrolytes clearly need to be followed closely as an outpatient.
5. Hematologic: The patient's INR slightly increased while in
house but this is attributable to heparin bolus and
supratherapeutic prothrombin time. Upon discharge , the patient's
INR had normalized. She received vitamin K 10 mg x 3 days as
empiric treatment for vitamin K depletion secondary to chronic
alcoholism as well as the possibility for hepatic synthetic
dysfunction.
6. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation for
hypotension was attributable to dehydration; however , it became
clear that the patient normally exists with a low normal blood
pressure of approximately 80 to 100 systolic. It was stressed to
the patient that she must maintain adequate p.o. intake to maintain
her circulating blood volume , as she seemed to be intolerant to the
antihypotensive medicines that were used for cardioprotection. A
random cortisol was drawn and was normal. The issue of potential
renal insufficiency was most likely excluded. The patient will
follow-up on endocrine and electrolyte issues with her primary
doctor.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q.day , Nystatin
topical cream , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
multivitamin one q.day and aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Elroy Forcell in
MES GEERT MEDICAL CENTER on March . Dr. Aamodt was involved in the
patient's hospitalization and will provide excellent continuity of
care as an outpatient.

Tci Prosamp Memorial Hospital on 5/23/06 with unstable angina. The patient
reports that he had been having intermittent left-sided chest
pressure at rest over the past three days associated with
shortness of breath , each episode lasting approximately 10
minutes. EKG on admission revealed sinus tachycardia with a new
incomplete left bundle-branch block and downsloping 1-1.5 mm ST
depressions in V3 through V6 and 1 mm depression in aVL. The
patient was deemed to have a NSTEMI and unstable angina. He was
not heparinized due to the fact that he was on Coumadin for

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Jana was brought to the operating room on 3/26/06 where he
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x3 with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery , a
sequential graft and a vein graft connecting from the aorta to
the second obtuse marginal coronary artery and then to the left
ventricular branch. Total bypass time was 55 minutes , total
crossclamp time was 46 minutes. The patient did well
intraoperatively , came off bypass without incident , was brought
to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm and in stable
condition. Postoperatively , the patient did well. His CK-MB
trended down and EKG normalized. The patient's postop chest x-ray
revealed moderate-to-severe pulmonary venous congestion bibasally
requiring vigorous pulmonary toilet. The patient was extubated on
1/5/06. The patient was also followed by the Diabetes Mellitus
Service for his non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. His
blood glucoses were well controlled. He was started back on his
oral medication of glipizide 5 mg and was covered with a NovoLog
sliding scale. The patient was transfused 3 units of packed red
blood cells postoperatively , and was re-started on Coumadin for his
peripheral vascular disease. The patient's platelet count
dropped to as low as 59 , 000. He had a HIT panel sent off which
came back negative and platelets trended up at time of discharge
to 143 , 000. Mr. Gier was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on
postoperative day #3. His pacing wires were removed , and he was
screened for rehabilitation for discharge. The patient also had
some urinary retention postoperatively and did require Foley
reinsertion and was started on Flomax 0.4 mg once a day. He
failed a second voiding trial and will be discharged with a leg

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
--HPI: Mr. Gump is a 77yo African American male with PMH notable for COPD ,
HTN , NIDDM and recent PNA who presented to SHH ED on 4/15/05 via EMS with a
CC of SOB x 3d. He was seen 2 days earlier at the Dis.ry Medical Center where he
was diagosed with pneumonia and given Azithromycin. The day of admissio
he said his breathing felt more labored and he contacted EMS to take him to
the CHA ED. He also reported worsening exercise tolerance and an increase
in bilateral lower extremity edema over the past few months , accompanied by
a 20lb weight gain. He also noted left sided pleuritic pain made worse by
physical movement and deep breathing. He was treated in the ED with
supplemental O2 and Levofloxacin and admitted with a diagnosis of COPD flare
and right heart failure.

CXR showed old RLL infiltrate unchanged from previous tests.
ECG demonstrated nonspecific ST changes unchanged from previous tests.
--Hospital course:
1. ) Pulm- Pt treated for COPD flare with supplemental O2 , DuoNebs , and
steroids. Since he reported left sided pleuritic chest pain , we evaluated
the possibility of PE with a V/Q scan that reported a low probability of PE.
2. ) CV- Pt's physical exam demonstrated signs of right-sided heart failure ,
notably 12 cm JVD , hepatomegaly and later hepatojugular reflex , and 2+
bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. We proceeded to treat his heart
failure by diuresis with Lasix , initially PO and then IV. Overall , he
diuresed approximately 1L fluid. To further evaluate his heart failure , a
cardiac MRI was obtained and demonstrated normal cardiac anatomy and
function. His LVEF was 73% and he had no valvular dysfunction.
3. ) ID- Sputum was cultured which showed few polys , moderate cocci , 2+
suspected oral flora. Since he remained afebrile and did not demonstrate an
elevated WBC , we did not treat with antibiotics.
4. ) Endo- His diabetes was managed with his home regimen of Novolog.
Steroids may have contributed to his elevated blood sugars. In a previous
discharge summary , it was noted that he had an elevated TSH level. We
followed up on this by rechecking his TSH , which was normal.
5. ) Renal- He an elevated baseline level of Cr. We monitored his Cr and
BUN for an increase with diuresis. While the BUN increased to the low 30s ,
his Cr was stable.
6. ) Prophylaxis- Chronic pain and insomnia were managed with his out-pt
regimen of morphine and oxycodone. He was given Elavil for sleep. Because
of his history of cancer , he was placed on Lovenox for anticoagulation.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please use your home oxygen when you are sleeping at night. We have added
combivent inhalers and a steroid taper to your medicines. Please stop the
hydrochlorathiazide ( hctz ) 25mg. Instead you will be taking lasix 20mg
once a day.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
- Continue Lasix 40mg PO QD at home and D/C home HTCZ.
- Slow Prednisone taper over next 20 days.
- Have PCP address management of HTN medications and OSA. Check lytes on
new dose of lasix. Consider adding ACE inhibitor considering hx of NIDDM.
Episodic hypoxia while sleeping may contribute to pulmonary HTN and signs
of right heart failure observed.

Discharge Date: 5/16/1998
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CHEST PAIN.
PROBLEM LIST: 1 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2 ) HYPOTHYROIDISM.
3 ) PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70 year-old woman who
had coronary artery bypass graft in
1993 who presents with ten minutes of acute chest pain today. In
August of 1992 , she had quadruple bypass surgery with LIMA to the
LAD and saphenous vein graft to the PDA , OM2 and diagonal branch.
She was feeling generally well until the beginning of April at
home. From June , 1997 to January , 1997 , she was in
O and began to experience intermittent episodes of diaphoresis.
These tended to occur with ambulation on a flat surface , although
she did have one episode that awakened her from sleep. The second
time this happened , she went to the Faxtpaul Dekan Health Care there in Ton
with the complaints of diaphoresis and some nausea , although she
did not have chest pain , shortness of breath , vomiting or
palpitations. No EKG was done at the time. She said that she was
definitely more comfortable lying or sitting than standing. It is
of note that she had had her Beta blocker , Pendalol decreased from
5 mg to 2.5 mg prior to this trip to Glension Street On return to the
Gene Er Za , she had upper respiratory and pharyngeal symptoms
with low grade fevers and a cough productive of a green sputum.
This was treated with Amoxicillin given to her by her son who is a
pharmacist. These symptoms gradually resolved and she saw Dr.
Jessie on March , 1997 and was given a clean bill of health.
At this visit , he did start her on Prinivil. Since she had been
home from Er Dr. , Win Ca S , she really had not had repeat episodes of
diaphoresis. Then on the day of admission when she went shopping
and had a recurrent episode of diaphoresis while carrying bags ,
this time with substernal chest pain that radiated down both arms.
She also had a general sense of heaviness across her chest. She
drove home and took a sublingual nitroglycerin that completely
resolved her pain. She describes this pain as exactly like the
anginal pain that she had prior to her coronary artery bypass
graft. The total duration of this episode was approximately ten
minutes. By the time she presented to the Emergency Room , she had
no diaphoresis and no chest pain and was feeling perfectly normal.
The latest echocardiogram in April of 1997 showed an ejection
fraction of 35% with mid to distal septal and apical akinesis and
inferior akinesis with mild mitral regurgitation. In July of
1997 , she went 4 minutes and 18 seconds on an exercise tolerance
test with Thallium which showed only fixed defects , no reversible
defects.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease and
coronary artery bypass graft with cardiac
risk factors of hypertension , family history and high cholesterol ,
hypothyroidism and remote peptic ulcer disease with history of
cholecystectomy and appendectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Zocor 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. 2 ) Prinivil
5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Pendalol 2.5 mg
p.o. q. day. 4 ) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) Synthroid 0.100
mg p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday and Friday and 0.12 mg p.o. Tuesday ,
Thursday , Saturday and Sunday. 6 ) Pepcid p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in Full Quer Dienson with her husband and
has two married sons. She does not smoke and
drinks wine occasionally.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of a myocardial infarction at age 58
and her brother had a coronary artery bypass graft
at age 79 and she has a sister with Alzheimer's disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , elderly woman in
no apparent distress. Vital signs:
Temperature 99.4 degrees , heart rate 87 , blood pressure 115/78 ,
respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The rest
of the physical examination was significant for a clear oropharynx.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular
examination was regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 and a two out of
six systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border with
no gallop or rub. Abdomen was soft with good bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no edema. Neurological examination was
non-focal. Rectal examination was guaiac negative with no masses.
LABORATORY: Laboratory studies were significant for a white blood
cell count of 5.46 , hematocrit 40.1 , platelets 190.
Cardiac Troponin I was 0.0. CK was 102. Urinalysis was negative.
Chest x-ray was clear with no infiltrates. EKG was normal sinus
rhythm with normal intervals and normal axis with a left bundle
branch block pattern and first degree atrioventricular block with
no change compared to an EKG done on March , 1997.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The impression on admission was that this is a
woman with known coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass graft who is now experiencing unstable
angina with diaphoretic episodes , both at rest and exertion and now
substernal chest pain. She ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
On April , 1998 , she had a standard Bruce exercise tolerance
test in which she went 3 minutes , 30 seconds and stopped because of
chest pain. This was typical of anginal pain and resolved eight
minutes into recovery. The EKG had no changes with a left bundle
branch block at baseline and this was considered to be consistent
with but not diagnostic of ischemia. She subsequently underwent
cardiac catheterization which revealed patent grafts with her known
underlying native disease. Her right atrial pressure was 4 , right
ventricular 46/8 , PA 42/22 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 19.
From here , she was managed medically with increases in her ACE
inhibitor , Statin and the addition of nitrates. After the cardiac
catheterization , she developed a large right groin hematoma at the
puncture site and a bruit was noted. An ultrasound was done that
revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the common femoral artery. She was
followed by Vascular Surgery and on May , 1998 , had a
follow-up ultrasound which confirmed the presence of a
pseudoaneurysm in her common femoral artery measuring 2 X 1.5 cm
surrounded by a large hematoma. On May , 1998 , the patient
underwent surgical repair of the pseudoaneurysm without any
complications and she was discharged on March , 1998 with
follow-up with both Dr. Polito of Vascular Surgery and Dr. Khat ,
her cardiologist.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Cardiomyopathy , coronary artery disease.
PROBLEM LIST AND DIAGNOSIS:
1. Morbid obesity.
2. Diabetes.
3. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51-year-old woman
with morbid obesity ( greater than 330 pounds ) , hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus who presents with one week of increasing
dyspnea on exertion. She notes that she can no longer walk from
room to room without resting and she used to be able to walk
around her house. She also notes a frequent need to ""get air""
which also wakes her from sleep. She often opens the window ,
turns on the air conditioning , etc. when she feels short of
breath. She started sleeping on two pillows over the past few
weeks. She also reports an intermittent increase in her leg
swelling and a cough productive of scant clear to whitish sputum.
She was unable to name her home medications , but stated that she
took four medications plus insulin which is in accordance with
her LMR notes. She has not been able to check her fingerstick
blood glucose levels recently because her machine has been
broken. She denies chest pain , tightness except with coughing.
She denies pleuritic pain , any recent illness , any sick contacts ,
any change in urinary or bowel habits , any nausea or vomiting ,
night sweats , diaphoresis or pain in her jaw or arms. Of note ,
her GIES HEALTH primary care physician , Dr. Miquel Crayford , note from
September 2004 noted tachycardia greater than 100 with decreased
exercise tolerance , inability to lie flat , and snoring and
daytime sleepiness. At this time , an echocardiogram performed in
January 2004 revealed an EF of 60 to 65% , trace PR and no regional
wall motion abnormality.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension. Bilateral
DVTs in 1972. The patient is not currently on anticoagulation.
She was on Coumadin for one year following this event.

drugs. She lives with her daughter who is one of her four
children , and eight of her 14 grandchildren in Otteba
She does not work.
FAMILY HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes mellitus. No known MI's.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.8. Heart rate
137 , down to 98 with 5 mg of IV Lopressor in the Emergency
Department. Blood pressure 156/98 , satting 95% on room air. In
general , the patient is an obese , pleasant woman in no apparent
distress. HEENT: Extraocular muscles are intact. Mucous
membranes moist. No JVD. Cardiovascular exam reveals
tachycardia , S1 , S2. No murmurs , rubs or gallops but heart
sounds are distant and difficult to assess. Lungs: Decreased
breath sounds throughout secondary to body habitus , but no
crackles or wheeze noted. Abdomen: Soft , nontender ,
nondistended. Extremities warm and well perfused. Bilateral
pitting edema to shins. Derm: No ulcers or lesions.
Hyperpigmentation noted around neck and under breasts. GU exam:
Very trace guaiac positive stool.
ADMISSION LABORATORY RESULTS: Notable for a blood glucose of
190 , BNP of 271 , and hematocrit of 32. ??_____?? EKG: Sinus
tachycardia at 118 with no ST or T-wave abnormalities. Chest
x-ray revealed mild cardiomegaly. No pulmonary edema. No
infiltrate. PE protocol CT ruled out central PE and showed a
small right pleural effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient had cycled electrocardiograms and
biomarkers. These were negative for myocardial ischemia or any
acute change. The patient was maintained on aspirin , Lipitor 80
mg , beta-blocker , and ACE inhibitor. The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization on 8/10/05 which revealed a 50% LAD
lesion , a 70% D1 lesion. These lesions were not intervened upon
at the time of dictation. This patient is awaiting viability
study.
Pump: The patient underwent echocardiography on 5/19/05. The
findings of that study were very concerning revealing ejection
fraction of 20 to 25% , sharply decreased from EF of 60 to 65% in
January 2004. In addition , the study revealed global hypokinesis
with septal akinesis.
Rhythm: The patient has remained tachycardic and has been
monitored on tele with no noted abnormalities. On the night of
8/10/05 following cardiac catheterization , the patient had a 13
beat run of nonsustained V. tach on telemetry. She received
electrolyte optimization and close monitoring. Following this
episode , the patient's cycled cardiac biomarkers revealed a
troponin of 7.25 , MB fraction of 31 , CK of 283. As noted above ,
she will undergo cardiac viability study on 4/30/05 and may
receive evaluation by the Electrophysiology Service.
2. Pulmonary: The patient's initial presentation was suspicious
for pulmonary embolism given her distant past medical history of
DVT's. However , when she was admitted , she exhibited only
tachycardia without evidence of tachypnea or hypoxia and her
clinical course thus far , as well as her PE protocol CT is not
suggestive of this diagnosis. She has had a minimal oxygen
requirement over the course of her hospital stay. She does
experience dyspnea on exertion , however , has not been hypoxic at
any point.
3. Endocrine: TSH was normal. The patient was continued on her
oral hypoglycemic as well as an adjusted insulin regimen which
will be further altered prior to the patient's discharge. In
addition , she will be discharged with a prescription for a new
blood glucose monitor. Her last hemoglobin A1c check was close
to 12. Given her concerning findings of coronary artery disease ,
she will need to maintain much tighter control of her blood
glucose in the future. At the time of dictation , the patient is
being maintained on scheduled NPH as well as regular insulin
sliding scale.
4. Hematologic: Baseline anemia with admission hematocrit
improved from prior infectious diseases. The patient's
productive cough was thought to be not due to infection. The
patient has remained afebrile with normal white blood cell count
over the course of her hospital stay.
The remainder of this patient's hospital course and her discharge
medications will be dictated in a future addendum.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Heart failure.
LISTS OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES: Status post cardiac transplant
in 1993 , obesity , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , chronic renal insufficiency
with a baseline of creatinine of 1.5 , hepatitis B , hypertension ,
osteoporosis , status post L3 compression fracture , status post
left hip fracture with replacement in September 2005 , complicated by
infection necessitating removal , debridement , and deconditioning.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Halnon is a 67-year-old
female with multiple medical comorbidities and a past medical
history significant for cardiac transplant in 1993 , and hip
replacement in September 2005 , complicated by wound infection , and need
for prolonged rehabilitation who presented from Port Medical Center to Ephma Mersources Ni Memorial Hospital with three days of
progressive worsening shortness of breath. Her chest x-ray was
consistent with congestive heart failure , and she was transferred
to Ckmond Kinga Quinaualv Medical Center with the request of her daughter
for further management of her heart failure. Here , her mental
status was borderline upon admission , but it improved with
discontinuation of standing analgesic and decreasing of her
clonazepam. A head CT showed no acute processes. She had a
right upper arm cellulitis and urinary tract infection on
screening urinalysis. She was anemic. She was found to be
vancomycin resistant Enterococcus positive , but repeated cultures
demonstrated MRSA negative. Her inpatient issues included
management of her heart failure , right upper extremity
cellulitis , urinary tract infection , chronic anemia , diabetes ,
and evaluation of her hip by orthopedics.
ALLERGIES: She had allergies to penicillin and codeine , but the
reactions are unknown.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Vitamin C , Imuran , PhosLo , iron
sulfate , Deltasone , Coumadin , Aranesp , Dilaudid for pain ,
lactulose , Reglan , Sarna topical , Senokot , Ambien for sleep ,
miconazole powder , cyclosporine , Celexa , and Lasix 80 mg once per
day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile. Her blood pressure was
130/57 , and her pulse 120 in sinus tachycardia. She was 95%
saturated on 3 liters. Physical exam was significant for
bibasilar crackles in her lungs. 2+ edema in her legs to her
knees. A 5 cm x 5 cm area of warm erythema in her right upper
extremity and a left hip wound with packing in place granulation
tissue.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: CT of her head , which showed no acute
processes. Echocardiogram of her heart showed an ejection
fraction of 55%. Normal right ventricle and structure with mild
to moderately reduced systolic function in her right ventricle.
Moderately dilated left atrium , moderately dilated right atrium ,
normal aortic valve , mild to moderate mitral regurgitation , and
structurally normal tricuspid valve. Right upper arm ultrasound ,
which showed no evidence of venous obstruction.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: Ms. Gockley 's inpatient issues
included management of her heart failure , right upper arm
extremity cellulitis , urinary tract infection , chronic anemia ,
diabetes and evaluation of her hip by orthopedics. For her heart
failure , she was diuresed with IV and transitioned to oral
torsemide and they entered discharge dose of torsemide 200 mg
p.o. twice per day. Her admission weight was 133 kg and her
discharge weight 122 kg. She should continue on her current
torsemide and limit her daily salt intake , and restrict herself
to 2 liters per day for her right upper extremity cellulitis.
She was given a five-day course of levofloxacin ( used to address
recurrent UTI ) and then a two-day course of Ancef , her cellulitis
cleared with this regimen. For her urinary tract infection , she
was initially treated with levofloxacin and transitioned to
Bactrim based on antibiogram sensitivities. A long-term Foley
catheter was removed. Repeat cultures showed bacteria in her
urine; however , she was clinically asymptomatic , it was felt that
this is more consistent with colonization and no further
treatment was instituted. If needed for further antibiotics , a
PICC line was placed on May , 2005 , after her prior PICC
line clotted. Prior to discharge , a new Foley catheter was
placed and she was incontinent of urine and overall more
comfortable with catheter in place. While on Bactrim for her
UTI , her creatinine rose to a peak of 2.0 , it was unclear whether
this raise was due to diuresis or the antibiotic. With cessation
of the antibiotic , her creatinine trended downward to her
baseline at 1.6. For her chronic anemia , the patient was
continued on iron ( which was increased to three times per day )
and darbepoetin , folate was added. She was asymptomatic from her
chronic anemia. She was given two units of packed red blood
cells in May , 2005 , and two more units on February ,
2005 , and she responded appropriately to this. Her discharge
hematocrit was 30. Her hip was evaluated by orthopedics. They
felt her hip was healing well. She should be continued on
wet-to-dry dressings. No further orthopedic intervention is
planned. She can bear her full weight on her hip. At discharge ,
the patient was hemodynamically stable , afebrile , and breathing
comfortably on three liters of oxygen. She was discharged to
Naor Viewmor Hospital and should work aggressively towards
reconditioning.

Discharge Date: 7/28/1992
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: APPENDICITIS.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: GRAVES' DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 35-year-old woman
with a history of Graves' disease and
known cholelithiasis who presented to the Leadreid Hospital Emergency Room with a 12 hour history of increasing right
upper quadrant and right lower quadrant abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting and a fever. She had one normal bowel movement on the day
of admission. She denied pyuria , anorexia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Graves' disease. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None. MEDICATIONS: On
admission included , 10 mg po b.i.d.; Inderal , 40 mg po
b.i.d. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. HABITS: Negative
smoking history. No alcohol intake.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed an ill appearing
female in moderate distress. Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac exam revealed a regular
rate and rhythm. Abdomen was soft , nondistended , right lower
quadrant and right upper quadrant tenderness , lower greater than
upper , positive bowel sounds , negative Murphy's sign. No shake or
peritoneal signs. Rectal exam revealed normal tone , no masses ,
nontender , no stool in vault.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a white blood cell
count of 14.33. Hematocrit 36.3. Urinalysis
revealed 15-20 red cells.
PROCEDURES: EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY.
APPENDECTOMY.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor. There ,
she had a temperature of 102.2 and a pulse of
152. She continued to experience right upper and right lower
quadrant pain , lower greater than upper. Because of a known
cholelithiasis , differential of her right sided abdominal pain
included , primarily , cholecystitis and appendicitis. She thus
underwent abdominal ultrasound. Ultrasound revealed right upper
quadrant gallbladder with mildly thickened walls , gallstones , but
no common duct dilatation or pericholecystic fluid. The right
lower quadrant revealed thickened small bowel walls but peristalsis
was also identifiable. Using the ultrasound probe , the right lower
quadrant was certainly more tender than the right upper quadrant.
On serial examinations , her abdominal pain and tenderness became
gradually worse and her temperature continued to remain high
spiking to 101 to 102. She was thus brought to the Operating Room
for an exploratory laparotomy. A paramedian incision was made and
appendicitis noted. The gallbladder appeared grossly normal. She
tolerated the procedure well without any complications.
Postoperatively , she continued to have high temperature spiking
over 103 degrees. She also became tachycardic to approximately
150. Because she had not been taking her medications for a few
days preoperatively as well as because she had tremor ,
hyperreflexia , fever , and tachycardia she was suspected to be
thyrotoxic. Of note , she had been in atrial fibrillation one month
prior to admission. Endocrinology consult was obtained and based
on their recommendations , she was restarted on , 15 mg po q
six hours; Inderal , 40 mg po q six hours; SSKI , one-third of 1 cc
po t.i.d. Thyroid function tests were sent. She gradually
defervesced. Her heart rate diminished and her ambulation was
rapidly advanced. Her wound was noted to be slightly erythematous
and she was thus started on Velosef.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: On discharge included Percocet , one
to two tablets po q four hours p.r.n.; Inderal , 40 mg
po q six hours; SSKI , one-third cc po t.i.d.; , 10 mg po
t.i.d.; Velosef , 500 mg po q.i.d. times seven days.

Discharge Date: 2/29/1994
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS: HYPOTENSIVE EPISODE.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. End stage renal disease on chronic
hemodialysis. 2. Mild mental retardation.
3. Movement disorder ( tics ). 4. Status post parathyroidectomy.
5. Partial thyroidectomy. 6. Status post partial gastrectomy for
peptic ulcer disease. 7. History of MRSA from wound in 1988.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46-year-old
gentleman with end stage renal disease
on chronic hemodialysis who was admitted status post fall and
seizure. The patient's end stage renal disease is thought to be
secondary to hypertension , although he has never had a renal
biopsy. He has been on hemodialysis since 1987 , having dialysis
three times a week. His dry weight is about 85 to 86 kilos. His
dialysis has been complicated by multiple episodes in the past of
hypotension and seizure activity occurring after dialysis. These
episodes occur about once a month.
On the day of admission , the patient came home from routine
hemodialysis where he was ultrafiltered 5.5 kilograms of fluid and
his final blood pressure after dialysis was 100/60. At noon , the
patient went home , ate lunch and went up to his room. At that time
he complained of feeling dizzy and sitting on the edge of the bed
told his uncle that he was not feeling well and then slumped onto
the floor. He does not believe that he hurt himself , i.e. , did not
hurt his head , although he did complain of some right foot pain.
He was still conscious as his uncle lifted him back to bed and then
an ambulance was called.
After a few minutes , the patient lost consciousness , rolling his
eyes back with some facial twitching bilaterally and tongue
retraction. This episode lasted about five minutes. There was no
tongue biting , no urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence. The
patient gained full recovery of his alertness upon waking up but
was a bit diaphoretic. His aunt checked his vital signs which were
blood pressure 70/40 , pulse 79. The patient had also complained of
chest pain for a few minutes prior to his episode. When the EMTs
arrived , the patient was alert and oriented times three , cold and
clammy , temperature 98.6 , pulse 89 , respirations 26 , blood pressure
82/60.
The patient was brought to the emergency room and was orthostatic
by blood pressure ( 10 points ) from lying to sitting. He was given
500 ccs of normal saline and was no longer orthostatic , comfortably
sitting up in the bed. At about 9:00 p.m. he complained of feeling
dizzy and became diaphoretic while trying to stand up. The patient
was again brought into bed. He became unresponsive for one minute
with his eyes rolled up and some bilateral face twitching. This
episode only lasted about one minute. The patient was admitted for
observation.
Past medical history reveals the following: 1 ) Mild mental
retardation since about 10 years ago. 2 ) Movement disorder ( tics )
on Stelazine. 3 ) End stage renal disease thought to be secondary
to hypertension. 4 ) Status post parathyroidectomy for secondary
hyperparathyroidism. 5 ) Partial thyroidectomy for goiter
incidentally found at surgery. 6 ) Status post partial gastrectomy
for peptic ulcer disease in the 1960's. 7 ) History of MRSA from
wound in 1988. 8 ) Hepatitis B surface antibody positive and
hepatitis C virus positive. Medications on admission: Calcium
carbonate , 1250 mg PO tid; nephrocaps , 1 PO qd; DHT , 0.2 mg PO qd;
Stelazine , 2 mg PO tid. There are no known allergies. Social
history: The patient was a former smoker and has a history of
alcohol abuse but no IV drug use. He lives with his aunt and uncle
and is mildly retarded.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , vital signs
showed a lying blood pressure of 96/60 ,
pulse 80 , sitting up blood pressure 104/70 , pulse 96 , temperature
97.5 , O2 sat 95% on room air. The patient was a well nourished ,
black male in no apparent distress. HEENT exam was unremarkable.
Neck showed JVD of 4 cms. No lymphadenopathy. Chest was clear to
auscultation. Heart revealed S1 , S2 , normal rate and rhythm with a
1/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border.
No CVA tenderness. Abdomen was soft , nontender , no masses. Bowel
sounds were positive. The patient was guaiac negative with brown
stool. Extremities revealed a tender , edematous dorsal aspect of
right foot , with full range of motion at the ankle joint. Left
extremity benign. Neuro exam was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , sodium 142 , potassium 4.8 ,
chloride 94 , bicarb 32 , BUN 38 , creatinine 8.6 ,
glucose 168. A CBC revealed white count of 8.82 , hematocrit 35 ,
platelets 246. Calcium was 9.7. Chest x-ray revealed mild
pulmonary vascular redistribution with no significant CHF and no
infiltrates. Ankle x-rays on the right revealed no fracture or
dislocation. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 76 ,
axis 2 degrees , some 1 mm ST elevations in I and AVL , T-waves flat
in lead III. The slight elevations in ST were consistent with EKG
on 1/9/94.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was observed overnight and put on
an oral renal diet , checking orthostatics
frequently. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout his
hospital course and remained hemodynamically stable with no
orthostasis. The patient was evaluated by the renal service who
assessed that this episode was most likely secondary to the
extensive fluid removal from dialysis leading to a low blood
pressure. In addition , they noted that seizures and orthostasis
are often seen status post dialysis in some patients. They
recommended no further work up of this seizure episode and
recommended no prophylaxis with an antiepileptic. The patient
underwent dialysis again on 6/5/94 per schedule. After this
dialysis , the patient was asymptomatic , not orthostatic and did not
complain of any light headedness.
As the patient complained of right foot pain , right foot films were
obtained which revealed nondisplaced fractures of the second ,
third , fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. Orthopaedic service was
consulted who put the patient in a bivalve cast with a toe plate.
Physical therapy was consulted. The patient was allowed to sit in
a chair and engage in nonweight bearing activities. His foot was
elevated on three pillows for 72 hours. The patient remained
hemodynamically stable and now awaits placement into a skilled
nursing facility for rehabilitation , given his casted right lower
leg.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged on his medications
from admission which include: 1 ) Nephrocaps , 1 PO
qd. 2 ) Calcium carbonate , 1250 mg PO tid. 3 ) DHT , 0.2 mg PO qd.
4 ) Stelazine , 2 mg PO tid. The patient will be seen again in
orthopaedics clinic on Friday , 5/13/94 at 9:15 a.m. The patient is
discharged in stable condition to a rehab/skilled nursing facility
per wishes of patient , family and per recommendation of physical
therapy.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: 59F w/ CAD recently RCA/OM1 stent admitted with
nephrolithiasis for pain control. HPI: hx chronic pain syndrome on
percocet and morphine ( also for OA ) , who recently had R heart
cath and PCI 1 wks ago. During that admission , was noted to have
hematuria --> renal f/u. C/O L flank pain x 2 days , planned for CT.
In Cards clinic on DOA , noted poor pain control. admitted by ED for
pain control. Got ASA , no IVF. morphine. PMH: chronic pain syndrome ,

EVENTS: in ED OBS appeared comfortable on dilaudid and
morphine. ----------
STATUS: resumed on home pain regimen , required additional 25 mg oxycodone
overnight.
--------- STUDIES:
I- CT showed: kidney stones on R , by CT ureter in ED , no hydro.
stones are old , not clear that this is causing her current pain.
-------- IMP: 59F with CAD and recent PCI now with
nephrolithiasis and pain control problems. PLAN:
1. CV: gave lasix to increase filtration and UOP , while
increasing IVF to keep up w/ euvolemic state.
- cont outpt regimen - asa , statin , bb , acei. 2. GU/RENAL: increase
UOP w/ IVF and Lasix. 3. ID: does not appear to have systemic
infection. Inflammation of ureter. tx UTI ( UA+ ) with cipro 250 mg PO x 7
days. Started 4/23 , ending 3/6
4. FEN: Diabetic , low salt , low fat/cholesterol diet 5. Pain control with
home regimen of MScontin and
oxycodone. Switched to 45 mg oxycontin PO q12h instead of MS contin upon
discharge as patient requiring frequent PRN for breakthrough. Of note ,
back pain crosses lumbosacrum , radiates down legs bilaterally , and to
groin bilaterally. This distribution is consistent with a
more mucskuloskeletal etiology of pain , rather than R-sided
nephrolithiasis.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You must continue your medications , especially aspirin and plavix to
protect your stent. Continue the Ciprrfloxacin for your UTI. Follow up
with your doctors or call to reschedule the appointments. Call your
doctor or return to the ER if you have fever , chills , sweats , worsening
shortness of breath , chest pain , or any other problems.

Discharge Date: 2/13/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: LEGIONELLA PNEUMONIA , BILATERAL PLEURAL
EFFUSIONS.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57-year-old
female with a distant history of
ovarian cancer , rheumatoid arthritis with systemic lupus
erythematosus features , and history of TTP , status post
splenectomy , who was admitted with fever , shortness of breath and
pleuritic chest pain. She was in her usual state of health until
October of this year , when she began to experience dyspnea on
exertion , shortness of breath one week after her husband died.
Initially she thought it was anxiety secondary to her husband's
death , but this shortness of breath began to increase and occurred
on rest. She also reports that she has had a recent history of
orthopnea and says that for the past few months she has had
bilateral lower extremity edema with gradual onset. She also has
had a dry , non productive cough for the past month and three days
ago began to have fevers up to 102 , chills , nausea , dry heaves ,
headache and diarrhea. The shortness of breath has increased in
intensity and yesterday she began to experience sharp pleuritic
right chest pain. She denied productive cough , neck stiffness ,
photophobia , sick contacts , chest pain , palpitations , or recent
travel. Of note , the patient had been on Plaquenil previously but
she self discontinued this three months ago because she has been
feeling well. She has had no recurrence of her rheumatoid
arthritis symptoms , which for her include arthritis in her hands.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is significant for
diabetes type 2 , hypertension , TTP , history
of splenectomy , history of Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal
sepsis , rheumatoid arthritis with systemic lupus erythematosus
features , history of osteomyelitis in the right ankle , history of
ovarian cancer in 1989 , status post chemotherapy , total abdominal
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications include diltiazem 240 mg a day ,
lisinopril 40 mg a day , Naprosyn 500 mg b.i.d. , NPH
insulin 24 units subcutaneously q.a.m. , Entex-LA.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her son. Her husband recently
died in October of this year with esophageal
cancer. She has no alcohol or tobacco use. She is an elementary
school teacher.
FAMILY HISTORY: Family history is significant for coronary artery
disease as well as breast carcinoma.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , the patient was
afebrile with a temperature of 98 , pulse in
the 100s , blood pressure 182/99. The patient's oxygen saturation
was 92% on 5 liters. She was alert and oriented , in mild
respiratory distress. The skin was without rash. HEENT: Not
significant. NECK: The neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly. CARDIOVASCULAR: Tachycardic , regular rhythm , without
murmurs , gallops or rubs. She had no jugular venous distention.
LUNGS: The lungs revealed markedly decreased breath sounds at the
bases and faint crackles at the bases on the right. ABDOMEN:
Abdominal examination was completely benign. No hepatomegaly or
masses. She did have a scar from the splenectomy. EXTREMITIES:
The extremities showed 1+ edema bilaterally. There were no cords.
Negative Homans' sign. There was no clubbing or cyanosis.
NEUROLOGICAL: The neurological examination was intact.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant laboratory studies included a
sodium of 137 , white blood cell count of 19.5
with 2 bands and 86 polys as well as Howell-Jolly bodies.
Hematocrit was 38.6 , platelets 495 , 000. CK was 50 , troponin was 0.
D-dimer was greater than 1 , 000. Chest x-ray revealed large
bilateral pleural effusions , left greater than right. She had a CT
scan which was a limited study that showed no evidence of a
pulmonary embolism. It showed a questionable infiltrate in the
right lung versus compressive atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 57-year-old female with a
distant history of ovarian cancer and TTP , who
was admitted with likely community acquired pneumonia and bilateral
moderate to large pleural effusions. Initially the patient was
given cefuroxime and levofloxacin in the emergency department for a
presumed community acquired pneumonia. She also was given Lasix
for diuresis , given there was a question of whether or not she was
having any heart failure. Given her elevated D-dimer , she had a
spiral CT scan of the chest which did not reveal any evidence of
pulmonary embolus and also had lower extremity Dopplers which were
negative. However , there was a continuous Doppler wave form on the
study which raised the suspicion of a more proximal venous
compression. Therefore , she underwent abdominal CT scan , which did
not show any evidence of venous obstruction as well as lymphatic
obstruction.
1 ) INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient was admitted and treated for
what was thought to initially be just a community acquired
pneumonia with large effusions , likely peripneumonic in nature.
She initially was started on cefuroxime and azithromycin by the
General Medicine team. She was pancultured as well as had
Legionella urine antigen sent. Subsequently her Legionella urine
antigen became positive and repeat test again revealed that this
was in fact positive. At that time , levofloxacin was added given
recommendations from the Infectious Disease Service. She was
continued on azithromycin; however , cefuroxime was discontinued as
there was no evidence of other etiology of her pneumonia. She
underwent thoracentesis late the evening of her admission , which
revealed a transudate. Cytology was sent on this and was negative
as well as all cultures were negative from this. She underwent
multiple bilateral therapeutic pleuracentesis , given that the
effusions were quite large. Ultrasound revealed multiple
loculations on the right side and she had to undergo right sided
ultrasound guided thoracentesis to remove fluid. In addition , the
patient was aggressively diuresed with Lasix to help with the
effusions.
The patient continued to have a high oxygen requirement throughout
the hospitalization despite aggressive thoracentesis. However , as
she was diuresed aggressively , her oxygen requirement was down from
initially 5 to 6 liters per nasal cannula. Prior to discharge , she
was off of O2 except that she had desaturations to 86% with
ambulation. Therefore , she was discharged home with p.r.n. oxygen.
She remained afebrile throughout the rest of the hospitalization
and her pulmonary status continued to improve prior to discharge.
Other complications during the hospitalization included an elevated
platelet count up to 800. This was thought likely to be acute
phase reactant secondary to infection and fever and this will be
followed as an outpatient. In addition to this , she had an
elevated CA-125 level. This was discussed with her GYN oncologist
and he felt that this was likely from the effusions , but again
should be followed as an outpatient to make sure that this resolves
as the effusions continue to resolve. Abdominal CT scan , which was
done to rule out more proximal venous compression did not reveal
any recurrence of ovarian cancer.
The patient was discharged to home on October , 2000 , with services
as well as p.r.n. oxygen. She was in stable condition. She had no
problems with her diabetes , hypertension , rheumatoid arthritis
throughout the rest of her hospitalization.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her discharge medications include Lasix
80 mg b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale ,
lisinopril 40 mg a day , levofloxacin 500 mg times 14 days ,
Cardizem-CD 240 mg p.o. q.d.
FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow-up with Dr. Michalek in one week and
she is to have her platelets checked as well as a
CA-125 as her Legionella pneumonia resolves.

Discharge Date: 1/20/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
PROBLEMS DURING ADMISSION: 1 ) MIGRAINE HEADACHE.
2 ) NONSPECIFIC ABDOMINAL PAIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 35 year old female
who carries a diagnosis of lupus for
seven years , recently discharged with a pulmonary embolism and deep
vein thrombosis , on Coumadin and Lovenox , now returns with a
complaint of new onset chest pain and sob. Previously the patient has been
stable with her SLE but had started Plaquenil recently. On
9/28/99 she presented to her rheumatologist complaining of
intermittent leg swelling for the past year and was found to have
left superficial femoral and gastrocnemius DVT. She was about to
begin Lovenox when she mentioned that she had also experienced
occasional pleuritic chest pain over the last five years. She then had a V/Q
scan which was read as intermediate probability for PE. For definitive
diagnosis , a pulmonary angiogram was done on 2/28/99 showing bilateral apical
small pulmonary emboli.She was treated with IV heparin and was started on
Coumadin to a therapeutic INR of 2.0. She also had an unremarkable
echocardiogram at that time. On 2/30/99 , the patient returned
with increasing wheezing and shortness of breath. Her INR was 1.8.
Work up revealed an intermediate probability right-sided V/Q
mismatch with a probable new PE. Repeat echocardiogram showed no right
heart strain. It was thought that she had had a recurrent PE in
the setting of subtherapeutic INR. LE DVT was stable on the LENIs.
She was discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin to obtain a goal INR of
3.0. Unfortunately , two days prior to admission , the patient again
noted increased dyspnea on exertion. She has otherwise been
active , feeling well over the past week. She denies chest pain ,
leg pain , wheezing. V/Q scan performed on the morning of admission
showed new mismatched lesions at the left posterior base and right
anterior base. She notes stomach upset for the previous four days ,
recently had an upper GI work up , including an EGD which was
negative by patient's report. She denies any melena , nausea ,
vomiting , BRPPR. She has been tolerating p.o.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) SLE x 7 years , on Plaquenil recently.
2 ) Migraine headaches. 3 ) History of DVT.
4 ) Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 5 ) Status post
cesarean section.
ALLERGIES: Bactrim causing diarrhea , Ceftin causing diarrhea.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Tylenol p.r.n.; Plaquenil 200 mg q. d.;
Coumadin 7 mg p.o. q. d.; Lovenox for
the previous 6 days; Allegra; Albuterol MDI; Cipro; Heptadine.
FAMILY HISTORY: No history of clotting or bleeding disorders.
Her father died of leukemia. She has two sisters
with arthritis and one sister with ulcerative colitis.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has been married for 10 years and has
an eight-year-old daughter. She is an office
worker in Ver Albpids , Pennsylvania 98749 and has not worked for the past month. She
quit smoking on 9/28/99 at the time of her first admission. She
has 10-15 pack years and denies any history of alcohol or IVDU.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: An obese , pleasant , female in no acute
distress. Pulse 87. Blood pressure 118/50.
Saturation 97 percent on room air. Afebrile. HEENT: Oropharynx
is clear. Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly or
JVD. Lungs are clear to auscultation except scattered rales at the
right base. Heart normal S1 and S2. A II/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the left upper sternal border. Abdomen - large , obese ,
nontender , nondistended. Extremities - no palpable cords or edema.
Neurologic - alert and oriented , no focal deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 0.7 , WBC 105 , hematocrit 40 , platelets
307. Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at
86. Normal intervals and axis. No ST-T wave abnormalities.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient was
placed on intravenous heparin and the Lovenox and Coumadin were
discontinued in anticipation for an IVC filter placement the
following morning. She also received intravenous dihydroergotamine
for migraine headaches with good effect by the following morning.
The following morning , the patient received 2 units of FFP because
her INR was 3.0. The decision to place a filter was postponed and
instead a pulmonary angiogram was performed. This revealed no
obvious recurrent pulmonary embolism. The morning
of 10/27/99 , prior to the angiogram , two
events occurred. First event , the patient was walking to the
bathroom and her heart rate was noted to go at 140 beats per minute
and was approximately sinus tachycardia or supraventricular
tachycardia. This resolved after 45 seconds without intervention
and did not recur and there were no associated symptoms and the
patient was unaware of the event. The second event occurred about
one hour later and the patient noted approximately 5/10 sharp right
lower sternal border chest pain which was not pleuritic and not
positional and resolved spontaneously over the next 5 minutes and
did not recur. She also had some abdominal pain. She tolerated p.o.'s without
any gastrointestinal
symptoms throughout and the pain was mild with a benign abdominal
exam. This will be pursued by her outpatient physician , if
indicated. The patient was resumed on Coumadin 10 mg p.o. q. h.s.
as well as Lovenox in the interim 100 mg subcu b.i.d. until she
achieves a therapeutic INR which was determined by Cardiology to be , 3.5 ,
given that she has not
had a recurrent PE. Throughout her stay she remained afebrile and
with a saturation of approximately 94-95 percent on room air ,
breathing comfortably.
FOLLOWUP: She will follow up with her primary care doctor and have
her INR checked in two days.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Cipro heptadine 4 mg p.o. b.i.d.;
Plaquenil 200 mg p.o. q. d.; Coumadin 10 mg
p.o. q. h.s.; Lovenox 100 mg subcu q. 12h..
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged home. She will follow up
with her primary care doctor within one week.

**CONSULTS: ACE , SS , nutrition
**Hospital Course:
CV/I: Patient was sucessfully ruled out by serial enzymes for a
potential myocardial infarction. The patient was continuedon his home ASA ,
statin , and BB during his hospital course. To rule out concern for ischemia
as a role in the deterioration of his cardiomyopathy , a left heart
catheterization was performed which showed worsening CAD from his prior
study 5 years. The patient has 3vd disease with diffuse lesions in his RT
PDA , RT LV-VR , LAD , Lcx. Given the patient's symptoms and echocardiographic
evidence of cardiomyopathy proceeded the progression of his CAD , it is
likely that his arteriosclerosis was not the primary etiology of his
imparied cardiac performance though may be contributing to his disease at
this time.
CV/P: CXR on admission revealed pulmonary edema. The patient had
an excellent reponse to diuresis on lasix and was weaned to room air on
the day after admission. His home blood pressure medications were
continued , and were well controlled. A right heart catheterization was
performed on 6/3 which showed elevated right and left sided filling
pressures , particularly with a Pcw of 24 and mean RA pressure of 5. The
patient was started on Imdur during this admission. His lisinopril was
continued.
Pt CV/R: Patient is undergoing evaulation for ICD. NO ectopy was noted
during full-time telemetric monitoring.
PULM: His OSA was treated with CPAP at 6 cm. No active asthma rx. No
wheezes on exam.
ENDO: Patient was maintained off his oral medications and placed on
insulin alone. On admission , his blood sugars were in the 300s. His Last
A1C was found to be 9.5. While following his blood sugars , his insulin was
titrated up and drug therapy discontinued. He was discharged with BID NPH
insulin to replace his previous med/insulin regimen. WSRH outpatient
diabetes services follow-up will be arranged for the patient.
HEME: On coumadin with admit INR 1.1. Coumadin was held
during admission and patient instructed to discontinue medication as
outpatient considering no hx of afib , LV throbus , or DVT/clot as well as
questions with medication compliance.
F/E/N: Patient was instructed on proper diabetic and HF diet.
PSYCH/SOCIAL: Hx EtOH abuse , last drink day of admit. LFTs were
unremarkable. Patient
also lives with cocaine-using brother hough pt denies use. UTox was
negative. SMC consult provided listing of Spanish AA meetings. Social work
helped arranged a medical bed for patient at home , and to facilitate his
ability to obtain public housing.
The patient was discharged home in stable condition. Followup appts were
arranged with his cardiologist , Dr. Myles Mahnken Also , outpatient diabetes
management followup will be arranged with the patient by the AHMH Endocrine
service. He was also instructed to make an appt with his PCP within two
weeks. VNA
services have been obtained to teach and assist him in this new medication
changes..
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: STOP taking your coumadin.
STOP taking your metformin and gliburide.
CHANGE your insulin to NPH insulin 40 units in the morning and 30 units
before bedtime.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. New stroke , right sided weakness and confusion.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
2. Myasthenia gravis.
3. Osteoarthritis.
4. Pernicious anemia.
5. Hypertension , degenerative joint disease.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right sided weakness and confusion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Benny is an 83 year old woman
with a history of myasthenia gravis ,
arthritis , pernicious anemia and hypertension and degenerative
joint disease with nerve impinging resulting in decreased reflexes
in the left lower extremity. She was in her usual state of health
until when she woke to go to the bathroom at approximately 2 a.m.
on the day of admission. She had difficulty getting up from the
sofa where she sleeps and slipped and fell to her knees. Because
she stated , ""her right leg was weak"". She started speaking and
talking loudly. Her son heard her , came up to help her. At the
time he arrived , she was crawling around on her hands and knees and
appeared to be mildly confused. He helped her up and assisted her
to the bathroom. She was able to walk with assistance and returned
to bed and did not feel like she needed to call a physician at that
time. She then awoke at approximately six in the morning and was
able to walk without assistance to wash her face and then to eat
breakfast. However , at breakfast , the son noted that she was using
her right hand clumsily cutting pieces of banana onto the floor ,
not adequately reaching her mouth to feed herself and had begun to
use her knife to eat her cereal. He discussed the problem with
her. She agreed that she probably needed to call a doctor about
this. She attempted to get out of the chair and again slipped
forward because of right leg weakness. She contacted her physician
who recommended that she be seen at the Troitcape Medical Center
When seen there , when leaving , her son noted that she seemed to run
into things on her right side. With entering the car , did not pick
up her right leg well. At the scboth community hospital , she was found to
have significant right hand weakness and proximal right leg
weakness. She was sent to the Ist Oska Rutl Memorial Health for further evaluation.
She denies having had any previous neurologic events similar to
this episode. She has had an episode of dizziness , nausea and
vomiting associated with a severe right occipital headache back in
8/5 at which time she was evaluated at the Hosch Reathertage Supro Grahot Clinic and was given
diagnosis of benign positional vertigo which since resolved. At
that time , she had a CT scan which showed only periventricular
white matter disease as well as an increased soft tissue density in
the region of the sella. An LP at that time revealed no white
cells and red cells which cleared with successive tubes. She also
six months ago was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis. At that time ,
she had the following symptoms: She had difficulty keeping her
neck up , difficulty swallowing , her eyelids were drooping. These
symptoms resolved quickly with Tensalon injection. She has been
since started on Mestinon and Prednisone with good relief and is
followed by Dr. Kaushiva at Ci Hospital for this problem
and was initially diagnosed by Dr. Gerbatz at Lametizens Health Services .
With regards to her current episode , she denies having any
symptoms of chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting and
palpitations. She has not had any febrile illness , nausea or
vomiting recently. She has not had any episodes of a shade coming
down before her eyes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Myasthenia gravis diagnosed by
Dr. Wilson Pozos at Hermum Medical Center
approximately six months ago. Symptoms as described above , good
relief with Mestinon and Prednisone. 2. Pernicious anemia ,
intrinsic factor antibody positive , receives monthly B12
injections. 3. Spine degenerative joint disease , LS spine CT in
1/11 showed most marked deterioration at the L4-L5 vertebra with
spondylolisthesis , bilateral foraminal narrowing and moderate
spinal stenosis. She has long standing decreased reflexes in her
left leg and some decreased sensation to light touch in her left
foot. 4. Hypertension , has taken Reserpine intermittently over the
last 25 years. She has tolerated this well apparently. This is an
outmoded medication however because she has been on it so long , it
has not been discontinued. However , she has been noted to suffer
from some mild depression. 5. Osteoarthritis affecting mostly the
hands and feet followed by Dr. Hiram Rodrigus at Toncamp Hospital 6. Long standing difficulty sleeping , takes
Phenobarbital 15 mg at night prn for this problem for the last 30
years 7. Frequent UTI's. 8. Episode of benign positional vertigo ,
8/5 as described above. 9. Status post hysterectomy , status post
ovariectomy. 10. Some difficulty with rightward gaze and upward
gaze of the right eye noted as long back as 4/7 11. Hemorrhoids.
12. Right kidney 15 mm simple cyst noted incidentally on the
abdominal CT.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Prednisone 12.5 mg q.o.d. , Daypro 600 mg
q day ( arthritis medication ) , Mestinon 60
mg p.o. q.i.d. , Reserpine 0.25 mg q day and Phenobarbital 15 mg to
30 mg q h.s. ( for sleep ).
FAMILY HISTORY: Father and two brothers died in World War II.
Mother died of a lung problem.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient worked as a lab assistant in the
Co Minbalt for preventative medicine
and later in pathology. She has been retired since 1968 , currently
volunteers at Pua Medical Center in the gift shop on Tuesday
afternoon. She lives with her husband and one son at home.
EXAM: The patient is an elderly appearing woman with a lively
voice and no apparent distress. She gestures much more
with her left hand compared to her right hand. Vital signs: Temp
97.8 , pulse 84 , blood pressure 110/80 , respirations 18. General
exam: HEENT normocephalic atraumatic. Left palpebral fissure is
slightly smaller than right. Throat without erythema. Neck: Good
range of motion. Chest: Faint end-expiratory wheezes , small
crackles at the right base. Coronary: Regular rate and rhythm ,
possible faint systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border , no
carotid bruits. Abdomen: Soft and nontender. Extremities: Joint
deformities most notable in the hands and feet. Joint deformities
in the hands include the distal interphalangeal joints which is
nonconsistent with rheumatoid arthritis , ulnar deviation of the
hand is present. Neuro exam: Mental status alert , oriented to
April , 1995 at *teet Memorial Hospital , Clinton/Gore ,
cannot remember the previous president , picks Reagan. Language:
Fluent and nondysarthric , good repetition , reading and
comprehension , poor word generation but is better in term than
attention. Patient can span five forward , backwards and misses
rely and tune , possibly mild decreased attention. Memory: Fair
for events leading to hospitalization but some difficulty getting
logical sequence of occurrences , may partly be due to language
difficulties. Visual spacial: Clock shows poor organization ,
writes numbers down the middle of the circle. Cranial nerves II:
Right pupil is slightly larger than left pupil , reactive , visual
fields full to confrontation , 3 , 4 , 6 , possible decreased abduction
and vertical upgaze of the right eye. However , she denies double
vision. VII: Smiles symmetrically. Eyebrows symmetric. There is
possibly decreased left nasolabial fold on the left , however , smile
is symmetric. VIII: Hearing intact , finger rubbing bilaterally.
IX , X: Palate is up bilaterally. Turgor of the mouth is 5/5.
Tongue midline. Motor: No drifts , difficulty with fine finger
movement on the right side which is slightly slower than on the
left , has especially more difficulty on the right side initiating
the movements figuring out what to do. Right rapid alternating
movements of the right hand is slightly slower than the left.
Power: Deltoid , biceps and triceps 5/5 , bilaterally symmetric ,
however does not raise her right deltoid as high. Wrist extensors
on the right are 4+/5 and on the left 5/5. Interossei on the right
5-/5 , on the left 5/5. Lower extremities: Iliopsoas , quads , hams
and gastrocs all 5/5 symmetric. EHL possibly slightly diminished
strength on the right. Has increased difficulty with heel to shin
on the right leg probably suggestive of proximal right lower
extremity weakness not apparent on cognition testing. Sensories
and light touch and pinprick are grossly intact throughout. No
double simultaneously stimulation extension , proprioception intact
in the feet bilaterally. Decreased vibration in the left foot
compared to the right foot , reflexes upper extremities 2+
symmetric , lower extremities - right lower extremity 3+ knee , 2+
ankle. Toes downgoing , left , 1+ knee , 1+ ankle , toe downgoing.
Coordination: Finger to nose within normal limits bilaterally.
Heel to shin slightly worse on the right lower extremity , possibly
secondary to proximal flexor weakness. Gait: Walks quickly but
requires holding onto assistants for balance. Incidentally , she
says it is because she needs shoes for arthritis , marked pronation
of the ankle on small steps.
LABS: Sodium 144 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 106 , C02 25 , BUN 15
and creatinine 0.9 , glucose 125 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium
2.0 , B12 was normal. RPR nonreactive. PFT's normal. Phenobarb
level not detected. Tox screen positive for Benzodiazepine ( this
may have been due to sedation she received for the CT. However , it
is not clear that she received sedation ). Hematocrit 34.6 with MCV
of 80.6 , platelets 217 , white count 9.05 , polys 73 , 18 lymphs , 7
monos , 2 eo and 7 basophils. PT 13.1 , PTT 25.7. CT:
Periventricular white matter disease , slightly increased density
above the sella.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is an elderly woman with hypertension ,
myasthenia gravis and arthritis who presented
with weakness of her right lower extremity and right hand and some
confusion as evidenced by using a knife to eat her cereal instead
of a spoon. Her exam was notable for mildly impaired attention ,
possibly confused clock difficulty with handwriting and decreased
strength of the right hand and likely probably decreased strength
to the right lower extremity. Hip flexors is based on the relative
difficulty with heel to shin on the right. Old findings on exam
included abnormalities of the right eye muscles , decreased left
palpebral fissure and sensory findings in the left lower
extremities as well as reflexes. Her presentation was consistent
with possible small vessel stroke affecting the arm and leg more
than the face. This could have occurred in the pons area or the
internal capsule. The component of confusion however is less
explainable based on a deep lesion such as this and raised the
possibility of a small cortical insult. MRI showed no territorial
stroke , just T2 intense abnormalities in the periventricular white
matter , corona radiata and centrum semiovalle suggestive of small
vessel disease. Echo and Holter were not suggestive of
cardioembolic disease. Echo showed normal LV size , preserved LV
function with estimated ejection fraction of 80%. There is also
mild LVH , no thrombus was seen. There was aortic sclerosis with
mildly regurgitation , mild thickening of the mitral valve leaflets
with mild mitral regurgitation and bubble study was negative.
Holter was sinus rhythm at 54 to 127 beats per minute. Occasional
frequent APB's , 14 atrial couplets , five runs of SVT ranging from 3
to 10 beats with heart rates 108 to 182 , occasionally only frequent
VPB's at all hours and one ventricular couplet. Carotid
noninvasive studies showed no significant hemodynamic lesions. Of
note on the MRI , the basilar artery appeared to be small caliber
and the carotid showed some calcification. On carotid noninvasive
studies , however , there was only minimal plaque in the carotid
arteries.
In summary , it appears that Ms. Epperly had a small vessel stroke.
She showed some critical improvement during hospital stay and was
able to walk without assistance on the second hospital day. She
also had improved right hand function and appeared to be less
confused. We recommended starting enteric coated aspirin which she
is to take one per day. In the setting of the acute stroke , we did
not control her blood pressure aggressively. Her pressures ranged
from systolics of 120 to 180 averaging around 140 to 150 with
diastolics usually in the 80's. We have suggested that she
discontinue the use of her Reserpine as intermittent use is
problematic especially with this medication and she admits to
intermittent use as well as the fact that she has suffered from
some mild depression that can be associated with Reserpine. She
will be started on an alternative blood pressure as an out-patient
with Dr. Scotton in the next week. We did not wish to start this
medication in the acute setting. She will likely be started on an
Ace inhibitor for blood pressure control. We also suggested that
she discontinue the use of Phenobarbital for sleep as this might
contribute to confusion.
Finally , since she is on Prednisone and Mestinon , we asked the
patient whether she was taking GI prophylaxis. Evidently , she only
does this intermittently as well. She may be on Carefate , however ,
we suggested taking an H2 blocker once in the evening and have
provided her with the prescription for Zantac 150 mg q h.s. She
will follow-up with Dr. Milosch , her primary doctor at Ni Health as well as Dr. Salmen at the Ont Hospital
for her myasthenia gravis and stroke. She has an appointment with
Dr. Zurovec next week on Wednesday.

Cardiology Broketroit Ma Ri
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Wetterauer is a 54-year-old female
with coronary artery disease status
post inferior myocardial infarction in October of 1997 , with sick
sinus syndrome , status post permanent pacemaker placement , and
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation controlled with amiodarone; also
with history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She was
admitted to the Crotamp Hospital for severe respiratory
distress on 7/10 The summary of clinical events is as follows.
The evening of 7/11 , the patient was having intercourse and
""collapsed."" She was very short of breath with this , and presented
to the Emergency Department via the paramedics. They attempted to
intubate her on the field and found her pulse oxygen to be about 60
percent on bag valve mask. They were unable to do so. She was
described during this episode by her husband as to have been
""gurgling."" She began to describe shortness of breath , and took
her inhalers which did not help. She began to cough quite a bit
and coughed up some frothy white sputum. At the Emergency
Department , she was immediately intubated at Sirose
There was some difficulty intubating her , and she was ultimately
intubated by the attending anesthesiologist there. An
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 25 to 30 percent with
flat CKs. She was diuresed six liters with a stable BUN and
creatinine and was extubated on 10/11 A right heart
catheterization there showed a pulmonary artery pressure of 40/15 ,
wedge of 12 , cardiac output of 5.2. Hemodymanics in the Intensive
Care Unit at Chebanks Hospital indicate the patient's cardiac output
was quite dependent on her SVR. Her cardiac index fell into the
high two's when her SVR was in the 1340 range , but jumped up into
the high three's at about 3.8 when her SVR was much lower down in
the 800s. At the outside hospital , a right upper lobe infiltrate
was also noted and she was given gentamicin 250 mg times one , and
clindamycin 600 mg. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and treated
with clindamycin , this caused resolution of her white count at the
outside hospital. She also had an increase in her Lasix and
lisinopril dose there , as well as her amiodarone. She was started
on Solu-Medrol 40 mg intravenous q.6 hours for possible asthma.
She did quite well after her treatment for pneumonia and treatment
for pulmonary edema , and was transferred to the Misutch University Hospital for further management.
Her last admission was on 2/7 to the Ceter Medical Center
for atypical chest pain , when she had a nondiagnostic exercise
tolerance test. She went 6 minutes and 19 seconds with a maximum
heart rate of 94. Her chest pain then was ultimately attributed to
a gastrointestinal cause.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post inferior
myocardial infarction on 4/27 She was last
admitted , as noted above , on 2/7 to the Lordchild Hospital for atypical
chest pain. The patient has sick sinus syndrome and is status post

Flovent , Solu-Medrol , and amiodarone 300 mg once a day.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a ten pack year smoking history
and quit in 1968. No intravenous drug use. She
is retired from Medical Records at SGH . She has three grown
children and she is married.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission is
significant for a blood pressure of 114/93 ,
this is down from a very high blood pressure on admission at the
outside hospital which was in the 200s. Pulse is 60 , temperature
is 96.5 , saturating 97 percent on two liters. General , this is an
agitated woman in no acute distress. Her neck veins were about 5.0
to 6.0 cm of water. The lung examination showed a few crackles in
the left base with the right one clear. Cardiovascular examination
revealed a split S1 and normal S2 , also a soft S3 , the presence of
a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border
was noted. The abdomen was benign , no hepatosplenomegaly noted.
The extremities showed no edema , with intact distal pulses.
Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented times three with
no focal deficits , but careful neurologic examination was
impossible due to severe agitation and anxiety.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory on admission was significant for a
Troponin of 0.02 , CK of 80 , INR of 1.3 ,
hematocrit of 38.0 , BUN/creatinine of 24/0.6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Digerolamo was admitted to the Aley Coness-o Meoak Medical Center and managed by problems as follows.
Flash Pulmonary Edema: The initial concern for Mrs. Kozicki was of
this being an ischemic event causing her to have flash pulmonary
edema. However , coronary catheterization revealed the patient to
have clean coronaries. Echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular
hypertrophy with a low normal systolic function , with an ejection
fraction of 50 to 55 percent. There was akinesis of the inferior
wall present. She had normal right ventricular size and function.
She had 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation with mild left atrial
enlargement and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation with a regurgitive
velocity of about 2.7 meters per second consistent with minimal
pulmonary systolic pressures. Subsequently the patient was noted
to have had a history of hypothyroidism in the past , and she had
normal TSH recently checked by her primary care physician , Dr.
Slipper , of TCH . However , with no other etiology present , we
were worried about the patient having had tachyarrhythmia from some
other source causing this. The Electrophysiology Service
interrogated the patient's pacer which revealed a number of
tachyarrhythmias. A TSH panel was checked which revealed a TSH of
less than assay , and T4 free thyroxin index elevated. An
Endocrinology consultation was obtained , and they believed that the
patient's thyrotoxicosis was amiodarone induced. She was started
on Tapazole 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. They also suggested prednisone , but
the patient did refuse this. They recommended follow-up with
Endocrine in about four to six weeks. Therefore , the final
etiology for the patient's flash pulmonary edema was amiodarone
induced thyrotoxicosis causing increased susceptibility to
tachyarrhythmia , left ventricular hypertrophy , and possible
diastolic dysfunction , resulting in acute pump dysfunction , causing
flash pulmonary edema. The final therapy for this problem will
consist of heavy nodal blockade. The patient will be blockaded
with calcium channel blockers , as well as Lopressor.
Pneumonia: The patient was treated with clindamycin and did quite
well. Her white count fully resolved and she had no fever or other
symptoms of pneumonia. She will be discharged without any further
antibiotics.
Urinary Tract Infection: She had a lot of uric crystals , therefore
she was placed on Bactrim Double Strength b.i.d. times a total of
seven days.
Psychiatry: The patient has clearly severe anxiety and was in a
full panic attack on admission. She was treated acutely with
Ativan and her problem resolved quite well , and she became more
comfortable in the hospital.
Diabetes Mellitus: Glyburide was held initially on admission. She
was covered with insulin sliding scale. Glyburide was restarted on
the day of discharge. The patient was noted to have relatively
high blood sugars , and these should be followed as an outpatient.
Blood sugars as high as the mid 300s were noted.
Edema: The patient clearly had some fluid accumulation which
resolved with 20 mg of Lasix p.o. q.d. We will continue this and
allow outpatient follow-up to determine whether or not she will
need this in the future.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,
lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Tapazole 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 5.0
mg p.o. q.p.m. , Bactrim Double Strength one tablet p.o. b.i.d.
times four days after discharge , Prempro 0.625/2.5 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol 150 mg
p.o. q.d. , diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. q.d.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in good condition.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Thyrotoxicosis.
FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with Dr. Provins on Monday , 9/18
at 9:30 a.m. , and Dr. Orejel of Chia Memorial Hospital Endocrinology at U Hay Rill , on 7/16 at 3:00

Discharge Date: 5/14/1995
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: INFECTION/RULE OUT ENDOCARDITIS.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1 ) STATUS POST STAPHYLOCOCCUS ENDOCARDITIS
IN March 1995.
2 ) STATUS POST AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT
TIMES THREE WITH ST. JUDE IN April 1995.
3 ) NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65 year old man with a
history of rheumatic heart disease
status post aortic valve replacement times three who suffered acute
bacterial endocarditis ( Staphylococcus aureus , not MRSA ) in 5/26
He presented with nausea , vomiting times one , ""a black out"" ,
weakness , and temperature of 101.2 the morning of admission. This
patient was admitted back on 10/5/95 with fever times five days ,
nasal congestion , and change in mental status. He was found in bed
with fecal incontinence and increased confusion at that time. Back
in October 1995 , the initial TE showed no vegetation. He was
treated with Cefotaxime and Vancomycin. Patient subsequently
developed atrial fibrillation with congestive heart failure and the
hypertension. On October , he was intubated at which time a TE
showed aortic vegetations. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus
aureus and the antibiotics were changed to Oxacillin and
Tobramycin. Patient underwent a high risk redo aortic valve
replacement with St. Jude mechanical valve because of persistent
sepsis. The antibiotics were narrowed to Oxacillin. Patient had a
number of septic embolic events and emboli were thrown to the brain
with a right MCA stroke and the spleen as well as the duodenum. On
2/30 , he had an elevated white count , increasing temperature , and
increasing renal failure. At that time , the CT showed these renal
and splenic abscesses and patient was taken to the Operating Room.
He underwent a splenectomy and was found to have a perforated
duodenal ulcer. He underwent vagotomy with pyeloplasty. The
spleen showed multiple abscesses which grew out Candida. On this
admission , the patient was in his usual state of good health until
one week prior to admission when he experienced fatigue. At
baseline , the patient experienced intermittent sharp chest pain
felt to be musculoskeletal secondary to open thoracic surgery.
Patient also experienced pins and needle feelings felt in both
hands. On the night prior to admission , the patient sneezed
experiencing increased back pain. Later that night , he awoke
diaphoretic with aches and pains in the legs. Patient was sick in
the stomach but believed he would feel better if he ate watermelon
whereupon finishing , he had nausea and vomiting times one. Patient
went back to bed and awoke with joint pain throughout with
temperature at 7 a.m. on 100.1 degrees. Later while sitting in a
chair trying to dress , he stood and things started ""to go black"".
He walked towards the bathroom , got weak , knew he was going down ,
avoided falling down the stairs , and landed on all fours on his
hands and knees. Patient denied head trauma and suffered no
injury. He had no loss of continence or seizure activity. Patient
got up and moved to the bathroom under his own power. He had a
small bowel movement and felt better. Wife returned home and
temperature at 9 a.m. was 101.2. Patient was taken to Ertj. Health Urgent Care Center. At CTACH , he received blood cultures times
two and blood tests before being brought to the Gra Forro Memorial Hospital Emergency Room. Patient denied any recent cough , sore
throat , dysuria , and hematuria but did note increased nasal
congestion and shortness of breath over the past month.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) History of rheumatic heart disease with
aortic valve replacement times three in
3/26 , 1981 , and 5/26 2 ) Acute Staphylococcus aureus bacterial
endocarditis with septic emboli to brain , kidney , and spleen in
6/8 3 ) Status post splenectomy and Candida cultured out. 4 )
Duodenal ulcer status post resection and gastrectomy with vagotomy.
5 ) Status post multiple cerebrovascular accidents. 6 ) Low back
pain. 7 ) Vertigo on Meclizine. 8 ) Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
9 ) Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 10 ) Paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Beclovent and Ventolin puffers , Lopressor 25
mg b.i.d. , Glyburide 2.5 mg q.d. , Hytrin 5 mg
q.h.s. , Senokot two tablets b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , and
Coumadin 4 alternating with 5 mg q.p.m.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin caused a rash.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Tobacco of three packs per day times thirty years
and alcohol quit fifteen years ago. The patient
was unemployed on disability , he was a painter's rigger , and
married times 24 years with four children from his first wife , now
living with his second wife.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient's temperature was 101.6 , blood
pressure 96/60 , pulse 88 , and respirations
28. HEENT: Pupils were equal and reactive to light and
accommodation , extraocular muscles were intact , normal funduscopic
examination , no Roth spots were noted , the oropharynx was benign ,
and no petechiae were noted. NECK: Supple and there was no
lymphadenopathy , his jugular venous distention was absent , an EJ
line was in place , and there was a 2+ carotid with zero bruits.
CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Regular rate
and rhythm , S1 and S2 , and there was a holosystolic II/VI systolic
murmur at the left sternal border with no S3 or S4 noted. There
was a very crisp click from the St. Jude aortic valve. ABDOMEN:
Examination showed positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , and
non-distended. RECTAL: Refused by patient. NEUROLOGICAL:
Examination showed that the patient was alert and oriented times
three , cranial nerves II-XII were intact , motor was 5/5 in all four
extremities distally and proximally , sensory was normal to light
touch and proprioception , and the reflexes were equal and
symmetric. Cerebellar was slow , equal repetitive motions , and the
F&F was slow but equal with good tracking grossly.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Of note , his white count was 19.1 with 18
bands and 53 polys , hematocrit was 41.8 ,
and the electrolytes were all within normal range. The bilirubins
were 0.8 total , alkaline phosphatase 82 , SGPT of 15 , and his PT was
20.7 with an INR of 3.4. A transthoracic echo obtained upon
admission showed the aortic valve was in place , there was a 2.9
meters per second flow through the aortic valve , and there was no
abscess or vegetation noted. Patient had reportedly gotten two
blood cultures in Ari Norer Legulf Hospital and it turned out later that there
had only been one blood draw. One blood culture was also drawn in
the Emergency Room at the Thoter Coast Community Healthcare . Chest
x-ray showed cardiomegaly , no infiltrate , and no congestive heart
failure and his EKG at admission showed normal sinus rhythm at 89
with an axis of minus 20 , intervals were 0.26/0.90/0.36 , there was
a flipped T in lead I , aVL , V5 , and V6 , and there was first degree
AV block.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 65 year old gentleman who had had three
aortic valve replacements and had suffered
overwhelming endocarditis as recently as six months ago in the
replaced St. Jude valve at that time with a high risk valve since
patient was known to be febrile at the time of valve replacement.
Therefore , the number one problem was to rule out endocarditis.
The patient had two blood cultures , one at the Acraw Medical Center and one
at Ter'svenwhi Rywick Hospital , which were negative times 48 hours
while the patient was maintained on Vancomycin and Gentamicin. It
was judged that a TE would not change our treatment for this
gentleman and it was not obtained. An Infectious Disease
consultation was obtained and Infectious Disease recommended
observing the patient on antibiotics for an extra 24 hours before
deeming him non-bacteremic and then to observe the gentleman off
antibiotics for 24 hours before discharging him. In regards to
anti-coagulation , the patient was targeted for an INR of 3 with a
high risk prosthetic heart valve. This was easily maintained using
the patient's normal alternating 4 and 5 mg q.p.m. Coumadin. Final
issue was the patient's fall. It was judged that the patient
actually became weak and went down on all fours controlling his
fall without actual syncope. The weakness could be attributed to
the patient's nausea , vomiting , dehydration , and vasovagal. Final
issue was the non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. While the
patient was hospitalized , the Glyburide was held and patient was
maintained on a sliding scale of insulin. Patient's blood cultures
remained negative times three days while patient was treated with
Vancomycin and Gentamicin. As per Infectious Disease
recommendations , the intravenous antibiotics were held on the third
day and then patient was observed for 24 hours off antibiotics. He
continued to remain afebrile through the entire hospitalization and
patient was discharged to home on September .
DISPOSITION: Disposition is to home.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. headache ,
Ventolin two puffs inhaled b.i.d. ,
Beclovent two puffs inhaled b.i.d. , Beconase two puffs inhaled
q.i.d. p.r.n. congestion , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Meclizine 25
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Senokot tablets two
tablets p.o. q.a.m. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.o.d. alternating with 5
mg p.o. q.o.d. , every day , patient took either 4 or 5 alternating ,
and Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. Patient was not discharged on any
antibiotics.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
FOLLOW-UP: Arranged with his attending , Dr. Andre Raju for the
following week. Patient was also arranged to have an
MRI scan of his spine on Wednesday , 6/6 , at noon. This is to
rule out possibilities of osteomyelitis since patient had had low
back pain since septic events of 5/26

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Chest pain
HPI: 69y/o female w/ MMP , including CHF ( EF=50% 10/6/04 ) , NIDDM , Afib ,
and mult CVAs , was in her USOH until 8am the DOA , when she was observed
to have twitches in her eyes and mouth; during this episode , the pt.
was A&OX3/no LOC. Per report , she has not had these sx previously. VS
at the time were stable. At 8:45 am per report , the pt began moaning
and complained of left sided chest pain localized to her breast. Her
skin was noted to be clammy. The pt. reports no radiation of sx , SOB ,
N/V , palpitations , or dizziness. Proxy did note that pt had a
""congestive cough"" for past week. VS at nursing home durnig episode of
chest pain were P57-92 , BP 104/70 , O2 98%RA. Pt then brought to the RMH
ED , where she no longer c/o sx but was found to be tachy in afib w/
HR 120s-130s. In ED VS: T 99.2; BP 129/116; RR14; O2 99%RA. PE notable
for cataracts b/l , CN intact , lungs CTA b/l , CVS tachy , ?S4 , abd s/nt ,
ext www , no edema. Pt. unable to cooperate for full neurological exam.
Labs notable for K of 5.4 , Ca of 8.1 , and WCT of 15.02. EKG:tachy at
111 , reg rhythm ?sinus vs. atrial flutter. .5mm ST depression in V5 , no
TW changes , QW in 3 , aVF ( unchanged ). CXR: No evidence of pulm edema/
infiltrate. Pt given 50 mg PO lopressor and 5mg IV lopressor X 4 w/
persistent tachycardia to the low 100s.
ASSESSMENT: 69 y/o female with h/o CHF , DM , tachyarrhythmias , and CVAs
presents w/ chest pain , facial twitching. Pt admitted for stabilization
of HR and r/o MI.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1 ) CARDS:
Ischemia: Pt ruled out by enzymes/EKG X3. Did not complain of CP/ SOB
during admission. On ASA , Beta blocker
Pump: H/o CHF w/ EF 50-55% in 7/19/04. No evidence of volume overload
by PE , CXR. On lasix 20 mg po qd. Repeat ECHO 11/8/04 showed a mild
interval reduction in LV EF down to 35-40% without significant
valvular abnormalities.
Rhythm: Pt tachy to 110s on admission but hemodynamically stable. O/N
HD1 had episode of afib at 130s-140s , desat to 88%. No complaints of
CP. Given diltiazem 10 mg IV w/ return of HR to low 100s ( baseline ).
Started diltiazem 30 mg po QID w/ drop in HR to 70s-80s , w/ irregular
rhythm. Per EKG , ?sinus arrhythmia vs ?atrial fibrillation w/ normal
rate. TSH pending. On HD4 , pt. had episode of bradycardia down to 50s
( approximately 1 hour ) asymptomatic with no evidence of heart block.
Toprol XL was restarted at home dose ( 100 mg qd ) , and diltiazem was
kept at qid dosing upon discharge. Given the brief episode of
bradycardia and concerns for both bradycardia and heart block , it was
decided to place a continuous loop monitor on the patient. She will
follow up in outpatient cardiology on November and with her PCP on
November
2 ) NEURO: Has hx of CVA. Head CT on 8/17/04 shows old infarct , no new
lesion. Per proxy , pt. back to baseline mental status upon admission.
No episodes of facial twitching during admission. On aricept.
3 ) ID: WCT 15.03 w/ 86% PMNs. Pt afebrile , no evidence of infection.
Given hx. of cough , a sputum gs/cx were done and were negative. WCT
down to 8.03 by discharge. Pt. on prednisone for temporal arteritis;
this may have been the cause of the WCT elevation , but this is
unlikely as WCT dropped by discharge.
4 ) ENDO: On metformin 850 mg BID for DM. In addition , had pt. on
sliding scale insuling during admission.
5 ) FEN: Potassium initially elevated , but down to 3.8 by discharge; No
EKG changes were observed. Ca was low , and was repleted - it may have
been responsible for facial twitches. On ADA diet.
6 ) RHEUM: H/o temporal arteritis. Continued prednisone 10mg qd. ESR
rechecked on day of discharge per Dr. Newberg To be followed up
as outpatient.
7 ) CODE: FC. *Per Health proxy , Jackie Bhatia ( phone
857-284-3232 ) , pt's code status had changed to FC after being years of
DNR/DNI. Code status was revisited this hospitalization , and Ms.
Points requested that the pt. be full code. Discussed issue
with Dr. Ollhoff , who will revisit this issue with the patient and
proxy at her next appt.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please continue to take your home medications. We have added a new
medication , Diltiazem , which you need to take four times a day. In
two days , you should receive a portable heart monitor that will record
your heart rhythms continuously for one month.
Please schedule an appt. to see Dr. Mclaine within 1 week. You should see
Dr. Waylon Back in cardiology on November at 1:30 p.m. and Dr.
Guariglia on June at 1:50 p.m. If you have chest pain , shortness
of breath , dizziness , weakness , or other symptoms go to the ER.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Pt. to follow up with Dr. Peloquin on 9/17/04 at 3:50 p.m. For HR
control , pt. started on diltiazem 30 mg QID. Will likely transition to
long-acting diltiazem as an outpatient. Pt has been scheduled to see
Dr. Mcgrue in cardiology for consideration of amio for heart rate
control. Pt to be sent home with loop monitor for possible
bradycardia/heart block on nodal agents.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Peluso is an 88-year-old male
with chronic atrial fibrillation , CAD and aortic stenosis since
1989 and being followed by a cardiologist in Prora who
presented to Stem,delfgilm Hospital in Nah Coton- An on 9/27/06 with chest pain
and shortness breath. Until 3/22 , he had been feeling generally
well without limiting dyspnea , fatigue , or chest pain. Since
then he has had two inpatient admissions in Hay Irv Co for
CHF. He complains of marked increase in dyspnea on exertion and
fatigue as well as PND/nocturia for the past three to four
months. He developed chest pressure and shortness of breath in
early morning of 9/27/06 and was subsequently brought by EMS to
Ara Nonter Memorial During admission , verapamil and isosorbide were
discontinued and he was started on low-dose beta-blocker. He was
also given diuretics for CHF with net 3 L negative balance. He
was also ruled out for acute myocardial infarction. His echo
showed critical aortic stenosis with a valve area 0.44 sq cm , EF
of 55% , moderate MR with valve area 3 sq cm with TR and moderate
pulmonary hypertension. He was then transferred to SH for
cardiac catheterization and possible valvuloplasty.
PREOPERATIVE CARDIAC STATUS: Elective. The patient presented
with critical coronary anatomy/valve dysfunction. There is a
history of class III heart failure. Recent signs and symptoms of
congestive heart failure include paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea/dyspnea on exertion/pulmonary edema on chest x-ray/pedal
edema. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. The patient has a
history of atrial fibrillation/flutter treated with drugs/beta
blocker.
PREVIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS: Cardiac cath in 1981
reportedly with 40% lesion in an unknown vessel.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Wide excision of melanoma in 1980.

SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: No issues.
Cardiovascular: No issues. On aspirin , Lopressor , and Coumadin.
Respiratory: No issues. Have been extubated on postop day #2.
GI: N.p.o. Video swallow showed aspiration. Nutrition will
continue to follow with recommendations.
Renal: No issues.
Endocrine: No issues.
Hematology: Anticoagulated with aspirin and Coumadin. Recent
mitral valve repair/atrial fib.
ID: No issues.
Of note , recent video swallow , the patient needs Dobbhoff tubes
for meds p.o. until Nutrition gives further Rx.
On the Step-Down Unit , starting postop day #3 , no narcotics. An
88-year-old status post circ arrest confused , impulsive and on
sitter , Pacing wire remains in place.
On postop day #4 , rate controlled A fib , hypertensive , added
low-dose captopril to Lopressor 12.5 q.i.d. , diuresing well ,
remains on 1.5 L O2 , strict n.p.o. for aspiration per Speech and
Swallow. On tube feeds via Dobbhoff , confusion improving , no
narcotics/sedatives. UA sent for MS changes , negative for UTI.
Wires discontinued. Coumadin for A fib. Rehabilitation
screening initiated.
On postop day #5 , rate controlled A fib , Coumadin. BP still
hypertensive , increased captopril to 12.5 t.i.d. Ambulating with
PT on room air. Dobbhoff in place. All meds/nutrition via
Dobbhoff. Postop echo ordered for MVP. Off sitters today , clear
mental status. No narcotics/sedatives. UA clean.
On postop day #6 , rate controlled A fib. BP improved on
captopril. Cards following , recommending to preferentially
increase Lopressor and decrease captopril as tolerated. Of note ,
the patient has been quite hypertensive this week with heart rate
well controlled even low-dose Lopressor. Increased Lopressor to
25 mg q.i.d. , captopril 12.5 t.i.d. Creatinine 0.4 , has diuresed
well. Postop echo with an EF of 45% to 50% , moderate LVH ,
hypokinetic anterior septal and inferior wall , normal RV. Severe
LAE and RAE , paravalvular leak seen at AVR with mild AI , trace
MR , mild TR. Also has large left pleural effusion , was seen on
echo. Only small bilateral effusions were seen on chest x-ray.
The patient's main issue now is PT and Speech and Swallow
reassessment. Dobbhoff was repositioned today for tube in
stomach with tip newly pointing upwards into the esophagus.
Post-repositioning KUB shows tip now downwards in stomach. Given
some Reglan to advance. Clear mental status. Junky cough cannot
produce sputum for sample. Afebrile. White count 9.8.
Nutrition and EMS Rx followed , has recovered very well ,
ambulating on room air.
On postop day #7 , repeat video swallow scheduled for Monday.
Coumadin started. Coumadin continued and started Plavix for LAD
endarterectomy , off aspirin. Possible PEG placement pending
video swallow results. Repeat chest x-ray with minimal left
effusion.
On postop day #8 , holding Coumadin for possible PEG next week
pending video swallow on Monday. No heparin for now per Dr.
Ernesto Umbel
On postop day #9 , tube feeds off at midnight , getting repeat
video swallow on a.m. for speech and swallow. Holding Coumadin ,
which was given for chronic A fib pending possible PEG placement.
On postop day #10 , A fib/room air. Video swallow study showed
improvement , but patient still silently aspirating. Speech and
swallow recommends PEG and continued work with Speech and Swallow
for eventual goal of patient taking p.o.'s. Contacted Metabolic
Support. They will send someone to evaluate the patient for PEG ,
so the procedure will likely take place on Wednesday or Thursday.
On postop day #11 , A fib/room air , feeding tubes were part way
out , readvanced and got KUB showing good placement. Metabolic
support evaluated the patient , got consent for PEG.
On postop day #12 , A fib/room air , holding tube feeds and
Coumadin for PEG placement , scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday. No
heparin per Dr. Christman May go to rehab once INR therapeutic for
A fib. The patient had a four-beat run of VT.
On postop day #13 , he was supposed to have PEG placed today.
Metabolic support said that someone called the OR desk yesterday
and canceled the procedure , so it was rescheduled for Tuesday due
to no OR availability. Otherwise , the patient was supposed to
have repeat video swallow next week. Hemodynamically stable.
Holding Coumadin. Rehabilitation when ready.
On postop day #14 , PEG tube placement rescheduled for next
Tuesday , giving low-dose Coumadin for A fib , at goal tube feeds
through Dobhoff , hemodynamically stable.
On postop day #15 , doing well. General surgery consult called to
try and get PEG placed earlier the next Tuesday. Dr. Len Dechart will do it either tomorrow or Monday at the latest.
Otherwise , doing well , n.p.o. after midnight. Hopefully , he will
get PEG and can go to rehabilitation.
On postop day #16 , tube feeding restarted. PEG placement
tomorrow. Otherwise , doing well , rate controlled A fib.
Rehabilitation once PEG tube placed.
On postop day #17 , finally received peg today , currently on D5 in
a half at 50 mL an hour , okay to give meds through PEG and can
restart tube feeds tomorrow. NG tube out. Coumadin to restart
tonight. PT/rehabilitation screening.
On postop day #18 , started tube feeds this morning , advancing
rate without difficulty. The patient ambulating with assistance ,
rate controlled A fib/2 L O2 stable. Plan to rehab tomorrow.
The patient was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery Service to be stable
to discharge to rehabilitation on postop day #19 with the
following discharge instructions.

ATTENDING: LINAHAN , OMER M.D.
PRINCIPLE ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Bacteremia , peri-sepsis and
apnea.
PRINCIPLE DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Bacteremia , peri-sepsis and
apnea , as well as failure to tolerate p.o. diets.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: He is an 81-year-old man primarily
Russian-speaking , with a history of multiple medical problems
including coronary artery disease status post an MI in 2004 as
well as a cath at the same time with percutaneous intervention ,
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45-50% ,
atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation and a partial pacemaker
for sick sinus syndrome , multiple strokes x4 , diabetes mellitus
type 2 and COPD , who was recently admitted to the Ghampemaw A Hospital for
bacteremia with Streptococcus oralis without a clear source. His
white blood cell count had increased to 20. His INR had been
supratherapeutic on admission at that time to 14. At that time ,
he had had a transesophageal echocardiogram which did not show
any vegetations and he was discharged to rehab on 3/15/06 with a
course of IV penicillin through a PICC line , as well as oral
Flagyl empirically for an elevated white count. At the rehab
facility where he was placed , the patient was found to have
pulled his PICC line and the patient was complaining of being
short of breath and having some mental status changes. He was
treated with some sublingual nitroglycerin at the outside
facility and brought to the Ellwis Medical Center Emergency Room , where a chest
x-ray showed some lack of the PICC line and the short of breath
quickly improved in the emergency room. He was , however ,
lethargic and then at times , apneic in the emergency room. A gas
was performed which showed respiratory alkalosis with a pH of
7.5 , a pCO2 of 34 and a pAO2 of 135. The patient then became
slightly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures to the 90s ,
was given IV fluid boluses as well as treated empirically with
vancomycin and ceftazidime , to which his blood pressure responded
by going up to around 100-110/60. Given his apnea , a CPAP was
initiated in the emergency department and his oxygenation issues
quickly resolved. A head CT was performed , which was negative.
A right internal jugular line was placed and gentle rehydration
therapy according to early goal-directed therapy for peri-sepsis
was initiated , given the presumption of repeat bacteremia and
early sepsis. He was admitted to medicine for further
management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post MI in
2004 and a cath in 2005. He is status post a hip fracture in
2005. He has peripheral vascular disease , diabetes , COPD but not
reported to be on any home oxygenation , dementia , Paget disease ,
atrial fibrillation , BPH , congestive heart failure , EF of 45-50% ,
hypertension , diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included the following: Glucotrol 10 mg
p.o. b.i.d. and lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day , metformin 500 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. x10 days which was started
on 5/5/06 , sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n. , nystatin suspension
q.i.d. , Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.o. q. h.s. , Penicillin G 3 million units
IV q. 4h x7 days , Milk of Magnesia , Tylenol p.r.n. , Dulcolax
p.r.n. , Colace p.r.n. , atenolol 50 mg q. day , Lipitor 20 mg q.
day , Senna liquid q. h.s. , Flomax 0.4 q. day.
ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a history of heavy tobacco use. He quit
40 years ago. He lives at home with a 24-hour attendant and he
rarely uses alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM notable for the following: His
temperature was 95.9 , his heart rate was 60 , his blood pressure
was 110/62. He is satting 98% on a CPAP machine. In general , he
was in no acute distress in restraints. His head and neck exam
was notable for a supple neck. Pupils are equal , round and
reactive. His heart demonstrated a regular rate and rhythm. His
JVP was flat. He did not demonstrate any murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. His pulmonary exam was clear anteriorly. His abdominal
exam was noted for being soft , nontender , and nondistended with
positive bowel sounds and mild tympani. He had good peripheral
pulses with trace lower extremity edema. His neuro exam was
nonfocal.
OPERATIONS: During his hospital stay at this time included a PEG
tube placement which happened on 10/25/06.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. ID: The patient has a history of recent strep oralis
bacteremia and leukocytosis. He was afebrile at the time of
admission; however , given concern for possible early sepsis given
his blood pressure , he was treated with empiric IV fluids and
antibiotics with vancomycin and ceftazidime. His chest x-ray
looked like it might have some aspiration and he was treated with
an empiric 7-day course of Ceptaz and Flagyl for aspiration
pneumonia. This course was completed earlier in his hospital
stay. He was also initially treated with vancomycin. A PICC was
placed on 8/7/06 for further antibiotic management of his
bacteremia. His vancomycin was switched to IV penicillin and
this will be continued for a full 3-4 week course on 1/15/07. A
TEE was considered unnecessary given the fact that he was going
to be treated anyway with antibiotics for 4 weeks. All blood ,
urine , sputum cultures and stool cultures remained no growth to
date at the time of discharge.
2. Pulmonary: As mentioned above , the patient demonstrated some
apnea in the Emergency Department which resolved with CPAP;
however , given the fact that the patient was a significant
aspiration risk , a CPAP was considered unnecessary and possibly
would increase the risk of aspiration. Pulmonary was consulted ,
who felt that the patient was demonstrating Cheyne-Stokes
respirations secondary to possible CHF or history of CVAs that he
has had in the past. His ABG , as I mentioned above , demonstrated
respiratory alkalosis with a mild metabolic alkalosis as well.
His repeat ABG showed no significant change , which likely
indicates a chronic process. He did not demonstrate any PEs on
studies that were performed here. No pneumonia was noted and the
desaturations that were detected while the patient was sleeping
overnight on 15 units O2 sat monitor resolved quickly with 2
liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. A plan was made to not
reinitiate CPAP given the aspiration risk. He was initially
diuresed mildly with Lasix. This was eventually discontinued.
The patient should receive nighttime supplemental oxygen ,
particularly if he desaturates to less than 90%.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient is status post an MI , status
post PCI in 2004. His enzymes were negative on this admission
and a repeat EKG was unchanged from previous. The patient was
restarted on his home doses of aspirin , statin , beta blocker 2
pump. The patient's ejection fraction was 45-50% with inferior
wall hypokinesis. Hypotension improved on admission , restarted
his beta blocker and his ACE inhibitor and IV fluids at the time
of discharge. Re the patient's history of a-fib , he was in
normal sinus rhythm for the majority of his hospital stay.
Coumadin was held peri-procedure when he was getting his PEG
placed and vitamin K had been administered in view of his
supratherapeutic Coumadin. His Coumadin should be restarted on
2/18/07. Of note as well for rhythm issues , the patient was
kept on potassium and magnesium scales while in hospital and he
has a partial pacemaker placed for his sick sinus syndrome.
4. GI: The patient had a history of constipation. His abdomen
was tympanitic when he first presented. He was given a bowel
regimen and has subsequently begun making good solid stool.
Midway through his hospital course , the patient developed trouble
with eating. He had multiple NG tubes placed which he was
self-discontinuing requiring urgent reconsideration of more
permanent feeding tubes. A discussion was held between our
service and the GI team , who felt that a PEG would be useful for
managing this patient's feeding in the future. On 10/1/06 , GI
endoscopically placed a PEG tube for future feeding. Nutrition
was consulted and tube feeds were re-initiated that evening.
Again , his Coumadin will be held until 9/14/07 so as to promote
appropriate wound healing around the site of the PEG placement.
5. Heme: The patient had a history of anemia but did not
demonstrate any acute hematocrit drops. His INR on admission was
1.9. We had transiently restarted Coumadin but he will have to
restart that again on 9/14/07 , given the fact that it was held
for his PEG placement. He was continued on iron supplements
during his hospital stay.
6. Renal: The patient , as discussed above , has demonstrated a
respiratory alkalosis with a mild metabolic alkalosis as well.
His creatinine was mildly elevated which is secondary to chronic
renal insufficiency for unclear reasons. His creatinine by the
time of discharge had improved dramatically to 0.7.
7. Endocrine: The patient's oral hypoglycemics were held during
this hospital stay. He was started on insulin sliding-scale and
Lantus. As his feeding has increased and his tube feeds have
reached goal , his Lantus has had to be titrated up. He is
currently at 15 units q. p.m. He may need more while at the
facility that he is going to.
8. GU: The patient has a history of vesiculous spermatocele or
hydrocele , which is going to be followed by urology as an
outpatient. We had held his Flomax initially given low blood
pressure but we restarted it during his hospital stay here.
9. FEN: As mentioned above , the patient is on aspiration
precautions secondary to speech and swallow evaluation that was
consistent with aspiration. NG tubes were placed multiple times
but were self-discontinued by the patient. Finally , a PEG tube
was placed on 3/2 and tube feeds were reinitiated that evening.
10: Psych: The patient has a history of being mildly agitated.
Zyprexa was initiated here at home doses of 2.5 mg q. day and
then titrated up to 2.5 mg b.i.d. The patient has responded very
nicely to this and is no longer agitated.
11. Prophylaxis: He was kept on TEDS and P-boots. Coumadin as
mentioned above will need to be restarted on 9/14/07 and Nexium
was to continue while he is here.

Discharge Date: 3/23/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HEMOPTYSIS.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS:
1. SINUSITIS.
2. STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old gentleman
status post cardiac transplant ( 11/27 )
who was transferred to the Nasstrict Hospital Of with a
history of hemoptysis.
The patient underwent cardiac transplantation in 1991 for severe
ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient had a rather unremarkable
course except for the development of some graft CAD ( seen on last
catheterization ). The patient was admitted from 11/17/96 to
6/24/96 with a two month history of sputum production. The
patient was empirically started on IV cefotaxime and his
cyclosporine was adjusted up to 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient's
shortness of breath and respiratory problems subsequently resolved.
A CT of the chest showed prior granulomatous involvement of the
lung and spleen. The patient had AFB times three done: all
negative. The patient did have Mycobacterium avium grow out in his
sputum; however , this organism was not felt to be a pathogen for
him. After the patient was discharged , the patient continued
continued to have persistent ear fullness and pain , and a thick ,
but clear , nasal discharge. Then , approximately one week ago , the
patient noted increasing cough. The patient denies any associated
fevers or chills. On the day prior to admission , the patient noted
his sputum was blood tinged. The patient subsequently coughed up
approximately one quarter cup of bright red blood , which was
apparently witnessed in the Emergency Room at the outside hospital.
The patient apparently had some more hemoptysis ( amount not
documented ) on the night of admission; however , the patient has not
had any further hemoptysis since then ( approximately 20 hours ).
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Status post cardiac transplantation in
1991 ( secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy ).
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 3. Status post coronary
artery bypass graft. 4. Status post a left ventral hernia repair.
5. Status post a right ankle fracture. 6. Status post goring by
bull in 1987. 7. Liver laceration. 8. Hypertension. 9. Peripheral
vascular disease.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Cyclosporine 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2.
Cardizem CD 180 mg p.o. q.day. 3. Imuran
175 mg p.o. q.h.s.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife in Jo The patient was a janitor until 1/19 The
patient smoked a half pack per day times 30 years. The patient
drinks only socially ( occasionally ).
FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a myocardial infarction at age 78.
Mother alive , but has diabetes mellitus ,
congestive heart failure , and coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On vitals , temperature was 97.9 , blood
pressure 160/100 , heart rate 106 ,
respirations 20 , and O2 saturation 96% on two liters. The patient
is an elderly gentleman lying in his bed in no acute distress.
HEENT examination was normocephalic , atraumatic. Pupils were
equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular
muscles were intact. There was no lymphadenopathy. JVP was
approximately 7 cm , with no carotid bruits. Cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. Abdomen had positive bowel sounds , obese ,
nontender , and nondistended. Extremities had 2+ bilateral lower
extremity edema. Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: SMA-7 was notable for glucose 284 , creatinine
1.2. CBC revealed a white count of 4 , hematocrit
35.2 , and platelets 191 , 000. PT was 13 , PTT 28.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient had no hemoptysis throughout his
Mo Hospital hospitalization.
The patient was scheduled for , and underwent , bronchoscopy on
4/3/96 , which revealed bronchiectasis of the anterior segment of
the left lower lobe ( where the CT abnormalities were seen ).
Purulent secretions were also encountered and sent for appropriate
cultures and tests. No evidence of malignancy was seen. The
Pulmonary team did recommend starting the patient on appropriate
antimicrobial coverage for MAI. Therefore , the patient was started
on clarithromycin and ethambutol. Given that these medications
effect the liver cytochrome P450 system , the patient's cyclosporine dose
required adjustment downward to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. to keep his levels
200-300. The patient also underwent CT scan of his maxillofacial
area on 9/12/96. This scan revealed air levels in both maxillary
sinuses , as well as the sphenoid sinuses. Subtotal opacification
was seen in most of the ethmoid air cells. Also , subtotal
opacification of the mastoid air cells was demonstrated
bilaterally. The frontal sinuses appeared minimally developed; of
the few air cells present , there was complete opacification. The
overall impression was pain and sinus disease with left
otomastoiditis. The patient underwent further evaluation in the
ENT Clinic on 7/24/96 ; their recommendations included Biaxin times
four weeks ( the patient will be on this medication for at least
four weeks for coverage of MAI ). The Infectious Disease team
recommends that the patient's repeat AFBs be followed up and , if
they are followed up , clarithromycin and ethambutol could be
stopped after six weeks versus 18-24 months of therapy. The
Pulmonary team also recommended that the patient be started on
Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers and have a set of pulmonary
function tests obtained as an outpatient. It is also recommended
that the patient be started on a cholesterol lowering agent at his
next Transplant Clinic visit ( LDL came back at 151 after patient's
discharge ).
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Procardia XL 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
cyclosporine 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , ethambutol
1 , 500 mg p.o. q.day , Atrovent metered dose inhaler two puffs
q.i.d. , Imuran 175 mg p.o. q.h.s. , clarithromycin 500 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Afrin two sprays n.a. b.i.d. times three days , and Ocean
Spray two sprays n.a. q.day.
CONDITION: Fair.
DISPOSITION: To home , follow up appointment in the Transplant
Clinic on 8/26/96 ; the patient also instructed to
arrange a follow up appointment with Dr. Gullace ( Pulmonary ). The
patient should have cyclosporine levels monitored carefully ,
especially over the next week or two.

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
59 year-old right-handed woman admitted for suspected acute stroke. Her
PMH includes HTN , hypercholesterolemia , prior TIA vs. stroke 10/26
( manifest as slurred speech , left arm and leg weakness ). prior
myocardial infarction ( 1984 ) , and history of left Bell's palsy x 3 with
chronic weakness of facial expression muscles on the left. She had a
possible patent foramen ovale with agitated saline contrast passage on
valsalva maneuver TTE when she was admitted 11/25 for stroke work-up.
Recently , this woman has had 2-weeks of general fatigue , exertional dys
pnea , frequent headaches , and intermittent blurred vision while driving
followed by a 2-3 second episode of binocular visual loss 4/13/03.
Notably , she ran out of amlodipine and reports obtaining a level of
240/150 on self-monitoring. One day prior to admission she saw her PCP
who noted hypertension and referred her to an ophthalmologist , who
obtained a normal exam by report.
She awoke this morning with a more severe right frontal headache with
pain radiating to the right shoulder. She also experienced a problem
with gait , leaning to the right. Her husband phoned EMS because she had
a severe headache and seemed ""confused."" At present , the patient denies
headache and confusion , as well as diplopia , vertigo , dysphagia , and
dysarthria. She denies recent chest pain , but has had orthopnea.
PMHx: hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , prior TIA versus stroke ,
prior myocardial infarction ( 1984 ) , obstructive sleep apnea , recurrent
left Bell's palsy , allergic rhinitis , chronic renal insufficiency
( baseline creatinine around 1.5 )
Meds: ASA 81 , HCTZ , atenolol , amlodipine , atorvastatin , loratadine , PRN

All: iodinated contrast , losartan
VS: T 97.2 HR 57 BP 150/90
GEN obese woman , comfortable HEENT sclerae anicteric , oral mucosa moist
NECK: no bruits
HEART mild bradycardia , regular rhythm , II/VI SEM at USB ABD soft ,
nontender , nondistended EXT: no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema; radial
and dorsalis pedis pulses 2+
NEURO: MS significant for no deficits on orientation , attention , langua
ge , memory , and praxis. CN exam significant for right hypertropic skew ,
left facial droop , mostly lower face but with weak eyebrow raise as
well. Motor exam with normal tone , no pronator drift , strength 5/5 in
all muscle groups in upper and lower extremities. Coordination exam
with slightly slowed fine finger movements , right hand , normal
performance on finger-nose-finger and heel-knee-shin , sensory exam
without deficits in light touch , temperature , vibratory sensation ,
reflexes 2 throughout except for 1 in the ankles , toes downgoing
bilaterally. GAIT slightly wided based but stable gait with upright
posture , normal arm-swing. No difficulty with heel , or toe walk. Falls
to left on tandem gait.
Non-contrast head CT negative for evidence of stroke or hemorrhage.
Hospital course: the pt was admitted with hypertension and recent
headaches , visual changes ( blurred vision ) , change in gait ( inability
to walk in heels ) , and recent confusion. Neurologic exam was
significant for right hypertropic skew without diplopia , left facial
weakness that is old per pt and LMR notes , mild slowing of right fine
finger movements , and tendency to fall towards the left on tandem gait.
These findings do not localize well and the differential diagnosis
was felt to include cerebral ischemia/infarction and hypertensive
encephalopathy. The patient had recent poorly-controlled
hypertension as well as symptoms of possible heart failure including
exertional dyspnea and orthopnea.
An MRI was ordered to evaluate for possible stroke or hypertensive
encephalopathy. Unfortunately , the pt was not able to tolerate the
procedure , citing claustrophobia from a traumatic childhood experience
as a prohibitive factor. Her atenolol was continued and she was placed
on aspirin 325 mg qd for stroke and heart prophylaxis. Her blood
pressures remained well-controlled throughout admission and she
remained asymptomatic , without recurrent headache , confusion , and
weakness. Her fine finger movements with the right hand were improved
by hospital day 2. She continued to have difficulty with tandem gait ,
falling to the left. Her lipid profile revealed elevated total
cholesterol and LDL. Her homocysteine level was slightly elevated at
14. She was instructed to raise her dose of atorvastatin as well as
supplement her diet with folic acid. She has an outpt appointment for
carotid non-invasive studies 10/25/03.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:
The pt should take a full dose of aspirin ( 325 mg ). She should take
folate supplementation. She should also discuss raising her dose of
atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) with her PCP , because her cholesterol and LDL
were elevated this admission.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: LEFT HIP FRACTURE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. FAT EMBOLI SYNDROME.
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
3. DECUBITUS ULCERS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Lumadue is a 68-year-old man who
came in with a chief complaint of hip
pain after a mechanical fall. The patient had been hospitalized in
4/17 for ischemic right toes requiring debridement and amputation.
At that time , his hospital course was complicated by a non-Q wave
MI. Cardiology have recommended medical management with Lopressor
at that time and an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of
45%. Dobutamine MIBI revealed a severe fixed perfusion defect in
the inferoposterior and inferoseptal left ventricle without any
peri-infarct ischemia. Ejection fraction by MIBI imaging was 26%
in contrast to the echo results. The patient was ultimately
discharged on Lopressor , however , she stopped taking the Lopressor
for unclear reasons. For the few months prior to admission , he
developed increasing dyspnea on exertion with paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and increasing pedal edema , as well as nocturia , however ,
denied any orthopnea , any chest pain , fevers , melena , bright red
blood per rectum or palpitations. A few days prior to admission ,
the patient developed a dry cough and some rhinorrhea.
On the morning of admission , the patient sustained a mechanical
fall while trying to retrieve a newspaper. He had no
light-headedness , palpitations , pain in his chest , nausea or
vomiting , sweating or change in vision or sensory symptoms prior to
or after the fall. The patient fell onto his left side and
immediately developed left-sided leg and hip pain for which she
presented to the emergency room at Fentstraub Neycian's Medical Center .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , cardiomyopathy

ALLERGIES: Aminoglycosides , unknown reaction.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of smoking one pack per
day x40 years , quit five years prior to admission.
He has one drink of liquor per day , lives at home alone in Targtine Highway , Birm , Vermont 21711 , and is in the insurance business.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for mother died of cancer at 74. Father
died at 55 of heart disease. Mother died at 50 of
a heart attack.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Afebrile , temperature 97.3 ,
heart rate 106 , blood pressure 162/77 ,
oxygenation 94% on room air. GENERAL: He was alert and oriented.
LUNGS: Clear. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. PELVIS: Stable.
His left lower extremity had well-healed scars from donor site for
bypass grafting , strong dopplerable PT and DP pulses. His left leg
was externally rotated. Sensation was intact to light touch.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 135 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 102 , bicarb
19 , BUN 56 , creatinine 2.5. White count 12 ,
hematocrit 33 , platelets 388. PTT 40.5 , INR 1.2. EKG showed sinus
tach at 102 , with occasional PVCs , normal axis , normal intervals ,
no evidence of ischemia. Chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary
edema. X-rays of his left pelvis and femur revealed fracture of
the left intertrochanter and subtrochanteric fracture with lesser
trochanteric fracture intact by 3 cm , less than five degrees
angulation. His femoral head was reduced.
IMPRESSION: A 68-year-old man with significant cardiac history
and vascular disease , status post left hip fracture
with mechanical fall , with pulmonary edema noted on chest x-ray.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - Initially , the patient was
to be admitted to the orthopedic service with
medicine consult for wrist stratification. However , the patient
was transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation and
management. The patient was noted to have a troponin leak although
CK enzymes remained negative for ischemia. He had a MIBI performed
which revealed an unchanged fixed defect. He remained in sinus
tach with occasional PVCs and runs of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia lasting 3-4 beats at a time throughout his admission.
Sinus tach was attributed pain and discomfort , possibly with
element of hypoxia contributing as well. A troponin leak was
attributed to strain particularly in the setting of his
tachycardia. He was started on beta blocker , Ace inhibitor and
continued on an aspirin. He was aggressively diuresed with
afterload reduction. He was titrated upward as noted.
2. Pulmonary - The patient's crackles persisted on lung exam after
aggressive diuresis , prompting performance of a chest CT which
revealed an interstitial pattern with peripheral nodularity
consistent with fat emboli syndrome , positive component of
congestive heart failure and aspiration pneumonia as well. The
patient was continued on a regimen of Lasix for diuresis and was
treated for aspiration pneumonia as noted below. His oxygen
requirement diminished over a few days and he was maintained on two
liters of nasal cannula oxygen at the time of transfer to rehab.
3. Renal - The patient developed some renal failure in the setting
of diuresis , which improved with hydration. The patient
subsequently tolerated further diuresis with improvement in his
creatinine and it is possible that renal failure is due to fat
emboli syndrome as well and should improve slowly.
4. ID - The patient was treated with vancomycin , Flagyl and
levofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia , course completed
6/18/02. The patient remained afebrile. His white blood count on
admission and discharge was 12.
5. Neurologically - The patient apparently had baseline mild
perfusion. The possibly worsened due to the fat embolic syndrome
and was at baseline prior to discharge per the patient's daughter.
6. Heme - The patient was continued on Lovenox 60 mg subcu. b.i.d.
for prophylaxis against DVT post-hip surgery to continue for six
months minimal followed by orthopedic surgery.
7. GI - The patient developed some diarrhea. C. diff. cultures
were negative to date at the time of discharge. The patient was
maintained on Nexium prophylaxis in the setting of his
anticoagulation.
8. Endocrine - The patient was restarted on oral hypoglycemics
prior to discharge in addition to sliding scale insulin. The
patient had a Foley and a triple lumen catheter , both of which were
removed on 6/18/02. The patient was evaluated by plastic surgery
for his peripheral vascular disease with ulcers. Recommended dry
sterile dressings to the right and left foot wound changed q.d.
with DuoDerm to the left lower leg wound to be changed q.3 days ,

Discharge Date: 3/2/1995
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE WITH UNSTABLE ANGINA.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HISTORY OF CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS
SURGERY IN 1988.
2 ) ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE SINCE 1983.
3 ) INFERIOR WALL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN
1988.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year old man with
a history of ischemic heart disease
since 1983. He had a non-Q wave myocardial infarction at this time
and in 1988 , he had an inferior wall myocardial infarction and a
subsequent coronary artery bypass graft times three. In 1991 , he
sustained an inferoposterior myocardial infarction and persantine
thallium study demonstrated a fixed inferolateral defect. He was
well maintained on beta blockers and aspirin until September 1992.
At this time , he developed symptoms consistent with unstable
angina. He was ruled out for myocardial infarction at this time.
An echo was significant for hypokinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls and ejection fraction was noted to be 50%.
Persantine thallium in September 1995 demonstrated posterobasilar
defect with 60% redistribution. After this episode , he had again
been symptom free. On 9/13/95 , the patient began experiencing
substernal chest pressure , 10/10 , with radiation to the left arm
with good response to sublingual nitroglycerin with total episode
time of five minutes. On 11/23/95 , he had a similar episode for
approximately two minutes which he rated as a 7/10. On the day of
admission , the patient had a fifty minute 10/10 episode of
substernal chest pressure associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea.
EKG was significant only for non-specific low T waves. Patient was
heparinized , provided with beta blockers , and given aspirin and
nitrates. The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction and the
plan was to do a persantine thallium. The patient continued to
have pain of the chest at rest and was transferred to the Caus Memorial Hospital for further evaluation and cardiac
catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above as well as significant for polio
with subsequent muscle weakness of the left
hip and leg.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission were notable for Lopressor 50 mg
q.6h. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
nitroglycerin intravenous infusion 20 micrograms per minute , and
Heparin 1300 units per hour.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs on admission were notable for a
blood pressure of 112-116/64-84 with a heart
rate of 53-75 , extraocular movements were intact , there was no
jugular venous distention , carotids were 2+ bilaterally , lungs were
clear to auscultation , and cardiac examination showed the point of
maximal intensity was non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm ,
normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , no gallops , and no rubs. Abdomen was
soft , non-tender , and non-distended with no hepatosplenomegaly ,
extremities showed no cyanosis and no edema , femoral pulses were 2+
bilaterally without bruit , and pedal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was notable for a hematocrit
of 40.3 , a white count of 10.8 , potassium
of 3.7 , PT and PTT of 12.7 and 55 with an INR of 1.1 , and
cholesterol was noted to be 287.
HOSPITAL COURSE: While here , Mr. Mollema had one episode of 10/10
substernal chest pressure not associated with
diaphoresis , nausea , or vomiting and relieved with sublingual
nitroglycerin. EKG with pain as compared to old EKG demonstrated
inversion of T waves in V1 through V3 and questionable inversions
in III and F. These inversions were present on a 11/28/95 EKG but
not on a 6/25/95 EKG. The EKG changes with the past medical
history was most likely significant of ongoing instability of the
patient's anginal symptoms and ischemic heart disease. At this
time , the plan was for cardiac catheterization. This is a 57 year
old male with a history of multiple myocardial infarctions in the
past status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1988
admitted with unstable angina and recurrent chest pain at rest.
Aspirin , Heparin , nitrates , and beta blockers were continued.
Cardiac catheterization results were notable for three vessel
disease but the bypass grafts , the LIMA to the left anterior
descending , was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the proximal
descending artery was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the ramus
was occluded , and the left circumflex to the saphenous vein graft
to the ramus may be the culprit lesion contributing to the
patient's pain and EKG changes. The patient was continued on
Heparin overnight post-catheterization and it was deemed
appropriate to PTCA the ramus lesion. The patient was taken to the
Catheterization Laboratory on 1/11/95 for successful PTCA of the
ramus occlusion. Post-procedure , the patient was stable and chest
pain free. Post-catheterization , the patient was afebrile with a
blood pressure of 106/68 and a pulse of 64. The right femoral
catheter site was without hematoma , no bruits , and femoral pulses
were 2+. Dorsalis pedis pulses were intact bilaterally and there
was no cyanosis. The patient was enrolled on the AMH protocol as
per Dr. Androsky and as such , received 36 hours of intravenous
protocol therapy post-catheterization. The right groin sheaths
were removed without difficulty , hematocrit at this time was 35.7 ,
and the patient remained in stable condition with complaint of
chest pain. The patient was discharged home on the fourth hospital
day. Physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of
130/80 , a pulse of 65 , respiratory rate of 20 , temperature of 99.4 ,
O2 saturations of 93 and 94% , and examination was within normal
limits. Cardiac examination showed the point of maximal intensity
non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm , and no murmurs , gallops , or
rubs.
DISPOSITION: The patient is stable upon discharge and symptom
free.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. and
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. four times a day.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Quincy Noble Aldo Zeyadeh at
Vere Hospital

ATTENDING: SEABROOKE , ODELL FORREST MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON ADMISSION: Non-ST elevation , acute
myocardial infarction , and acute renal failure. She was
transferred from the C A Hospital to the Ersullcy Medical Center
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old lady with
diabetes and known coronary artery disease status post CABG and
status post multiple PCIs. She was in her usual state of health
until three weeks ago when she began with classical paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea. She was taken to Ordland University Of Medical Center on
three different occasions in the past three weeks prior to
admission , where she was treated for pulmonary edema. Prior to
her admission to the I.marg Healthcare , she had had a
troponin leak of up to 3.6. This was on the 5 of July . She also was admitted with acute renal failure. Her
creatinine on the 15 of June per note was 1.1. When we
admitted her creatinine was 2.6. This was likely secondary to
the fact that she had received amikacin for urinary tract
infection at the Tawno Health and she had also had a
chest , abdominal , and pelvis contrast CT leading to contrast
nephropathy. When she was admitted , her main problems were the
following: She had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
She was a high-risk patient with a TIMI score of 5. She had
acute renal failure probably secondary to a number of factors
including contrast dye what she had received at the outside
hospital and amikacin which she had received for urinary tract
infection. Her other problem was she had a urinary tract
infection per report secondary to E. Coli resistant to Levaquin
and gentamicin.
Her past medical history was relevant for the following:
She had diabetes type 2 with chronic renal insufficiency
secondary to the diabetes. She has anxiety disorder. She had
coronary artery disease status post CABG in 1992. She is status
post PCI with a stent placed in 2002 , and 2004 apparently. She
also had congestive heart failure with an EF per an echo
performed at Burg Man'stard Memorial Hospital was 35%. She had GERD and
Barrett's esophagus. She had hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia. She had had a pacemaker placed. She had
hemorrhoids. She had osteoarthritis with both knees. She had
spinal stenosis and chronic back pain status post cholecystectomy
and a history of asthma.
Her allergies included the following: Bactrim , penicillin ,
erythromycin , Keflex , Metformin , clindamycin , and ciprofloxacin.
Her social history , she was in a nursing facility. She is
divorced. She has four kinds. Lives in Gle and is often
visited by her children.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her temperature was 96 , her
pulse 77 , her blood pressure was 170/95 , although admittedly it
was difficult taking her blood pressure by auscultation. This
was measured by palpation and confirmed by Doppler. She was
satting 96% on 3.5 L via nasal cannula. She is alert and
oriented x3 in no acute distress. She had arcus senilis. Her
extraocular movements are intact. She had pupils equal , round ,
and reactive to light. Her chest showed bibasilar crackles/rales
two-thirds way up. Her JVP is 10 cm water. Her heart had a
regular rate and rhythm with no gallop. No rubs or murmurs
heard. Her abdomen is benign. Her extremities are warm with no
edema and she is grossly neurologically intact.
Her first set of labs at the Ha Ottejaquesrence Hospital
revealed the following: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 ,
CO2 24 , BUN 40 , creatinine 2.5 , glucose 95 , white blood cell
count of 10.16 , a hemoglobin of 10.0 , platelets 232 , INR 1.5.
Her BNP was 2138. Her lipase was 7. Her troponin level was
0.75.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
Non-ST elevation acute myocardial infarction. On presentation ,
the patient had several EKG changes consistent with an acute
coronary syndrome. She was in normal sinus rhythm with T wave
flattening or inversion in leads V4 to V6 and in the inferior
leads also 2 , 3 , aVF. She had Q-S complexes in V1 through V3.
She was deemed to be a high-risk patient for the TIMI score of
5and they documented troponin leak. She was managed medically ,
not interventionally given her acute renal failure. She was
treated with unfractionated heparin with a PTT level of 50 to 70
seconds. She was given aspirin , Plavix. She was also given
eptifibatide intravenously for five days and is also treated with
beta blockers and ACE inhibitor. After five days , she had no
recurrent chest pain. Her EKG changes were persistent but her
troponin levels have trended downwards and she has really been
asymptomatic in this regard. Regarding her pulmonary edema , we
treated with Lasix initially 40 mg IV Lasix x1 and then on
standing PO Lasix 40 mg daily , and diuresed her and also gave her
morphine and oxygen. Within four or five days , her physical
examination was much better and her crackles and rales had
markedly decreased. On admission , she was saturating 96% on 3.5
L. She progressed. Her oxygen requirements decreased. She was
diuresed and was finally weaned off oxygen and is currently
saturating 97% on room air. The plan is for her to continue on
aspirin , Plavix , high-dose Lipitor , and beta-blocker , and
nitrates as needed.
2. In terms of her acute renal failure , based on the records
from the Trickvan Agi Health Network , her creatinine had jumped from
1.1 to 2.5 in three days. This was felt to be most likely due to
intrinsic renal failure. She did not have a low urine output and
she had received amikacin in the past few days prior to admission
as well as contrast dye and she did have a history of contrast
dye induced nephropathy leading to a predialysis state , although
she did not get dialysis on that occasion. Here , we simply
avoided nephrotoxic agents , were judicious in the use of Lasix
with strict ??____?? controls , and her creatinine gradually began
to decrease and today it is down to 1.6. Infectious Disease
wise , she came with the documented urinary tract infection
reported to be due to E. coli resistant to levofloxacin and
gentamicin. Here , we cultured her again and found E. coli more
than a 100 , 000 colonies , which was resistant to ampicillin ,
gentamicin , ciprofloxacin , and levofloxacin. It was sensitive to
ceftazidime and she therefore received renally dosed ceftazidime
for her UTI to complete a 7 to 10-day course. Blood cultures
drawn on the 24 of April showed no growth to date. The
patient has also been afebrile in with a white blood cell count
between 7 and 11 , 000. In terms of her hypertension , of note , it
has been difficult to measure her blood pressure , probably
measuring her blood pressure in her left arm by palpation is a
most reliable way to do this. She was treated here with
hydralazine , Lopressor , and diuretics. On discharge , she feels
well. Today , she told me that she has not filled this for a long
time. She had no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath.
She is afebrile with a temperature of 98. Her pulse ranges
between 60 and 70. Her blood pressure is between 102 and 150
systolic and she is satting 95% on room air. Her current weight
is 73 kg and she is deemed to be euvolemic so this should be her
target weight and she is ambulating with assistance. She is
alert and oriented x3 in no acute distress. She has got pupils
equal , round , and reactive to light. She has only a few
bibasilar crackles on bases. Otherwise , her lungs are clear.
Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm with no gallops , rubs , or
murmurs. Her abdomen is benign. Her extremities are warm. Her
right calf is quite tender to palpation. She has a documented
old DVT in her gastrocnemius vein. This is old and she has
probably got some postphlebitic syndrome and should be followed.
She is neurologically grossly intact.
Her laboratories at discharge include the following:
Sodium 139 , potassium 4.7 , her creatinine is 1.6 , BUN is 50 , her
white blood cell count is 11.01 , hematocrit 28.5 , hemoglobin 9.2 ,
and platelets 258 with an INR of 1.2.
Her medications at discharge include the following:
1. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg orally daily.
2. Ceftazidime 1 g IV q.24h. until August to complete a
7-day course.
3. Colace 100 mg orally twice a day in case of constipation.
4. Lasix 40 mg orally every 12 hours.
5. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously three times a day , while
the patient is bedridden.
6. Isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg orally three times a day.
7. Lopressor 37.5 mg orally three times a day with hold
parameters , hold if systolic blood pressure is less than 110 , or
a heart rate is less than 55.
8. Sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.
9. Vicodin one tablet every six hours in case of pain.
10. Risperidone 0.5 mg orally once a day.
11. Lipitor 80 mg orally once a day.
12. Plavix 75 mg orally once a day.
13. Celexa 20 mg orally once a day.
14. Esomeprazole 20 mg orally once a day.
15. Lantus 17 units subcutaneously every morning.
16. Novolog sliding scale.
DISPOSITION AND PLAN: The patient is to go to rehabilitation.
Things to do specifically include the following:
She should be diuresed with Lasix as needed to achieve a dry
weight goal of 72 kg. She should continue on ceftazidime for her
urinary tract infection until August and her calf pain -
DVT should be followed , one possibly to raise the Clevewill Ent Hospital as this may represent in a cold malignancy , for which she
may need to be worked up once the acute setting is over.
Studies performed at this hospital include the following:
A renal ultrasound as part of her workup for acute renal failure
reveal a right kidney with a size of 11.8 cm and apical cortical
cyst , left kidney 10.6 cm , and no hydronephrosis. The patient
also had a MIBI , SPECT of her heart , which revealed the
following:
The combined ??____?? ischemia plus scar during the stress were
moderately abnormal with a summed stress score of 9. Her rest LV
ejection fraction was 50%. The patient's PET CT test results
were normal and consistent with a small region of myocardial
ischemia in the septal area and also a focus of ischemia in the
OM territory. She had abnormal global LV systolic function and
these results demonstrated in interval progressing per her prior
study performed on November , 2004.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 61 year old female with
coronary artery disease ( status post
PTCA , myocardial infarction , and coronary artery bypass graft ) who
presented with a few week history of near syncope and evidence of
inappropriate sinus arrest on Holter monitor for pacemaker
placement. Ms. Debrecht 's pertinent medical history was significant
for longstanding peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery
disease. In early 1992 , she first noted the onset of exertional
chest discomfort. Symptoms progressed and an exercise tolerance
test was performed in 1/4 which was standard Bruce protocol at
six minutes and thirty seconds with a maximal heart rate of 160 and
maximal blood pressure of 144 stopping secondary to 2 to 2.5 mm ST
depression inferolaterally. Cardiac catheterization in 6/9
revealed left anterior descending of 80 to 90% and mid right
coronary artery 99% ( with left-to-right and right-to-right
collaterals ). The right coronary artery lesion was PTCA to a 20%
residual which re-occluded and was re-PTCA to a 20% then
re-occluded again ( no PTCA a third time ). Echo in 6/9 revealed
an ejection fraction of 50% , inferior hypokinesis consistent with
prior myocardial infarction , and mild MVP/MR was also seen.
Coronary artery bypass graft times two vessels ( LIMA to left
anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the proximal
descending artery ) was performed in 6/9 ( Dr. Nethery ). Since
then , she had done well with no further chest pain. Starting
approximately one month prior to admission , the patient began to
experience episodes of near syncope. Episodes consisted of the
sensation of light headedness , tunnel vision , tinnitus , and
diaphoresis ( although she felt near-syncopal , she had never
actually experienced true syncope ). During episodes , she
frequently felt the sensation of facial flushing with diaphoresis.
She could not recall precipitating events prior to the episodes but
did note that the events never occurred when she was active , only
when she was at rest ( but not asleep ). Holter monitor on September , 1996 revealed multiple three to four second pauses. The
patient's anti-hypertensive , metoprolol ( 25 mg b.i.d. ) was
discontinued , however , repeat Holter on 10/9/96 revealed multiple
pauses ( 114 pauses in a 24-hour period ) with the longest lasting
4.2 seconds. The patient was then sent to the Sa Ratee for further evaluation and management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As described in Secondary Diagnoses above.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Divorced , retired x-ray technician , former smoker
of one pack per day times thirty years quitting
eleven years ago , and history of ethanol consumption at the time of
divorce. Her primary medical doctor was Dr. Armand Shackelford
( Huban ).
FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a myocardial infarction at age 76
and history of hypercholesterolemia , mother died
at age 86 of gastrointestinal ulceration and had a history of
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , and sister with non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal ulcers.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: ASA 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. ( discontinued three weeks ago ) ,
vitamin supplements ( vitamin E , lysine , Co-Q10 , vitamin C , calcium ,
Centrum Silver , and primrose oil ) , and no over-the-counter
medications.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , Zantac , and Comtrex , all of which produce
angioedema and tetracycline ( sun sensitivity ).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs showed a blood pressure of
160/110 , pulse 92 , temperature 97.0 ,
respirations 16 , and 97% on room air. GENERAL: Energetic white
female in no apparent distress. HEENT: Extraocular movements
intact , pupils equally round and reactive to light , oropharynx
without erythema or exudate , and no cervical lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly. NECK: Supple and carotids 2+ bilaterally without
bruits. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm at 72 with no
rubs , gallops , or murmurs. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation and
percussion. ABDOMEN: Obese with cholecystectomy scar , chest tube
scars , and bowel surgery scar ( right just lateral of the midline ) ,
normal bowel sounds times four , non-tender , non-distended , no
hepatosplenomegaly , and no bruits. EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema , femoral pulses were barely palpable , and distal
pulses were 1+ bilaterally on the right and left lower extremity.
NEUROLOGICAL: Alert and oriented times three , cranial nerves
II-XII intact , strength 5/5 , sensory intact , deep tendon reflexes
3+ bilaterally throughout , and toes downgoing.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: SMA 7 was remarkable for a potassium of
3.9 , BUN 14 , creatinine 0.7 , liver
function tests within normal limits , white blood count equalled
7.8 , hematocrit equalled 41 , and platelets were 233. PT was 12.3
( 1.1 ) and PTT equalled 30.4. Chest x-ray showed status post
coronary artery bypass graft and bibasilar atelectasis but no acute
air space disease and EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 79 with
an axis of 60 degrees , T wave inversion in V2 to V3 with upright in
V4 and V6 , and Q waves in II , III , and F.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 61 year old female with peripheral
vascular disease and coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass graft now admitted for
evaluation and management of near syncope. Holter monitor had
demonstrated persistence of sinus pauses despite discontinuation of
beta blocker ( metoprolol ). The patient was admitted for
observation over the weekend. She experienced multiple sinus
pauses , particularly at nighttime. The longest pause recorded was
4.7 seconds. Though she was aware of the irregular heart rhythm ,
she never became truly syncopal or had evidence of hemodynamic
instability. She was enrolled in the ECTH trial and underwent
placement of a dual chamber pacemaker randomized to the VVIR mode on
9/10/96. She tolerated the procedure without complication. Post-operative
chest x-ray revealed appropriate location of atrial and ventricular leads and
no evidence of pneumothorax. Interrogation of the pacemaker
revealed appropriate response. The patient did well overnight and
was discharged on May , 1996 with instructions to follow-up
with Dr. Passarella in ten days.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged on May , 1996 in good
condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ASA 325 mg p.o. q.d. and Percocet one to
two tablets p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain.
FOLLOW-UP: She was instructed to follow-up with Dr. Lafranca on
August , 1996 at 1 p.m.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCT.
CONTRIBUTING DIAGNOSIS: HYPERTENSION , CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ,
DIABETES , SCHIZOPHRENIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67 year old black
female with a history of diabetes ,
hypertension , coronary artery disease , SVT and schizophrenia
presented with 45 minutes of substernal burning , shortness of
breath and diaphoresis. The patient has a long history of chest
pain which began in 1988 with her first rule out for MI. She has
had extensive cardiac workup including a recent ETT MIBI during
which she went 5 minutes 40 seconds with a maximum heart rate of
71 , blood pressure of 138/68 with no ST segment changes and no
evidence for ischemia. MIBI images: anteroapical defect on stress
images with reperfusion at rest consistent with ischemia. These
studies were done in October of 1992. The patient was thought to have
rate related ischemia which is induced by SVTs or other
precipitants that increase her heart rate. The patient has had no
substernal chest pressures since October of 1992. She experiences no
chest discomfort on exertion. She has had a good rate control on
Lopressor 75mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient presented in the Emergency
Room today complaining of epigastric burning in her chest 1 time a
week which awakened her from sleep at night. It is usually relieved
by Mylanta. On the day of admission , however , the patient
experienced a sudden onset of substernal chest burning without
radiation while lying in bed. She had eaten 1 hour before going to
bed. The pain was accompanied by palpitations , shortness of breath
and diaphoresis. She denied nausea and vomiting. It was not
relieved by Mylanta. The patient received a sublingual
nitroglycerin in the ambulance resulting in relief. The patient's
cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes , history of
tobacco use and hypercholesterolemia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As
above: Adult onset diabetes mellitus , hypertension , a left great
toe ingrown toe nail , diverticulosis , history of frequent nose

q.a.m. , Pepcid 20mg b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 1 tablet p.o. q
d , Librium 10mg p.o. b.i.d. ALLERGIES: The patient has no known
drug allergies. Family history includes a brother who died at 60 of
an MI , a sister who died at 71 of an MI. Social History: The
patient is a widow with 4 children , lives with grandson , a retired
factory seamstress who stopped smoking 25 years ago. She had smoked
a 1/2 pack a day for 5 years and has no history of ethanol usage.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a pleasant black female in no
apparent distress with a temperature of 98.2 ,
pulse of 100 , blood pressure 140/80 , respirations at 16. HEENT:
Pupils were equal , round , reactive to light. Oropharynx was clear.
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits. Lungs
were clear to auscultation. Heart: Heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with distant heart sounds and normal S1 , S2. Abdomen:
Abdomen was with normal bowel sounds , was soft , obese and
non-tender with a hyperpigmented patch centrally. EXTREMITIES:
Extremities are without edema or joint effusions. The left great
toe had hypertrophic toe nails , tender to palpation with an ingrown
toenail. Rectal was with guaiac positive stool. NEURO: Neuro exam
was grossly non-focal. Skin had no new rashes.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Admission data included a sodium of 144 ,
a potassium of 4 , chloride of 107 , bicarb
of 27 , BUN of 24 , creatinine of 1.1 , glucose of 155. CK was 430
with an MB fraction of 1.5 and as an aside , the patient is known to
have chronically elevated CKs. White count was 8.7 , hematocrit of
36 with an MCV of 90 and 93 , 000 platelets. PT 13 , PTT 30. LFTs
were within normal limits. EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at
95 beats per minute with intervals of .18 , .81 , .35 and axis of 21
with Q waves in V1 , V2 , T wave flattening in V2. Chest x-ray was
without infiltrates or effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospital course by system: The patient was ruled
out for MI , had CKs of 430 with an MB fraction of
1.544 with an MB fraction of 1.9 and 404 with an MB fraction of .8.
There were no further EKG changes. The patient had no chest pain
while in the hospital. The patient's Lopressor was increased to
75mg q.i.d. while in house and the patient also underwent a
diagnostic cardiac catheterization with the following results: An
LAD without critical stenosis , an OMB1 with a 90% proximal stenosis
and OMB2 with diffuse disease and serial lesions , an RCA with a
proximal 90% stenosis and a distal 70% stenosis , and normal
ventricular function. The patient was offered PTCA of her critical
lesions and the patient declined. As the patient had not been
compliant with her medical regimen , it was felt that we would send
her out on her increased dosage of Lopressor and monitor her level
of chest discomfort and perhaps re-offer her PTCA at a later date.
The patient's toe was evaluated by podiatry who felt that she had ,
in fact , an ingrown toenail which was treated via avulsion of the
margin of the nail and a 4 day course of Cephradine 500mg p.o.
q.i.d. The patient had all Ansaid held secondary to her guaiac
positive stool and her hematocrit monitored and it suggested that
the patient have a GI workup as an outpatient. The patient had
anemia which was thought secondary to chronic GI bleed. Iron
studies performed while in house detected an iron level of 31 ,
total iron binding capacity of 246 , a B12 of 904 , folate of 10.4 ,
and a ferritin of 235; all not consistent with iron deficiency
anemia. The patient also presented with thrombocytopenia which was
thought perhaps secondary to Pepcid or Ansaid. These medications
were held while she was in house and her platelet level remained
approximately 100 and was so upon discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient continued her normal medical regimen for
schizophrenia and was discharged in stable condition
on the following medicines: MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin
325mg a day , Librium 10mg b.i.d. , NPH insulin 42 units sub q
q.a.m. , Lopressor 100mg p.o. t.i.d. , verapamil SR 240mg p.o. q d ,
Prolixin Decanoate 12.5mg IM q o weekly and nitroglycerin 1/150 1
tablet sublingual q 5 minutes x 3 p.r.n. chest pain. The patient
will have home health aid and VNA services to ensure more
compliance with medication regimen and diet , also to check finger
stick glucose every day , blood pressure every week and to
administer her Prolixin every week. The patient is recommended to
be on a 800 ADA diet and will have follow-up with Dr.
in the CO Clinic.

Discharge Date: 11/2/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Trudell is a 69 year old woman
with a history of coronary artery
disease , status post an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in
January 1996. She had a cardiac catheterization at the time , which
showed an 80% mid left anterior descending artery lesion , and 80%
left circumflex lesion before OM1 , 50% proximal right coronary
artery lesion , and an 80% posterior left ventricular branch lesion.
She was also noted to have inferior and anterolateral HK with an
ejection fraction of 52%. The patient expressed her desire to be
managed conservatively , and was medically managed for the following
year. She had a sub-max exercise tolerance test prior to discharge
and one month later had a full BRUCE protocol going six minutes
with less than 1 mm ST segment depressions in several leads. The
patient did well for the past year without symptoms until 1:00 a.m.
on the morning of admission when she woke from sleep with
substernal chest pain. She took sublingual nitroglycerin with
relief after half and hour but at 3:00 a.m. the pain recurred with
nausea. The patient took two sublingual nitroglycerin with
resolution of the pain by 4:00 a.m. She presented to the emergency
department free of pain and electrocardiogram at the time showed
changes consistent with anterior ischemia. The patient was
admitted with unstable angina for evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include simvastatin 10 mg q.h.s. ,
sublingual nitroglycerin , enalapril
5 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: She had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pulse of 62 , regular and blood
pressure 160/80 , respiratory rate 12 , oxygen
saturation of 99% on three liters nasal cannula. There was no
evidence of jugular venous distention , carotids 2+ bilaterally , no
bruits. Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm and an S4 was
present. Abdomen was obese , soft , nontender and nondistended with
normal bowel sounds present. Extremities were without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission the patient's initial CK was 111.
Her second CK was 452 , with an MB fraction of
45.1 , third CK was 550 with an MB fraction of 47.9 , and a fourth CK
of 439 with MB fraction of 33.5 , fifth CK of 261 , with MB fraction
of 14.9 , and a sixth CK of 156. SMA seven was normal.
Troponin I was 0.0 on admission. White blood count of 11 ,
hematocrit 39.7. Chest x-ray was unremarkable for any infiltrate
or any congestive heart failure evidence. Electrocardiogram
revealed normal sinus rhythm at 75 , axis 0 , 2 to 3 ST segment
elevation in V1 through V3 , 1 mm elevation in V4 , less than 1 mm ST
segment depressions in 1 , AVL , and V5 , V6. These changes were new
compared to a previous electrocardiogram from January 1996.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to CCU , at which time
she was pain free and her electrocardiogram
abnormalities had resolved. Her heart rate and blood pressure were
controlled with intravenous medications and she was managed
medically until hospital day three when she was taken of the
cardiac catheterization laboratory. Cardiac catheterization
revealed a 90% plus left anterior descending artery lesion distal
to D1 with evidence of thrombus , 60% proximal left circumflex
lesion with diffuse disease in the OM1 , a 40% right coronary artery
lesion , left ventriculogram revealed anterior lateral apical and
septal HK and AK. The patient returned to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory the following day for PTCA and stenting
of her left anterior descending artery lesion followed by ReoPro
infusion. From the time of her admission to the Cardiac Care Unit
throughout her hospital stay the patient did not have recurrence of
her chest pain. Cardiac enzymes returned to baseline.
Electrocardiogram revealed ST segments also returned to baseline.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Include aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Ticlid 250
mg p.o. b.i.d. for 11 days , Atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enalapril
20 mg p.o. q.d. The patient is instructed to resume a low fat , low
cholesterol diet. Activity as tolerated.

Discharge Date: 11/19/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
OTHER PROBLEMS: 1. STATUS POST CHOLECYSTECTOMY
2. ASTHMA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 41 year old
Afro-American woman who has the
diagnosis of inferior wall myocardial infarction on 4/26/95
transferred from Rahert Hospital for postmyocardial infarction
angina.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Hypertension , smoking , family history of
coronary artery disease , and CVA. No
diabetes. She is not postmenopausal , no history of elevated
cholesterol. No previous myocardial infarction history.
Two and a half weeks prior to admission while sorting mail , she had
20 minutes of Cushing substernal chest pressure , increased
shortness of breath with diaphoresis and radiation down the left
arm and across to the right chest. Initially , she thought she had
gastrointestinal distress. Pain often appeared 1 to 2 hours after
eating , was not associated with exertion , and is questionable if
affected by position. There were no EKG changes. In the intervening
period she had several additional episodes of this pain and
presented to HMC where she was treated with Disalcid and Tagamet.
The pain persisted in a crescendo pattern until 4/26/95 when she
presented to LSSHA with a complaint of two days of unrelenting chest
pressure. She was sent to Ai Community Hospital where she ruled in for
myocardial infarction with a CK equal to 1508 MB fractions. MB of
126 with a peak of 1900 on 8/6 EKG demonstrated Q waves in 3 and
ADF. T waves aversions of 2 ST segment depressions in V2 through
V5. She was treated with IV nitroglycerin , heparin , oxygen ,
diltiazem , Metoprolol and aspirin. She apparently had additional
pain while on this regimen and was transferred to the Campte Hospital for catheterization and management.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications as an outpatient were only
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q day. Upon transfer her
medications included Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg once a
day , Diltiazem CD 240 mg once a day , Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d. , IV
nitroglycerin , IV heparin , and Percocet for pain.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies , but has an allergy to seafood
- she gets hives.
FAMILY HISTORY: As above. Coronary artery disease and
cerebrovascular accident in the early 40's in both
her father and mother.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She smokes one pack a day of cigarettes for the
past 20 years with occasional alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit at
the Mouth- Butlham Hospital is notable
for a blood pressure of 130/85 , the pulse is 79 , respiratory rate
of 16 to 20 on three liters of 100% face mask. HEENT exam -
sclerae are anicteric , pupils equal and reactive to light ,
extraocular movements are intact , oropharynx were clear. There were
no carotid bruits , jugular venous pressure at 6 cm flat. Chest -
there was a poorly healed scar on the anterior chest. Lungs were
clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. No CVA
tenderness. Cardiac exam - PMI nondisplaced , regular rate and
rhythm , normal S1 , split S2. There is a 2 out of 6 whooshing
crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the left upper sternal
border that radiates to the apex. There was an S4. Abdomen - obese
with a surgical scar in the right upper quadrant. No
hepatosplenomegaly. Femoral pulses are intact with a right bruit.
Extremities were without edema , symmetrical distal pulses.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal. Reflexes were intact. Toes were
downgoing bilaterally.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION: Notable for potassium of 3.8 , a white
blood cell count of 13.6 , hematocrit of
37.8 , platelets of 179 , magnesium 2.3 and CK of 201 , PT-PTT 13.2 ,
59 with an INR of 1.2. Urinalysis was notable for 25 to 30 white
blood cells , 5 to 10 red blood cells , 2+ squamous cells , 1+
leukocyte esterase. There were no effusions or evidence of failure
on chest x-ray.
HOSPITAL SUMMARY: On admission this is a 41 year old woman with
multiple cardiac risk factors who ruled in for
an inferior wall myocardial infarction and is now experiencing
postmyocardial infarction pain either secondary to current angina
versus pericarditis , although there was no EKG evidence to support
this. In the IH she was treated with heparin , beta blocker ,
aspirin. Calcium channel blocker was discontinued. IV
nitroglycerin was continued , oxygen. The patient was scheduled for
a catheterization of the heart the morning after transfer with
pretreatment of 60 mg of Prednisone x two for history of shellfish
allergy. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 10/12/95
with the results being right atrial filling pressure of 8 ,
pulmonary capillary weight pressure of 12. There was a third OM
( first large OM was noted to have a thrombus nonobstructive with
good distal flow. ) The remainder of the coronary arteries were
deemed normal. On the 7 of October , the patient was transferred
out of the Coronary Care Unit to the stepdown unit. Of note ,
postcatheterization femoral pulses were 1+ bilaterally with a bruit
on the right which was there prior to catheterization. An
echocardiogram done demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45 to 50%
with posterior hypokinesis and mild mitral regurgitation. On the
7 of October , the patient was noted to have a white blood cell
count of 20.7 at this time , PTT of 74.3. EKG was notable for T wave
inversions in 2-3-S , V2 through V6 which were seen on EKG's from
1/7 The patient's MI was felt to be consistent with a lesion
from the thrombus seen on catheterization. It was thought at this
time that the increased white blood cell count was most likely
secondary to the Prednisone given as pretreatment prior to
catheterization. The patient's does of Lopressor was increased to
75 mg four times a day to achieve a heart rate in the 60's. She was
continued on the stepdown unit on Heparin , IV nitroglycerin and
continued on cardiac monitor. On the 29 of July , the patient
had an episode of recurrent pain 3 out of 10 , radiating to the left
arm with no associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting , but slight
diaphoresis. At note , at this time , the IV nitroglycerin was being
weaned down. Her vital signs at this event were 130/90 with a pulse
of 80. Cardiac exam was notable for a normal S1 , S2 and S4 , no new
murmurs noted on exam. Lung was clear. EKG was notable to be a
sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 with T wave inversion and 3 and R
which were old , as well as ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2
which were old and suitable normalization in V6. She was given one
sublingual nitroglycerin and the IV nitroglycerin was dialed up.
She was likewise given 5 mg IV push of Lopressor for recontrol and
Serax 15 mg x one. Her chest pain was reduced to 2 out of 10 with
these interventions with no radiation in the arm. She described it
as a heaviness. Blood pressure was 144/87 , pulse was 74. EKG at
this point was notable for sinus rhythm at 75 , normal intervals. T
wave inversions in 3R ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2 , V3 , V5
with T wave sinusoidality and V6 T wave slightly inverted. IV
nitroglycerin was dialed up further , morphine 2 mg x 1 was divided
and oxygen two liters , nasal cannula was in place. Patient was
pain-free with these interventions and a second 5 mg IV Lopressor
was given for better late recontrol. Duration of total episode was
approximately 20 minutes. The pain-free EKG was notable for a rate
of 78 wit V5 T wave more upright than sinusoidal and V6 T wave
upright , else no change. The IV TNG was dialed up further for a
blood pressure of 129/76 and rate was now 70. A second bolus of IV
morphine was obtained at this time. CK and Isoenzymes were sent
and Cardiology attending was made aware. The patient was made NPO
in case of any need for catheterization the following morning if
symptoms were to recur. The CK following this event was magnified
with a triponin I of 14.1. On the 29 of July it was deemed
appropriate to continue with the IV heparin one more day and
control symptoms with IV nitroglycerin. if the symptoms were to
increase , it was still deemed appropriate to considering this
patient for recurrent cath. On the 20 of February , the patient
returned to catheterization which demonstrated a discrete 90%
distal left circumflex stenosis. There was a PTCA performed of this
distal stenosis which left a residual 60% stenosis. A stent was
placed in the distal stenosis to provide a 0% residual stenosis.
The lesion in the proximal circumflex developed a greater than 50%
stenosis during the procedure , and two stents were placed in the
proximal left circumflex to provide a 0% residual stenosis for a
total of three stents in place in the left circumflex. EKG's were
stable postcatheterization. There was no remarkable hematoma in the
right groin. CK postcatheterization was 64. On the 18 of November
the patient's Lopressor was changed to Atenolol and the patient was
started on Coumadin for the stents. The patient at this time on
6 of October had a heart rate in the 68 to 75 range with a
blood pressure of 120/75% , O2 sats were 99%. As the patient was
being coumadinized on the 18 of February , she had a
supertherapeutic response coumadinization with an INR of 5.7. The
plan was to recheck the INR to secure a downward trend as well as
to start planning for discharge. On the 24 of April , the INR
was 4.6 , demonstrating a downward trend with a subsequent maximum
INR , while supertherapeutic , of 6.5.
DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged home on June with
followup with Dr. Mathur and Dr. Stailey at the For Nali Hospital
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Aspirin 325 mg po b.i.d. , Anusol
Suppositories one suppository pr q day ,
Atenolol 125 mg po q day , Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. , Lisinopril 5 mg

Discharge Date: 3/16/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old female
with a history of lupus , hypertension ,
asthma , breast cancer status post mastectomy and chemotherapy ,
rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation who was found
pauses of up to 6.6 seconds on a Holter monitor and was admitted
for consideration of pacer placement. The patient states that over
the last several months since October , 2001 , she has noted
increasing dyspnea on exertion and decreased exercise tolerance.
She also has noticed episodes of palpitation. She presented to her
primary care physician in October , 2001 with these complaints. He
put a Holter monitor on her 10/1/01 which showed her to have
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rates between 67 and 214 with a
mean rate of 117 beats per minute. Her primary care physician , Dr.
Esmond , initially put the patient on digoxin and Coumadin. Her
rate remained elevated , however , so he changed the Coumadin to
Cardizem. About one month ago he also added propafenone 150 mg
p.o. t.i.d. On 10/5 she presented to her cardiologist , Dr.
Cowser , complaining of continued palpitations and ankle edema.
He stopped her Cardizem at that time as he felt that was what was
contributing to her lower extremity edema and placed her on
atenolol 25 mg p.o.q.d. instead. She had a leepy Holter monitor
placed from 8/29/23. Wednesday morning , her second day of
atenolol , she noted having episodes where ""I felt my heart pause
and then surge when it started to beat again"". This was associated
with lightheadedness x several seconds. She did not have any
associated chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea and vomiting ,
diaphoresis or syncope. She called Dr. Cedotal on 6/16 and he
told her to stop her atenolol and continue her propafenone. Over
the last two days she has had flutter episodes of irregular heart
beat but has had no lightheadedness since stopping the atenolol on
Wednesday. She has noted increased shortness of breath over the
last couple of days , as well , on climbing one flight of stairs.
She also has orthopnea using two pillows at night , does not have
PND , does have lower extremity edema. On the day of admission
which was 10/25/01 Dr. Mcferrin received a transmitted Holter recording
from Viewden Medical Center that showed the patient had normal sinus rhythm with
episodes of atrial fibrillation with high rates but also that she
had episodes of 6.6 second pauses. Thus , she called the patient
and had her sent via ambulance to the Cole General Health
emergency department for consideration of admission for pacemaker
placement. In the emergency department the patient's vitals were
she was afebrile with a pulse of 112 , blood pressure 150/81 ,
breathing 18 , satting 95% on room air. Her review of systems was
negative for fever , chills , or sweats , chest pain , syncope ,
abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria or rash. In
the emergency department she revealed 40 of IV Lasix and was sent
to the floor.

hematocrit 29.1 which was around her baseline. Her baseline had
been 30-38 on the last admission. Her platelets were 289. ESR was
75 which is what it had been in July . INR was 3.1
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular
redistribution. Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at
94 with a normal axis , normal intervals. She did have left atrial
enlargement as well as right atrial enlargement. Her last echo
done at MH on 10/13/01 showed an ejection fraction of 63% ,
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , LV systolic function
preserved , a thickened mitral valve , moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation plus left atrial enlargement , aortic valve thickened ,
mild AI , no AS. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation , moderately
increased pulmonary artery pressures , normal RV plus her atrial

From a pump standpoint we felt that perhaps her mitral
regurgitation was the main cause of her 2-3 month history of
increasing dyspnea on exertion , exercise intolerance , and
increasing orthopnea. Thus , we got a repeat echo which showed
borderline left ventricular hypertrophy with an estimated ejection
fraction of 55% , normal RV. The mitral valve was moderately
thickened and rheumatic in appearance. The mitral valve area was
estimated at 1.3 cm squared although this may have an under
estimate. There is severe mitral regurgitation and moderate left
atrial enlargement. The aortic valve was calcified. There was
mild aortic insufficiency. There was mild tricuspid regurgitation
with a regurgitant velocity of 3.5 consistent with mild elevation
in pulmonary systolic pressures of approximately 48 mmHg plus right
atrial pressure. Given her severe and symptomatic mitral
regurgitation we then decided that she would likely benefit from a
mitral valve replacement. Then we proceeded to cardiac
catheterization. Her left heart catheterization showed a left
dominant system with clean coronary arteries. Her right heart
catheterization revealed elevated right ventricular and pulmonary
artery pressures and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of
31. She was diuresed several kg from her admission weight with IV
Lasix and she was continued on her ace inhibitor for afterload
reduction. Consultation with Dr. Mazingo of cardiothoracic surgery
was obtained and he felt that patient would indeed benefit greatly
from an MVR. Thus , plan was made for patient to be discharged home
and then to be readmitted electively when Dr. Brocks returned from
vacation for an MVR. From a rate and rhythm standpoint , the
patient was in normal sinus rhythm for the majority of her hospital
stay. We continued her propafenone and Coumadin for her history of
atrial fibrillation and she did have excellent rate control on
this. She had no further pauses on telemetry during hospital stay
and thus it was felt that given she was asymptomatic and did not
have any pauses off of beta blockade , that she did not need
pacemaker placement on this admission.
2 ) Pulmonary: From a pulmonary standpoint we felt that likely she
had cardiac asthma as with diuresis her wheezing and shortness of
breath was nearly 100% improved.
3 ) Rheumatology: From a rheumatologic standpoint her lupus was in
good control. She did not have of her typical lupus flare symptoms
such as arthralgias or rash , fever and , thus , we continued her on
her Plaquenil , her chloroquine and her prednisone.
4 ) Renal: She did not appear to have any renal involvement of her
lupus and her renal function was within normal limits throughout
her stay.
5 ) Heme: She had a normal cytic anemia at 29 which was within her
baseline range of 29-38. Full iron studies were sent and it was
felt that it was most likely consistent with anemia of chronic
disease.
6 ) Prophylaxis: From a prophylaxis standpoint she was on Coumadin
for atrial fibrillation so was not considered for heparin and she
was continued on Prilosec throughout her stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Plaquenil 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.; lisinopril 40
mg p.o.q.d.; magnesium gluconate 2 grams
p.o. b.i.d.; prednisone 10 mg p.o. q. a.m.; propafenone 225 mg p.o.
t.i.d.; Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.d.; K-Dur 60 mEq p.o.q.d.; Flovent 220
mg inhaled b.i.d.; Flonase 2 sprays nasally q.d. for her allergies
and postnasal drip; Prevacid 30 mg p.o.q.d.; chloroquine 100 mg
p.o.q.d.; Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
FOLLOWUP: She had an appointment to follow up with Dr. Flecther
in one week's time and to follow up with Dr. Druvenga in
two weeks' time when he returned from vacation. At that time would
then follow up with an elective admission for MVR.

Discharge Date: 3/30/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old Hispanic
female with insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus and hypertension , who fell at home approximately 1 week
before admission. She suffered a right-sided Colles fracture that
was treated with closed reduction and half cast. Furthermore , she
suffered a nondisplaced left-sided patella fracture , which was
primarily treated with a knee immobilizer. Since the follow-up
x-ray of the distal radius 1 week after trauma showed shortening
and dorsal angulation , the patient was admitted for closed
reduction and external fixation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY reveals
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , anxiety. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY reveals she is status post open reduction and
internal fixation of a left-sided tibial plateau fracture 9 months
ago. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Verapamil 80 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , Chlorthalidone 50 milligrams by mouth per day ,
humulin-N 40 units subcutaneously each morning , multivitamin 1
tablet by mouth per day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a 62 year old
female in no acute distress. Lungs were
clear. Cardiovascular examination showed regular rate and rhythm ,
III/VI holosystolic murmur , regular S1 and S2 , no S3 or S4. Abdomen
was soft , nontender , no palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities showed the right forearm and wrist immobilized in a
splint , there was regular VMF of all 5 digits , good capillary
refill , radial and ulnar pulses were 2+/2+. Left knee had positive
effusion , no signs of ligamentous instability , straight leg raising
possible , but with 15 to 20 degree extension deficit.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , x-ray of the left knee , PA
and lateral , shows nondislocated patella
fracture ( fracture line almost not visible ). Distal radius PA and
lateral showed shortening and dorsal angulation of the articulate
surface. On admission , electrolytes were within normal limits ,
blood urea nitrogen 23 , creatinine 1.3 , hemoglobin 13.0 , hematocrit
38.2 , white count 8 , 100 , platelet count 411 , 000 , prothrombin time
12.3 , partial thromboplastin time 23.4. Urinalysis was without
pathological findings.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 9 of February , the patient underwent closed reduction
and external fixation of her distal radial
fracture. The patient tolerated the procedure very well and the
postoperative course was without complications. Postoperative
x-ray control showed an optimal result with anatomical reduction of
the radial articulate surface. During the early postoperative
course , the radial ramus of the radial nerve seemed to be
irritated , but recovered without any further intervention and the
patient was without any neurological deficit from the 4th
postoperative day on. While the left leg was immobilized with a
brace , the patient started to ambulate with a platform walker and
with full weight-bearing on the left leg. Prior to discharge , the
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. Serial electrolytes ,
blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were within normal limits.
Leukocytes were 8 , 000 , hemoglobin 12.9 , hematocrit 38.0 , platelet
count 489 , 000 , last blood glucose level prior to discharge from
7:00 am was 169 , 4:00 pm 73 , 10:00 pm 230. The pin sites on the
right forearm were without signs of infection. X-ray control done
on 13 of August , showed unchanged positioning of the right radius , as
well as the left patella.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE are the same as on
admission. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable. The
patient is going home. The plan is for postoperative FOLLOW-UP in
1 week at the Orthopaedic Clinic of Wyckbastroit Center .
Until then , the patient is advised to keep the right arm elevated
and to seek medical attention in case of fever , reddening of the
pin sites , and/or secretion from any pin site. Hence , the patient
is not able to do her finger sticks for blood sugar measurement by
herself , and Visiting Nurse Association was ordered.

ATTENDING: ALFRED JUZA MD
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Johnathon Jamieson , M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Wizar is a 51-year-old man who
was recently admitted for repair of left pseudoaneurysm in his
groin. He was in home and doing fine after discharge from
Ea Naron Medical Center on 6/14/2003. One week later , he
noticed pus draining from his wound site. He was doing daily
dressing changes at home. He was seen in Dr. Hearston 's office on
6/2/2003 with only mild improvement. He was admitted from
clinic for more aggressive management. He has no history of
fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , constipation , or diarrhea. No
chest pain and no shortness of breath.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam , he was afebrile. Vital sings are
stable. He is 100% on room air. He had on the left , 2+ femoral ,
no DP , monophasic PT pulse with cold foot. On the right , TMA ,
warm foot , femoral 2+ , DP monophasic , PT monophasic. Wound site
with some erythema and drainage , nontender , no odor.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease status
post CABG , peripheral vascular disease status post aortobifemoral
bypass and status post femoropopliteal bypass , COPD , chronic
renal failure , and diabetes mellitus.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Repair of pseudoaneurysm.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg once a day; digoxin 0.125 mg once a
day; Zestril 2.5 mg once a day; Ultralente 14 mg q.a.m. , 4 mg
q.p.m.; Zocor 10 mg once a day; Toprol 25 mg once a day; Imdur 30
mg once a day; torsemide 100 mg once a day; and Dilaudid p.r.n.
ALLERGY: He has an allergy to penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: One pack a day smoker. Occasional alcohol.
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was admitted for IV
antibiotics and further surgical therapy with the diagnosis of
dehiscence of left thigh bypass graft wound. He received
wet-to-dry dressing changes t.i.d. initially. On 3/2/2003 , he
was taken to the operating room for left groin closure with flap
by Plastic Surgery and Vascular Surgery. The flap initially was
pink and viable , however , on 5/14/2003 , there were noted some
pale areas and mottling of the flap. He was injected with
heparin solution. Following this , flap received serial needle
pricks and the appearance gradually improved as such there was no
further pallor or mottling. The patient developed diarrhea. He
was on vancomycin , levofloxacin , with p.o. Flagyl for empiric
treatment for C. diff. C. diff cultures were negative on
10/16/2003 , in addition his drain cultures on 10/20/2003 , showed
rare Staphylococcus aureus. On 3/2/2003 , repeat culture of
the groin were negative. He had an episode of nausea , which
improved after Flagyl was discontinued. The patient was seen by
Cardiology during his stay here. On postoperative #2 , he was
noted to be volume overloaded. His torsemide was increased to
100 mg b.i.d. with goal diuresis of 1-2 liters per day. IV Lasix
was added p.r.n. to achieve this goal. After his episode of
nausea , his EKG was checked to rule out any sort of cardio
ischemic cause for this nausea , EKG was normal. His morphine was
discontinued as a possible cause. He did well with p.o. pain
medications. Renal: His Zestril was held secondary to an
elevation in creatinine to 3.3 from his baseline of 1.8. This
gradually resolved. Creatinine was 2.5 at the time of discharge.
The patient was also seen by the Nutrition and recommended
supplements , vitamin C , and Zinc for wound healing. By
10/16/2003 , the patient's flap was stable , pink , and viable. He
had lower extremity pulses that were Dopplerable. He was
discharged home in stable condition with services.
Discharge medications include enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg once
a day; digoxin 0.125 once a day; Ultralente 16 units q.a.m. , 4
units q.p.m.; Zocor 10 mg once a day; Toprol 25 mg once a day;
Imdur 30 mg once a day; torsemide 100 mg once a day; lisinopril
2.5 mg once a day; colace; and Percocet.

Discharge Date: 3/28/1993
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 53-year-old right
handed man who was admitted to the
neurology service on 1/10/92. He has a two week history of right
sided slowly improving. The neurology service felt that the
findings on exam was most consistent with cervical disc disease and
they asked neurosurgery to consult. In brief , the patient's chief
complaint is right sided weakness. The patient was in his usual
state of health until approximately three and a half weeks prior to
admission. He noted pain in his right shoulder over four to five
hours , the pain increased. He also noted numbness in his right
toes. His right hand was weak as well and he had difficulty
holding a cup. Conservative management failed , i.e. , bedrest. He
came to the emergency room at the request of his local doctor and
was admitted to the neurology service. While here , on Decadron ,
Motrin and Flexeril , he noted some improvement. Of note , he fell
flat on his face first on 10/21/92 and sustained a sprained ankle.
At that time , he had no back or neck pain. While in house , he felt
that he could walk three times around the Ingnorf At that point , he
experienced weakness and numbness on the fourth trip around. He
has also noted some urgency since the onset of his neck pain. He
has normal peroneal sensation except for the transient occurrences
of some saddle distribution of abnormal sensation. He has
constipation which has now improved. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: L4-5
laminectomy in 1970 and 1982. In 1980 , he had a perforated ulcer.
In 1982 , he had surgery for a hiatal hernia. In 1983 , he had a
cholecystectomy. In 1984 , he had a partial gastrectomy and
colectomy for swallowing a toothpick. He has a history of anxiety
attacks related to highway driving. He is a past smoker , stopped
seven years ago after three packs per day times 40 years. History
of alcohol abuse but does not drink now. He has no cardiac ,
respiratory or GI disturbances.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed the patient to be
afebrile. Vital signs were stable. General
exam was within normal limits. He had full range of motion with
increased pain with extension of his neck. He was alert and
oriented with a normal mental status. Speech was fluent with no
dysarthria. Cranial nerves were entirely within normal limits. He
had no pronator drift. On the left he was 5/5 throughout. On the
right he had 5- strength in his biceps , triceps , wrist extensors
and intrinsics. Hip flexors were 4/5. Knee flexors and knee
extensors were 4/5. He was essentially 5/5 throughout the rest of
his lower extremities. His reflexes were 1-2+ in his upper
extremities and approximately 3+ at the knees with downgoing toes.
He had 3-4 beat clonus on the right. Coordination was okay
bilaterally. Gait tested revealed a tendency to fall with
decreased ability to weight bear on the right. Sensory exam
revealed decreased sensation in the right hand and the last three
digits of the left hand. He had no subjective numbness in his
right leg , on the dorsum of his left foot , he had decreased
sensation with a cut off before the toes.
MRI was a poor quality study which showed C5-6 and C6-7 disc bulge.
CAT scan showed severe stenosis of C6-7 with osteophyte , moderate
stenosis at C5-6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen by Dr. Dubey who agreed
with the plan for C5-6 and C6-7 laminectomies.
He was taken to the operating room on 10/8/93. Preoperative
diagnosis with cervical stenosis with myelopathy. Postoperative
diagnosis was the same. The procedure was C4-5 , C5-6 , C6-7
laminectomy. He had a Hemovac placed postoperatively. The
estimated blood loss was less than 100 cc. Postoperatively , he did
very well. He had good upper extremity strength which seemed to
improve. He was seen by physical therapy. He had a slightly
swollen calf and had noninvasive vascular studies of his lower
extremities which were negative. He did , however , note some
shooting pain in his left lower extremity. His wound was clean and
healing well. He was out of bed with a walker. The plan was for
discharge home. He may need further evaluation of his lumbar spine
at some point but he seems to be doing well with Percocet only.

onset of nausea and vomiting two to three times a day and severe
constipation. There was no blood in her vomit , no sick contacts ,
no bowel movements for the past four or five days , no hematemesis ,
and no fever or chills. She was unable to keep down any p.o. She
also noted over the past week an increase in her chronic bilateral
arm pain and onset of new right scapular pain. Arm pain and hand
pain had been attributed to carpal tunnel syndrome in the past.
She reported chest pressure but denied shortness of breath ,
diaphoresis , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , and any other
chest pain syndrome. Patient also complained of right upper
quadrant epigastric abdominal tenderness. She had a history of an
open cholecystectomy in 1980. She did not drink alcohol and she

and white blood cells 5-10.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the general medical
service with abdominal pain and hyponatremia.
Abdominal pain was felt to be secondary to longstanding
immobilization and morphine precipitating constipation. Abdominal
CT was negative. Pain improved with aggressive bowel regimen. She
was found to have a neurogenic bladder and developed hematuria due
to Foley trauma. This cleared with irrigation and ofloxacin
treatment times five days was recommended by urology. She had a
follow-up plastic surgery appointment scheduled for the following
day after discharge. Her hyponatremia of 115 resolved with
hydration with normal saline. Patient was discharged with normal
liver function tests and normal amylase and lipase. Serum sodium

Hospital Course:
57 yo F with complex medical history here with mental status
change likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy with some component of
medication-induced delirium ( from opiates ).
++Mental Status - Avoided increasing narcotics. Given lactulose QID.
Mental status improved significantly in first 24 hours of
hospitalization. Patient then remained at her baseline mental status for
rest of hospital stay.
++MSK - Patient has history of chronic low back pain that is
likely related to bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures seen on MRI on
6/5/06. We avoided increasing her narcotic dose for concern of her
altered mental status. Pain was controlled effectively with MSIR prn ,
celecoxib daily prn ( should not increase to bid given ? increase risk of
cardiac side effects ) , and a lidoderm patch over her lower back. Other
NSAIDS were avoided given h/o GI bleed. Patient is scheduled to f/u with
Dr. Stayner ( Rheumatology ) for management of her back pain and
consideration of sacroplasty. Patient should be seen by PT at her nursing
home to help her with her walking.
++GI/ID - Had low-grade fevers overnight on HD 1 and 2. Patient had mild
RUQ tenderness which raised a question of possible GI / biliary source of
infection. Blood cultures were positive for coag negative staph in 2/4
bottles. She was treated with Ciprofloxacin and
Metronidazol starting on HD 1 , and vancomycin until speciation of blood
cultures. Blood cultures repeated on 11/18 and 7/27
were negative to date. Coag neg staph blood cultures were thought to be
due to contamination. Patient has remained afebrile and abdominal
tenderness has resolved over hospital stay. Vancomycin was discontinued
on HD 3 and Cipro and Flagyl were continued. She was discharged with
instructions to complete a 14-day course of Cipro and Flagyl. Her WBC
count and platelets decreased gradually throughout her hospital stay and
were 3.88 and 122 respectively. A CBC should be checked on Monday 6/25 to
make sure that she is not becoming neutropenic or thrombocytopenic.
++Pulm - The possibility of PE was considered given lower extremity
swelling and her change in mental status. Given that she was at her
baseline oxygen requirement and had negative LENIs , PE was thought to be
low probability. She remained at her baseline oxygen saturation ( 93-98%
on room air ) for the duration of her hospitalization. Given flovent for
known COPD.
++CV - EKG at admission was unchanged from previous EKGs. Patient's dose
of Lopressor was decreased , given her low BP at time of admission. Her
heart rate and blood pressure remained in the normal range throughout her
admission.
++Endo: MRI read from 3/8/06 showed evidence of osteoporosis. Started
caltrate , vit D. Unable to give fosamax because of history of esophageal
varices. Giving zometa x 1. Corrected calcium was normal. Will need to
re-check calcium in 1 week.
++FEN - Given thiamine , folate , fluids , Is/Os , weights.
++PPX - Lovenox , nexium , aspiration precautions.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You are being discharged from the hospital to your nursing home in
Smerfortn Blvd , Stin with a few changes in your medications. We have changed your pain
medication to MSIR every 4 hr as needed , celebrex , and lidoderm patch.
Please call your doctor if you are feeling that your thinking is not
clear or if you start to have fevers. And please return to the emergency
department if you are having increased abdominal pain , chest pain ,
difficulty breathing , or other concerning symptoms. You should have your
blood counts checked on Monday and your calcium checked next week.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Follow up with Dr. Vargas at next available appointment. Please call Dr.
Megeath office to schedule. Follow up with Dr. Blandin and Dr. Pfleider
as scheduled. Patient should be seen by physical therapy at her nursing
home. Patient should have a CBC drawn on Monday 6/25 to check her white
count and platements , which were trending down slowly throughout her
admission and recheck calcium ( corrected for albumin ) in one week.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76 year old female
with history of an inferior myocardial
infarction , coronary artery disease , and diverticulosis initially
admitted on 11/6/98 for conservative treatment of acute
diverticulitis. She was discharged on 10/30/98. The patient now
presents for elective sigmoid colectomy. The patient had had no
recent angina since her prior admission in January of 1998. According
to the patient she has rare , about one time every two weeks ,
episode of stable angina which presents as left arm pain relieved
by sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient did not present with any
pattern of unstable angina. The patient denies recent fevers ,
chills , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , bright red blood per rectum ,
melena , cough , or pneumonia. The patient does report dyspnea on
exertion after climbing approximately one flight of stairs. The
patient has orthopnea as she sleeps with two pillows.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Status post myocardial infarction times two.
History of atrial fibrillation. History of
atrial flutter. Status post cardioversion times three in 1994.
History of hypertension. History of rheumatic heart disease.
History of congestive heart failure. Non-insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus. History of two deep venous thromboses in 1970s.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Mitral valve commissurotomy. Mitral valve
repair with St. Jude's valve in 1981.
Appendectomy. Left hip fracture.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , sulfa , aspirin , Sotalol , as well as
Procainamide and Quinaglute.
MEDICATIONS: Lasix 80 mg , Lopressor 180 mg t.i.d. , Glyburide 10 mg
b.i.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg q.d. , Plaquenil 200 mg
b.i.d. , Isordil tempids 40 mg t.i.d. , and Coumadin 5 mg q.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well developed , well nourished female in no
acute distress. Lungs clear to auscultation
without crackles. Heart: Mechanical S1 and normal S2. Abdomen:
Soft , nontender , nondistended. Bowel sounds positive. 2+ edema to
calves bilaterally. Feet were warm and dry with normal capillary
refill.
LABORATORY DATA: ECG was significant for normal rate , atrial
fibrillation rhythm. No acute ST-T wave changes.
The patient had Q-waves in leads 3 and aVF. The patient's x-ray
was consistent with pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The cardiology service was consulted with the
recommendations that the patient be diuresed
aggressively , daily weights and ins-and-outs be followed , and fluid
and sodium restriction to patient. The patient was placed on
heparin preoperatively.
On hospital day #2 preoperatively , the patient was admitted to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit after she experienced a hypotensive
event with systolic blood pressure in the 50s with associated
drowsiness while maintaining her own airway. The feeling was that
the patient's event was likely secondary to the initiation of
Verapamil for rate control of her atrial fibrillation. The rate
control was then continued with Lopressor and Verapamil was held.
Goal potassium greater than 3.5 and magnesium greater than 2 were
maintained. The patient's diuresis was continued. The patient was
felt to be stable for surgery.
On hospital day #3 , 3/29/98 , the patient was brought to the
operating room for sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis , as
well as drainage of abscess. Postoperatively , the patient was
transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further
monitoring of her cardiopulmonary issues. Postoperatively , the
patient progressed well. She was maintained on perioperative
Vancomycin , Levofloxacin , and Flagyl. Cardiovascularly , she was
maintained on Lopressor , Nitropaste , Hydralazine , and Digoxin for
her atrial flutter. The patient did well on the floor , tolerating
IV to p.o. pain control , reinstitution of Coumadin for
anticoagulation , tolerating regular activity. Of note ,
the patient completed a rule out for myocardial infarction by
serial enzymes and ECGs. The patient was seen by the physical
therapy service and noted to have progressively improving activity.
The patient was discharged in stable condition.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to the Chemu Ford11 Memorial ,
a rehabilitation hospital. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Plaquenil 200 mg

8/21/98 and 3/27/98 ; 5 mg p.o. q.d. starting on 5/6/98. The
patient should have PT and PTT with INR checked three times a week
on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday. She has a goal INR of 3.0. The
patient is not being discharged on Glyburide 10 mg b.i.d. because
she has had consistently low blood sugars. Fingerstick blood
glucose should be checked b.i.d. with resumption of Glyburide when
necessary. FOLLOWUP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Ezra Tripodi in the Ispunx Medical Center surgical clinic in one to two weeks. She

been holding onto a strap on the bus with her left hand and suddenly
felt unable to hold on any longer and she felt tingling on her left arm.
While this was happening , she also became acutely confused and didn't
recognize her own neighborhood or even the house across from hers. She
was able to stand up and walk off of the bus as well as up five steps on
her front porch with assistance from the bus driver. By the time she
reached the front porch , 5 minutes after her symptoms started , she was
back to her normal self. At no time during this did she experience
headache , dizziness , vision/hearing changes , abnormal smell or nausea.
Her other extremities were not involved. She also never lost
consciousness.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: During this admission we evaluated your heart to make sure that it
was not the cause of your pain. In fact , your studies were improved from
your previous studies of yoru heart. It seems that your pain is likely
more due to your shoulder arthritis since the heart study we
performed was negative for blood flow problems to the heart. When you
have shoulder pain , you should try heat to the painful area ( or ice if
that helps more ) as well as Tylenol. You may also try ibuprofen in small
doses. Ibuprofen ( also known as Advil or Motrin ) is available in generic
form in your drugstore. It is not good for your stomach or your kidneys
so you should take only a very small amount as detailed in your discharge
summary. Because you had low blood sugar on admission to the hospital
we would like for you to take your diabetes pills only once a day
instead of twice a day until Dr. Daghita tells you differently.Your
medications are otherwise unchanged from your medications prior to your
admission. If you have weakness , shortness of breath , or
any other concerning symptoms you should seek medical attention
immediately.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Adjust pain medications for shoulder pain
2. Referral for physical therapy
3. Adjustment of oral hypoglycemics if FSBGs are high - oral agents have
been reduced to once daily as pt was hypoglycemic on admission

The patient is undergoing chemotherapy with Adriamycin and
cytoxan and is status post cycle 2 on 9/6/06 and began to
feel like she was recovering from her chemotherapy approximately
three days prior to admission. A spinal MRI obtained on Tuesday
to evaluate her spinal stenosis was uneventful but later on that
day the patient developed redness on the dorsum of her right hand
in the area in which her IV was placed per the MRI. The
following morning the patient had a pustular lesion on the fourth
digit of her right hand distal to the dorsal redness and went to
EH Urgent Care where she received one dose of ceftriaxone and
was given a p.o. script for Augmentin. She was sent home but at
home she developed expulsive diarrhea and vomiting on that
evening , was not able to tolerate her oral antibiotics. The next
day she noticed a similar lesion on the fourth digit of her left
hand looking much like that on the right hand. She returned to

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone in Te She has a
very sad social history in which her husband is a TX war
veteran and came back to the Ra and was service
connected with the pofield medical center of psychiatric
disturbances following his tour of duty. She has had three sons ,
two twins who died earlier in life of some unspecified heart
illness and a third son who died at the age of 21 after a long
hospital stay with clear cell sarcoma of bone. She lives alone
in a second floor walkup in Du near Inslareca Cou Pla She
has a distant history of tobacco 50 years ago. She rarely drinks
alcohol. Her friend and healthcare proxy is Ezekiel Stoviak , and
the phone # 288-186-2874.
FAMILY HISTORY: There is no history of breast cancer. Mother
had colon cancer. Three aunts and maternal grandmother also had
colon cancer. Her son had a clear cell sarcoma of bone.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ,
lightheadedness and dizziness associated with her chemo but she
denies fevers , chills , sweats in the past 72 to 96 hours prior to
admission. She did have chest pain on 3/28/06 two days after
her chemo but none since and in the time leading up to her
hospitalization.
ADMISISON PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature was 98.9 , pulse 98 , blood
pressure 132/55 , respiratory rate 16 , 95% on room air. The
patient's physical exam was significant for alopecia and obesity.
She was in no acute distress , alert and oriented. Her pupils
were equal , round and reactive. Conjunctivae were pink. She was
anicteric and her oropharynx was clear. JVP was hard to assess
due to neck fullness and she wears hearing aids. The lungs were
clear to auscultation except for decreased breath sounds with
crackles at the left base. Cardiovascular exam was regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 , S2 and no murmur , rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft and benign. Extremities had trace to 1+ edema.
The patient had an approximately 4 x 2 cm area of redness but no
swelling , positive warmth and positive tenderness on the dorsal
surface of her right hand. She had a pustular lesion on her left
fourth digit and right third digit that had been I&D in AH
Urgent Care.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs are significant for creatinine of 1 , white
blood cell count of 4.33 , hematocrit of 25.5 and platelets of
108. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a leftward axis and
first degree AV block. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is a 72-year-old woman with
stage III or stage IV breast cancer who now presents with
paronychia and possible cellulitis of her right and left hands.
Infectious Disease: The patient was initially started on IV
vancomycin given the proximity of her recent chemotherapy. Her
finger lesions and dorsal right hand lesions began to heal within
two days of her admission. She underwent incision and drainage
of her left hand's pustular lesion with improved speed of healing
and decreased pain. After 48 hours in the hospital the patient's
vancomycin was switched to Keflex at which time the patient
developed a area of redness on her left forearm that measured
approximately 6 cm x 4 cm in area. The lesion was notable for an
erythematous base with punctuate red lesions that did not appear
to be blanching. At the same time , she developed a very similar
lesion on her right index finger between her MCP and PIP. The
patient was switched back to IV vancomycin and the Infectious
Disease consultants were called to assist with the management of
the patient's evolving lesions. A TTE was obtained that showed no
vegetations and serial blood cultures showed no bacteremia. The
Infectious Disease consultants suggested that the patient had
paronychia in her digits with transfer of bacterial infestation
due to skin breakdown in the area around her nails on her hands.
The concern for septic emboli for which the patient was initially
treated became less likely in the setting of the new lesions that
were not in distribution that has been consistent with septic
emboli. 48 hours later the patient was again switched from
vancomycin to Keflex and within 12 hours developed new
maculopapular rash on her right neck and furuncles on her left
and right outer labia that were exquisitely painful. The patient
was given one more dose of IV vancomycin and then resumed on
Keflex. Dermatologists were consulted to help determine whether
the patient was suffering from shingles and they deemed that she
was not and that her new rash was likely eczematous in nature and
topical steroid creams were prescribed. The new rash on the
right neck quickly resolved and the furuncles on her labia were
symptomatically managed with sitz bath three times daily in
addition to her oral cephalosporin antibiotic.
Throughout the course of evolving dermatologic findings that the
patient experienced and the pain associated with them the patient
had continued to have absolutely no systemic complications
associated with these lesions. In particular , she did not have
fever at all during the course of her hospitalization , she did
not have chills or sweats , she developed no new heart murmurs ,
and her blood cultures remained negative throughout the course.
The patient was started on IV acyclovir when her new rash
developed and on the day of discharge was switched over to
Valtrex 1000 mg t.i.d. for management of presumed HSV infection
though cultures remained pending at the time of discharge. The
patient will be discharged on Keflex and Valtrex to complete a
course of ten days on each.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of type II diabetes , was
placed on a weight based insulin regimen with good effect during
the course of her hospitalization. On discharge , she will resume
her Lantus 40 units nightly.
Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of diastolic
dysfunction with a clean cath in 2005. Her aspirin , statin ,
Zestril , Cardizem , Lasix and nitrates were continued during the
course of her hospitalization in the same way that she takes them
at home with very well controlled blood pressures and no issues
with her rhythm.
The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea but does not
use CPAP and do not have any difficulties with her oxygenation
even while sleeping.
Heme: The patient was initially anemic and thrombocytopenic on
admission. She received one unit of packed red blood cells and
her hematocrit remained stable through the duration of her
hospitalization.
Oncology: The patient has ductal carcinoma and inflammatory
breast cancer that is likely stage IV and she is status post
cycle 2 of 16 of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Adriamycin and
cytoxan with a plan for surgical removal after her
chemotherapy.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home with VNA
services and physical therapy at home.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You have been admitted to the hospital with chest pain. Your chest pain
is likely due to a combination of your coronary artery disease and
anxiety. You did not have a heart attack. Rather this appears to be
stable angina and your current medication regimen is maximized for this
treatment. You also developed a fast heart rhythm called atrial flutter
when you were admitted , but your heart returned to normal rhythm on its
own. Thus , no medications are being started for this. As an
outpatient you will get an ECHO and also some heart monitoring that
will be arranged by Dr. Sapper You will be called with the times for
this. You should continue the same medications that you were previously
taking. If you develop light-headedness , chest pain , or shortness of
breath , you should call your doctor.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
*PCP - patient will need ECHO and Cardiac Monitoring as an outpatient.

Hospital Course:
62yo F with HTN , asthma and recent L total knee replacement
presented with extensive PE. She was extremely SOB and c/o pleuritic
chest pain. Her ekg and exam were not suggestive of cardiac
dysfunction. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient was initially
anticoagulated with Heparin. However , her platelets were noted to drop
from 237 to 93. HIT was suspected and Heparin was discontinued. The
patient was started on Fondaparinux. A PF4 Antibody was sent and pending
at the time of discharge. Coumadin was started after one day of
Fondaparinux with an intent to bridge over at least 5 days with a goal
INR of 2-3. The patient's blood pressure was decreased over the course of
her admission. All antihypertensives were held. She may be preload
dependent in the setting of an acute PE. During her admission an
echocardiogram was performed. It did not show evidence of right heart
strain or LV dysfunction. Her EF was 65-70%. Over the course of the
hospitalzation , the patient's symptoms improved dramatically. Her oxygen
requirement decreased. Her vital signs remained stable.
The patients respiratory status remained stable on home regiment
of inhalers and nebulizers PRN.
Ortho evaluated the patient while hospitalized and recommended weight
bearing as tolerated. The patient did not require narcotics for pain
associated with TKR.
Heparin products should be avoided. The PF4 antibody will need to be
followed by the PCP.

Discharge Date: 9/27/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old man with
ischemic cardiomyopathy , estimated EF
15-20% who presents with an 8-10 pound weight gain over the past
3-5 days , increased fatigue. Also reports increased shortness of
breath which has progressed over the past few months and notes that
he now gets shortness of breath after walking as few as 10-20
steps. He also complains of lightheadedness but denies chest pain ,
palpitations. He also complains of occasional sweats and chills
without nausea , diarrhea , constipation , melena , or bright red blood
per rectum. He reports that lately his blood sugars have been
lower than usual , in the 40s-80s. Denies orthopnea , PND , or lower
extremity edema. Denies dietary indiscretions or medical
noncompliance. However , there is a recent history of discontinuing
certain medications and the patient is unclear to which medications
he should actually be taking at this point.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction in 1979 and 1985 ,
status post three-vessel CABG in 1987 , ischemic cardiomyopathy ,
estimated ejection fraction 15-20% , cardiac cirrhosis ,
hypothyroidism , nephrolithiasis , gallstones , irritable bowel
syndrome , psoriasis.
ALLERGIES: He has no known allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Torsemide , Synthroid 100 mcg p.o.q.d.;
Lantus 98 units subcu q. a.m.; potassium
60 mEq p.o. b.i.d.; Humalog insulin 12 units subcu q. a.m. and q.
p.m.; Restoril 30 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Xanax p.r.n.; Prozac 40 mg p.o.

Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Aldactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. Per patient
his digoxin , Captopril and Aldactone have been on hold. Apparently
these were held after a clinic visit on 1/23/02 via Dr. Mcmeans
when the patient was complaining of orthostatic symptoms and his
torsemide was held over the past five days prior to admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 96.8 , heart rate
72 , blood pressure 91/63 , breathing 95% on
room air. GENERAL: This is a comfortable , pleasant gentleman in
no acute distress. Alert and oriented x 3. HEENT: Normocephalic ,
atraumatic. Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Moist mucous
membranes. NECK: JVP estimated at 12 cm/water. LUNGS: Decreased
breath sounds at bases , otherwise clear to auscultation.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal S1S2. Regular rate and rhythm. No heart
sounds. No murmurs , rubs or gallops appreciated. ABDOMEN: Soft ,
nontender , obese. EXTREMITIES: Warm , no clubbing , cyanosis or
edema. 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 1.2 , troponin-I 0.06.
Electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm at 67 beats/minute , first
degree AV block , left axis deviation , right bundle branch block. Q
waves in II , III and AVF consistent with old inferior infarct. All
these findings unchanged from the prior EKG in 2/14
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1. ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
3. VOLUME OVERLOAD.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
5. HYPOTHYROIDISM.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: The patient on admission was
clinically volume overloaded. He was diuresed
with torsemide IV boluses with good response. He was diuresing two
liters negative per day on torsemide IV or p.o. as well as
spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. However , his clinical volume status
were difficult to assess and accordingly on 8/12/02 he underwent
right heart catheterization and tailored therapy. By report his
right atrial pressure on right heart catheterization was 17 , his
wedge pressure was 43 and pulmonary artery pressure was 65/37
indicating that he still has substantial volume overload. On
therapy his vasodilators were cautiously added to decrease his
systemic vascular resistance and total vascular resistance with
success with low doses of Captopril. His PA catheter was
discontinued on 6/24/02. He has continued to be diuresed with
torsemide 10 p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. He should
be at or near euvolemia on 11/10/02 and he was discharged on a
diuretic regimen of torsemide 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. and spironolactone
25 mg p.o.q.d. in addition to Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
Ischemia: There were no ischemic issues during this hospital
admission.
Rhythm: Electrocardiogram with first degree AV block. The patient
was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospital course. No
evidence of significant arrhythmias were noted. No further workup
was pursued from a rhythm standpoint.
2 ) Endocrine: The patient had a history of hypothyroidism. It is
unclear how this came to be but at some point in the past his
Synthroid had been stopped and only relatively recently restarted.
He had been maintained at a dose of 225 mcg q.d. in the past. When
he was restarted on Synthroid by the outpatient endocrinologist ,
Dr. Escudero , his Synthroid was started at a relatively low dose and
titrated slowly upwards because of his severe cardiomyopathy and
there was concern that increasing his dose too quickly would
precipitate angina. On admission his TSH was 50 and after some
discussion with Dr. Pimpare his Synthroid was increased to 125 mcg
p.o.q.d. On 9/22/02 an endocrine consult was requested because on
7/30/02 his repeat TSH of 75.8 , T4 of 6.5 and a THBR of 1.10.
Endocrine consult recommended increasing Synthroid to 150 mcg
p.o.q.d. and slowly titrating Synthroid upwards by no more than 25
mcg q. 3-4 weeks to a goal of 200 mcg per day , again slowly
titrating upwards to reduce the risk of precipitating angina.
Further management of his hypothyroidism could be done on an
outpatient basis.
The patient also on admission had a history of Type II diabetes
maintained on insulin. His insulin doses had been titrated
downwards during his hospital diabetes mellitus because of low
fingersticks , likely secondary to a relatively healthy diet while
in the hospital. He required only 60 units of Lantus insulin q.
a.m. He was discharged on that dose with Humalog 10 units subcu q.
a.m. and q. p.m. to be followed and possibly titrated back upwards
by his outpatient endocrinologist , Dr. Wakeham
3 ) Psychiatric: The patient had a history of depression and
during this admission he was maintained on his outpatient
medications of Prozac and Restoril. His Prozac dose was titrated
upwards to 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. without any notable side effects. He
was discharged on this dose , 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. No further
psychiatric evaluation or interventions were required during his
inpatient stay. His mood remained stable during this admission.
4 ) Renal: The patient's creatinine was monitored throughout his
hospital course remaining relatively stable despite diuresis. No
further renal evaluation or intervention was required during this
hospital stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient was discharged on 11/10/02 on e
following medications: spironolactone 25
mg p.o.q.d.; Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; torsemide 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d.; simvastatin 80 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Lantus insulin 60 units
subcu q. a.m.; Humalog insulin 10 units subcu q. a.m. and q. p.m.;
K-Dur 40 mEq p.o.q.d.; Synthroid 150 mcg p.o.q.d.; Prozac 60 mg
p.o. q. a.m.; Restoril 30 mg p.o.q.d.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , ISCHEMIC
CARDIOMYOPATHY , DIABETES MELLITUS ,
HYPOTHYROIDISM , DEPRESSION.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , ISCHEMIC
CARDIOMYOPATHY , VOLUME OVERLOAD ,
HYPOTHYROIDISM , DIABETES MELLITUS , DEPRESSION.
CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition afebrile on 11/10/02 without
shortness of breath , without chest pain , without any complaints.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged home with VNA arranged to visit him
on 8/13/02 for the first time to monitor his weight ,
to monitor his electrolytes and to monitor his blood sugars and to
adjust his insulin and diuretic dose as needed.
FOLLOWUP: He was instructed to follow up with Dr. Edwardson in
1-3 weeks and to follow up with his outpatient
endocrinologist , Dr. Adelmund , in 1-2 weeks. Physical therapy was also
arranged for home physical therapy to begin after discharge.

Discharge Date: 4/14/1997
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: ( 1 ) UNSTABLE ANGINA
( 2 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
( 3 ) DIABETES MELLITUS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old female
with history of coronary artery
disease who presented with unstable angina. The patient's cardiac
risk factors include diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , and
post-menopausal. She presented to an outside hospital in 1992 with
substernal chest pain. A cardiac catheterization at that time
revealed an right coronary artery with diffuse disease , moderate to
severe proximal left anterior descending artery lesion at diagonal
1 , moderate mid- left anterior descending artery lesion , and a
tight left circumflex. She underwent a PTCA of the left circumflex
artery with improvement. She was well until approximately one year
ago when she began having exertional chest pain. Her chest pain
has been worsening over the past several months and has been
occurring with less and less exertion. She was admitted in July
of 1996 for chest pain and ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
An exercise Thallium test was negative. She was well until February
of 1997 when she again developed exertional chest pain. She said
that the chest pain was substernal. It had no radiation and no
nausea or vomiting and no diaphoresis. She had an exercise test on
10/15/97 where she was only able to exercise for three minutes and
stopped secondary to shortness of breath. She was scheduled for an
elective catheterization on 9/20/97 but her chest pain has been
slowly worsening over the past couple of months. She reports a
history of exertional chest pain at only one-half block. Normally
her chest pain was relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. On
the evening prior to admission she woke up at 3 a.m. with severe
substernal chest pain. She had no relief with three sublingual
nitroglycerin and , therefore , presented to the emergency room.
In the emergency room she was made pain-free with IV nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease as above. Diabetes
mellitus.
MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. qhs , and Metformin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the emergency room
department with chest pain but became pain-free
with sublingual nitroglycerin. The heparin was started in the
emergency room and the patient was given aspirin. The patient's
admission ECG demonstrated sinus bradycardia with no changes from
her previous ECG.
During the first several days of admission the patient began
complaining of some left chest pain but , on further questioning ,
the pain was under her left breast and radiating to her right back
and she was tender to palpation. Examination under the left breast
revealed three to four vesicles on an erythematous base felt to be
consistent with zoster. The patient was therefore started on
Famvir with some improvement of the pain and the lesion. In
addition to the superficial chest pain the patient did have some
chest pain which was felt to be cardiac in origin although she did
not have any ECG changes. She was continued on nitroglycerin and
heparin and her Lopressor was increased as tolerated.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on 5/26/97.
Although the final catheterization report is not available yet , the
catheterization showed three vessel disease with normal left
ventricular function. It was felt that the patient needed to go
for coronary artery bypass graft but , due to the fact that she had
the herpes zoster under her left breast , it was decided to wait to
do the coronary artery bypass graft until her zoster had improved.
Therefore the patient was discharged to home and will undergo
coronary artery bypass graft in several weeks. Prior to discharge
the patient was seen by surgery and anesthesia for her preoperative
workup. There were no complications.
